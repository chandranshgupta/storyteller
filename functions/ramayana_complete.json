  "Bālakāndam and Ayodhyākāndam": "The immortal Epic of Valmiki is undoubtedly one of the gems ofliterature,—indeed, some considering it as the Kohinur of the literaryregion, which has for centuries, and from a time reaching to the dim andfar past been shedding unparalleled and undying halo upon the domainpresided over by \"the vision and the faculty divine.\" The burthen of thebard's song is the perpetual contest between good and evil,that iseverywhere going on in this mysteriously-ordered world of ours,and whichseemingly sometimes ending in the victory of the former,and at othersin that of the latter,vitally and spiritually results in the utter overthrowand confusion of evil and in the triumph and final conquest of good.Rāma sprung from the bright loins of the effulgent luminary of day,and bringing his life and being from a long and illustrious ancestry ofsovereigns, Rāma taking birth among the sons of men for chastisingand repressing rampant Iniquity and Injustice, typifies thespirit of good that obtains in this world,—Rāvana, that grim andterrible Ten-headed one, a Rakshasa by virtue of birth, and worthyto be the chief and foremost of Rākshasas by virtue of his manymisdeeds and impieties, who challenges and keeps in awe the wholehost of the celestials—\"to whom the Sun did not shine too hot, andabout whom the Wind did not dare to breathe,\" represents the spiritof unrighteousness and evil. Lakshmana, disregrading the pomp andsplendours of princely life, to follow his beloved brother Rāma intothe forest, and cheerfully undergoing there a world of trials andprivations, and daily and nightly keeping watch and wardover his brother and his spouse in their cottage,—and Bharata,stoutly and persistently declining, despite the exhortations ofthe elders and the spiritual guides, to govern the kingdom duringRāma's absence in the forest, and holding the royal umbrella over hisbrother's sandals,are personations of the ne plus ultra of fraternal love,and consummate and perfect ideals of their kind. The righteousBibhishana, who for Rāma's cause forsook his royal brother, and setsmall store by the splendours of royalty, who suffered no earthlyconsiderations to interfere with his entire and absolute devotion tohis friend, embodies in his person the sterling virtues goingunder the precious name of friendship. The ever-devoted Hanumanaglorying in the appellation of Rāma's servant,—ever-prompt at thebeck and call of his master to lay down his life—is the grandest andloftiest conception of the faithful servant that is to be found in allliterature. Shall we say aught of Rāma and Sitā, or keep silenceover themes too sacred for babblement and frofane mouthing?The kingdom is astir and alive with the jubilations of the populaceat the prospect of Rāma's coronation; pennons by thousands arestreaming like meteors in the air at the tops of stately edifices;and drums and panavas and other musical instruments aresounding forth the auspicious anouncement. The royal householdswims in a sea of bliss surging and heaving on all sides. Delightand Joy move about and laugh and talk under the names ofDaçarātha and Kaucalya. Anon a thunder-clap bursts in the midst of theMerry-making, and converts delight into dole, the sounds of laughterand hilarity into loud wails and lamentations issuing from heartsknowing no consolation. All is lost! Rāma is to be banished intothe woods for fourteen years. He cheerfully makes up his mind andrepairs to the forest in consonance with his father's promise. Sitāsteps forth—a divinity clad in flesh—Sitā would follow the fortunesof her lord. She considers it as the height of undutifulness to remainbehind, continuing to enjoy the pleasures of the palace, while herbeloved Rāma is leading a life of toils and privations in the remotewoods. The daughter as well as the daughter-in-law of kings,brought up in the lap of luxury and amidst the soft ministrationsof those pleasures that pertain to a royal household, Sitā, the idol ofevery one's love and regard, boldly and with alacrity faces all thetoils and terrors of a forest-life, in preferance to remaining inDaçarātha's residence, bereft of the company of her sweet lord."

  "Bālakāndam and Ayodhyākāndam": "All these and various other characters that figure on thefascinating and enchanting boards of Valmiki, have been developedfully and elaborately, and with and perfect consistency ofportraiture through the length of his gigantic poem ofRāmāyana. Rāvana standing before us in stupendous proportions as thepersonation of terror and wrong-doing, before whom the humanspirit trembles as Sitā in the Asoka wood; the lotus-eyedRāma self-forgetful and heroic, and possessed of the highestperfections that can adorn humanity, and through the extremes ofmisery and misfortune ever abiding by righteousness and truth; Sitāthe best and fairest of her sex, the embodiment of all loveliness andgrace physical and mental, she who rose from the sacrificial fire ofinspiration—a goddess in all her manifold perfections and unsurpassedexellences, whose name carries in the very mention a world of pathos;the faithful Lakshmana, aye cleaving to his brother on the perilousedge of raging battle, and in the dreary forest leading a life lornand desolate,—these and others whom we forbear reluctantly toname, have been pourtrayed to the life; they are quick with thePromethean spark and occupy prominent positions in that ideal worldbrought into being by those mighty intellectual wizards—the poets;and are the perennial fountains of our joy and sorrow, never sufferingthe good and the beautiful to degenerate into cant and commonplacein our minds. Oh! the privilege of genius."

  "Bālakāndam and Ayodhyākāndam": "The influence exercised by the Rāmāyana upon the Hindus reachingdown to the lowest strata of the society, is literally and in actualfact immense. Truly of the Rāmāyana it can be said in Baconianlanguage that it has come home to the business and bosoms of allmen. If there is one test which more than another distinguishes thetrue from the false in Art, it is the circumstance of a workinfluencing or not influencing life: a work that assimilates itselfwith the mental constitution of a nation, lending energy to impulse,contributing to clearness of thought, and ennobling and spiritualis-ing the higher emotions and aspirations, must by the veryreason of its doing so, be true; while that which fails in doingso, is not the real and genuine thing and can well be spared.The Rāmāyana has become a household-word in Hindu Society,and expressions embodying the memories of incidents celebratedin the epic, pass current amongst all ranks of the people, beingmouthed alike by high and low, by prince and peasantry the aristocracyand the nobility of the land, by merchants and mechanics, bycultivators ploughing the field, and by shepherds keeping the flock, byprincesses and high-born dames in towering edifices, and the womenof the peasantry plying their daily tasks, religionists and politiciansand men of letters,—in short by the community universally. Suchabsolute and all-commanding and comprehensive sway and influenceof literature is perhaps unknown in the West, with the singleexception of the Bible. Rāma's regime embodies the popular conceptionof administrative perfection—the ideal of a monarchy. Rāvana isremembered not only in consequence of the prominent part heplays in the Rāmāyana, but also on account of his famous advice toRāma immediately before his death,—namely that the execution ofevil projects should be deferred, but that good ones should bepromptly executed,—a very sage counsel doubtless, answering partially toMacbeth's observation on hearing of Macduff's escape:"

 {
  "Bālakāndam and Ayodhyākāndam": "\"The vow concerning the bow-breaking,\" applied sarcasticallyto a case of contumacy, \"The war between Rāma and Rāvana ismatched by that war alone,\" \"Rāvana's family.\" \"Rāvana hathbeen ruined by domestic disclosure,\" \"Lankā hath met withdestruction in consequence of excess of pride,\" \"That won't render theRāmāyana incorrect,\"—these are some of the adages universallycurrent in Hindu society, mixing constantly into common talk.Does not this unequivocally and unmistakably prove that the influenceof Valmiki has entered into the pith and marrow of the nation, andvitally sways its intellectual and emotional tendencies?"
 },
 {
  "Bālakāndam and Ayodhyākāndam": "Sitā has become the grand exemplar to Hindu women as theembodiment of purity, chastity, and wifely fidelity. She has furnishedHindu ladies with the highest and noblest conception of their dutiesin their various and manifold relations in life. Her empire isboth wide and deep over the hearts of her sex, performing for theireternal behoof spiritual services of incalculable worth. She shouldbe looked upon as one of the greatest teachers of her kind—as ateacher in that highest and best sense in which Christ and Chaitanya,Nanat and Socrates are called teachers. Ah, who can say howmany women have turned away in the budding prime of youth fromthe primrose path of dalliance, and have in preferance followedvirtue, who alone is truly fair,—how many stirred and influencedby the example of her matchless self-sacrifice have firmly made uptheir minds to tread in her foot-steps? In like manner it may besaid of almost all the principal characters of the Rāmāyana, that theyhave more or less deeply influenced the thoughts and sentiments ofthe people."
 },
 {
  "Bālakāndam and Ayodhyākāndam": "Further, the Rāmāyana has been all along a reservoir uponwhich subsequent writers have drawn ceaselessly. Indeed most ofthe succeeding poems owe to the Mahabharata and the Rāmāyanafor their subjects. Not to mention writers of less note, evenKalidasa's self has dunk deep of that fountain. Bhababhuti notless celebrated has composed a poem treating of the latter part ofRāma's life and saturated with a pathos which perhaps no other penhas surpassed."
 },
 {
  "Bālakāndam and Ayodhyākāndam": "To the antiquary and the student of oriental literature andmanners, a knowledge of the Rāmāyana is simply indispensable.Together with the Mahabharata with which it is joined in popularparlance, and with which it goes hand in hand in compass andvariety of information, but to which its superiority is pronounced inpoint of epic excellence and consistency and uniformity ofexecution, the Rāmāyana constitutes the great repository of wisdom andlearning, the manners and customs of the ancient Hindus. Indeed,the adage current in our socity with regard to the Mahabharata, \"Whatis not in Bharat (Mahabharat), is not in Bharat (India)\" applies toIhe Rāmāyana as well. In it, cosmogony and theogony, the genealogiesof kings and princes,—of human and extra-human beings,of Ashuras and Dānavas, of Yakshas and Gandharvas, and Shiddhasand Charanas; folklore and anecdotes and legends, and stories half-mythical and half-historical; descriptions of cities existing at aperiod long anterior to the age of Troy and Memphis, and thechronicles of kings that reigned before Priam and Busiris,—all thesewith others too numerous to enumerate, have been woven into themighty web and woof of the magic drapery evolved by the so potentart of Valmiki."
 },
 {
  "Bālakāndam and Ayodhyākāndam": "Nor is the poem less interesting in a political point of view. Itcan hardly be questioned that all progress to be real and intrinsicmust be developed out of the inherent tendencies of a nation—thefeelings and sentiments and idiosyncracies into which it is born aswell as those which have been stamped on its life and mind by thestress and exigencies of circumstances, social and political. Fora nation, therefore, to govern another with such an object as thatwith which England has taken upon herself the Government of thiscountry—namely, the progress and advancement of the childrenof the soil—a close and wide study of its laws, and institutionsmanners and customs, modes of thought and emotional proclivitiesbecomes a thing of paramount interest. It is clear, hence, that to ourrulers an acquaintance with such works as the Mahabharata andRāmāyana is most important for wise and beneficient adminstration.Nor can it avail one to advance the seemingly unanswerable objectionthat treating of as they do a state of society divided from the realpresent by a huge and abyssmal gulf of time, such works can by nomeans serve as useful and faithful guides to the life and manners ofHindu society existing at this day. \"In India,\" as Professor MonierWilliams justly remarks, \"the lapse of centuries is powerless ineffecting radical changes in the foundation and constitution of Hindusociety.\" The conservative character of the Hindu nation is proverbial.In India usages and observances, the rituals prescribed by thescriptures and the customs sanctioned by hoary age, are clung to with atenacity that is proof against time and innovation; and those who thinkthat England has materially swayed and influnced the social life of thepeople, labour, we make bold to say, under a lamentable delusion."
 },
 {
  "Bālakāndam and Ayodhyākāndam": "Having regard alike to the surpassing and matchless excellenceof the poem itself both in its dramatic and lyric character, theextreme interest it possesses for antiquaries and students of orientalliterature, and the importance with which its study is fraughtpolitically to Englishmen, it is most desirable that the Rāmāyana shouldbe presented before the public in an English garb. In consequenceof its being composed originally in Sanskrit, it literally remains asealed book to the majority of students. Few are the persons thatcan devote their time and energies to master Sanskrit—a languagewhich of all languages existing on earth, is, in consequence of itshighly complex and complicated grammar, as well as the indefinitenesswhich characterises it on account of its possessing countlesssynonyms, most difficult to master by a foreigner. Nay, we can perhapssafely go so far as to assert that very few amongst those Westernscholars who have devoted their lives to the study of Sanskrit literature,have been able to enter into the spirit of that part of its vocabularyin which are couched those peculiarly Hindu ideas and sentimentsthat constitute the unique genius of the people. To translate,therefore, such a work as the Rāmāyana from the dead and indefiniteSanskrit into the living and real English, is, like unearthening a fossiland inspiring it with life; or rather like transferring a light from abushel in which it has been hidden, to a mountain- top,—so that menmay behold it and the surrounding objects by help of its grateful rays.Surely, to render a work from a dead tongue into a living languageand specially such a language as English with all its resources, isliterally taking it from its narrow and circumscribed sphere ofinfluence, and placing it before the world at large—in fact, making itthe common property and heritage of all mankind. The utility,therefore, we flatter ourselves, of this present literary undertaking,will recomend itself to all thinking-minds without any further elaborationon our part. Indeed, it would argue no common hardihoodin him who despite common sense and reason, would endevour tomaintain that the Epic of Valmiki published in an English garb(always provided that the execution do not fall far short of therequirements) would prove valueless as a contribution to the case ofliterature and culture."
 },
 {
  "Bālakāndam and Ayodhyākāndam": "In translating the Rāmāyana into English, we are concernedwith a work composed by an illustrious ascetic passing his daysin a hermitage in devout contemplation and the practice of rigidausterities and self-denial. It behoves us, therefore, to approach thetask in a becoming spirit, with minds duly prepared and fitted. Letus, accordingly, begin by invoking Him whose presence can convertthe foulest and the most unclean spot, pure and clean, \"like the iciclethat hangs on Dian's temple,\" or the hearts and aspirations of theVestal Virgins, or pious saints ever engaged in meditating the MostHigh. May He in His infinite and eternal grace vouchsafe topurge our minds of all ignoble feelings and motives,—may He enableis to find delight in duty and doing His will! May our energiesnever flag while carrying the burden we have taken on our shoulders!May He enlighten our understanding to interpret aright and conveyin clear and adequate language the great thoughts and sentiments ofthe sublime bard,—so that the English Rāmāyana being read by allthe subjects of a Monarch on whose dominions the sun never sets, itmay contribute to their constant profit and delight."

Great is my curiosity to hear of such a person.Thou canst, O Maharshi1 tell me of a man of this description.\"Hearing Valmiki's words, Nārada, cognizant of the threeworlds, said with alacrity,—\"Do thou listen!

  "Bālakāndam and Ayodhyākāndam": "\"Desirous of doing that which would be acceptable tosubject, king Daçarātha, from fulness of affection, wished toinstal as his associate in the kingdom his beloved andmeritorious eldest son, Rāma, of infallible prowess, andendued with sterling virtues, and ever intent on the welfareof the people. Beholding the provisions for the installation,that lady the king's consort, Kaikeyi, who had previously beenpromised two boons, even asked for these, viz., the exile ofRāma, and the installation of Bharata. Bound by the ties ofduty in consequence of that promise of his, king Daçarāthabanished his favorite son Rāma. In pursuance of his father'spromise, and with the view of compassing the pleasure ofKaikeyi, that heroic one, commanded by his sire, wended intothe forest. And on the eve of his departure for the forest,that enhancer of Sumitrā's joy and favorite of his brother(Rāma), his dear brother Lakshmana, endowed with humility,displaying brotherliness, followed him out of affection. Andas Rohini followeth the moon, Rāma's beloved spouse, sprungin Janaka's line—like unto an embodiment of Divine power—dear (unto Rāma) as life itself, and engaged in acts ofgood, and furnished with every auspicious mark, and the bestof wives, followed Rāma. Having been followed far byhis father Daçarātha along with the citizens, Rāma met withthe virtuous and beloved king of the Nishādas; and then incompany with Guha, Lakshmana,and Sitā, dismissed his charioteeron the banks of the Ganges at Sringaverapura. Thenwending from one wood to another, and having crossed manybroad rivers, they, in accordance with Bharadwāja's directions,arrived at the Chitrakuta; and constructing a romantic abode,the three began to live there as they listed. And they spent theirdays in delight, even like gods and Gandharbhas. And whenRāma had reached the Chitrakuta, king Daçarātha, distressedon account of his son, went to heaven, bewailing the latter.And when Daçarātha had ascended heaven, the mightyBharata, although pressed by the Brāhmanas headed by Vasistha,to rule the kingdom, did not wish for dominion. And thathero went after Rāma into the forest, with the view ofpropitiating that worshipful one. And having come to the high-souled Rāma, with truth for his prowess, he besought hisbrother, with every mark of respect. And Rāma said untoBharata these words,—\"Thou too, O thou conversant withduty, art king.\" And the exceedingly generous, illustrious andmighty Rāma of a cheerful countenance did not wish for thekingdom, in consonance with his father's injunction. Andhaving made over unto Bharata, as his substitute on the throne,his own sandals, Bharata's elder brother repeatedly forbadehim. And then Bharata,finding his desire not obtained,touchedRāma's feet, and began to rule at Nandigrāma, expectingthe return of Rāma. And when the auspicious Bharata,firm in promise and of subdued sense, had gone away, Rāmaagain perceiving there the influx of citizens and others, eagerlyentered Dandaka. And having entered that mighty forest,the lotus-eyed Rāma slew the Rākshasa, Virādha, and sawSarabhanga, Suitikshna, Agastya and Agastya's brother. Andhe then, directed by Agastya, gladly possessed himself ofIndra's bow, the inexhaustible arrows, the scimitar, and thequiver. And while Rāma was dwelling there with the rangersof woods, the sages came to him in a body for the destructionof the Asuras and Rākshasas. Thereupon in the presenceof those ascetics like unto flaming fire, inhabiting theDandaka forest, he promised to slay those Rākshasas inbattle. And it was while he was living there that, thatdweller of Janasthāna, the Rākshasi Surpanakhā, capable ofassuming any form at will, was disfigured. And it waswhile living there in the society of the inhabitants ofJanasthāna, that Rāma slew in battle the Rākshasas Khara andTricira and Dushana, together with their followers, whoall had been stirred up by the words of Surpanakhā. Andfourteen thousand Rikshasas were slain in that battle. Andlearning of the destruction of his relatives, Rāvana wroughtinto frenzy by anger, sought the aid of a Rakshasa namedMāricha. And although strongly dissuaded by Māricha,saying\"Thou ought not to enter into hostilities with that powerfulone. Do thou, therefore, O Rāvana, excuse me!\" Yet,disregarding those words of his, Rāvana, urged on by Fate, wentinto that asylum in company with Māricha. And that one(Māricha) commanding illusions, having drawn far the king'ssons (Rāma and Lakshmana) he (Rāvana) carried away Rāma'swife, slaying the vulture Jatāyu. And beholding the vultureslain and learning of the carrying off of Mithilā's daughter,the descendant of Raghu, deprived of sense, bewailed in grief.And having with unassuaged sorrow burnt the vulture Jatayu,as he was searching for Sitā in that wood, he fell in with aRākshasa, Kāvandha by name, of a dreadful and deformedshape. Having slain him, the mighty-armed one burnt hisbody,—and thereupon he went to heaven. And the Rākshasaaddressed Rāma, saying, \"Do thou, O descendant of Raghu, repairunto the female ascetic, Savari, conversant with all systemsof morality.\" Reparing to Savari, that destroyer of foes, giftedwith exceeding energy, Rāma, the son of Daçarātha, highlyhonored by Savari, met with Hanumān on the banks of thePampā. Then, agreeably to Hanumān's advice, the exceedinglypowerful Rāma saw Sugriva and detailed unto him all,specially touching Sitā. Then the monkey Sugriva, havingheard all from Rāma, was well pleased with Rāma and in thepresence of fire, made friends with him. Then the king of monkeys,out of friendship, mournfully related unto him all abouthis hostilities with Vāli. And then Rāma vowed that he wouldslay Vāli. Thereupon the monkey described unto Rāghavathe prowess of Vāli, and he feared lest Rāma should not provea match for Vāli. And with the view of convincing Rāghava(as to Vāli's might), Sugriva showed unto him the huge corpseof Dundabhi, resembling a large hill. And looking at theskeleton, Rāma endued with exceeding prowess, smiling thewhile, with his toe cast it off at the distance of full ninetymiles. And with a single mighty shaft he pierced sevenpalmyra palms, a hill, and the sixth nether world, carryingconviction into Sugriva. Thus convinced, the mighty monkeywell pleased went with Rāma towards the cave calledKishkinda. And having arrived there, that best of monkeysSugriva of a tawney and golden hue, set up loud roars.And at those mighty sounds, out came the lord of monkeysand having obtained Tāra's consent, came before Sugrivafor battle. Then Rāghava killed Vāli on the spot with asingle shaft. And, in compliance with Sugriva's request,having slain Vāli in battle, Rāghava conferred the kingdonon Sugriva. Then that best of monkeys having summonedall the various monkeys, sent them in various directions itsearch of Janaka's daughter. Then at the suggestion of thevulture Sampāti, the mighty Hanumān crossed the salt seaextending for a hundred yojanas. And arriving at the city ofLankā, ruled by Rāvana, he found Sitā in the midst of anAsoka wood, absorbed in thought. And then having shown herthe sign, he related unto her all about the friendship betweenRāma and Sugriva, and having cheered Videha's daughter, hesmashed the gate of the palace. Then having slain five generals,and seven counsellors' sons, and grinded the heroic Aksha,he was bound fast (by the arms of Indrajit). Then knowingthat in virtue of the grand-sire's boon, he was free, he forgavethose Rākshasas that were leading him (to Rāvana). Thenhaving burnt down the city of Lankā, with the exception ofthe place occupied by Mithila's daughter, the mighty onereturned, with the intention of delivering the glad tidings untoRāma. And that one of immeasurable soul having come beforethe high souled Rāma, and circled him, addressed him,saying,—\"I have truly seen Sitā.\" Then accompanied bySugriva, Rāma repaired to the shore of the mighty ocean, andwith shafts resembling the sun, vexed the deep. Then thatlord of rivers—the Ocean—showed himself. And agreeablyto the advice of the Ocean, Nala constructed a bridge (overthe water). By that bridge Rāma went to the city ofLankā,—and slew Rāvana in battle. And having recoveredSitā, Rāma experienced high shame (in consequence ofSitā's having lived so long in Rāvana's place), and used harshlanguage towards Sitā in the presence of all. Incapable ofhearing it, the chaste Sitā entered flaming fire. Thereuponassured by Agni as to the sinlessness of Sitā, Rāma becameexceedingly pleased, and was honored by all the deities.And at the great act of Rāma's, the three worlds with allthat was mobile and immobile in them, as well as the sagesand gods, were well pleased with the mighty-souled Rāghava.Then installing that foremost of Rākshasas, Bibhisana, onthe throne of Lankā, Rāma was perfectly easy, andrejoiced exceedingly. Then Rāma, obtaining a boon from thecelestials, revived the monkeys fallen in battle, and surroundedby friends, set out for Ayodhyā on the car Pushpaka.And repairing to Bharadwāja's hermitage, Rāma, havingtruth for his prowess, despatched Hanumān to Bharata.Then talking over past affairs, accompanied with Sugriva,Rāma, mounted on the Pushpaka, departed for Nandigrama.Having arrived at Nandigrama, the sinless Rāma shearedhimself of his matted locks along with his brothers, and,laving regained Sitā, got back his kingdom. And Daçarātha'sson, the auspicious Rāma, lord of Ayodha, hath been rulingthose happy subjects of his, even like a father. (During hisreign) his subjects will enjoy happiness, and contentment,and become hale, and grow in righteousness, and be devoid ofmental disquietude and disease, and free from the fear offamine. And no person is to witness his son's death, andwomen will be ever chaste, and never bear widowhood. Andno fear of conflagration (will exercise people), nor creaturesbe drowned in water. And no danger will come from the wind,—nor any suffer from fever. And no fear will come from hunger,Or from thieves. And cities and provinces will be filled withcorn and wealth. And all will live happily as at the Golden age,And having performed with countless gold an hundredhorse sacrifices, and bestowed with due rites ayutas andkotis2 of kine on learned persons, and countless wealthon famous Brāhmanas, Rāghava will establish an hundred royalfamilies, and will employ each of the four castes in its ownduties. And having reigned for ten thousand and as manyhundred years, Rāma will depart for the regions of Brahā.He that readeth this sacred, sin-destroying, merit-bestowinghistory of Rāma like unto the Veda itself, becometh cleansedfrom all sin. And the man that readeth this Rāmāyanaconferring length of days, after death, is honored in heaven,along with his sons, and grandsons, and relations. If aBrāhmana readeth it, he attaineth excellence in speech; if aKshatriya, he acquireth lordship over landed possessions;if a Vaisya, abundance of wealth in trade; and if a Sudra,greatness.\""

And having received due honors, thecelestial asking for and receiving permission (to depart),went to the etherial regions. And when Nārada had leftfor the celestial regions, that holy person went to the banksof the Tamasā hard by the Jahnavi. And having arrivedat the banks of that river, the pious one, observing aholy spot devoid of mud, spoke into his disciple standing by,saying,—\"O Bharadwiya, behold this holy spot devoid ofmud. And it is beautiful, and contains pleasant waters, evenlike the minds of good men. Do thou, child, put down thypitcher, and give me my bark. I will bathe even in thisTamasā, the best of holy spots.\" Thus accosted by the high-souled Vālmiki, Bharadwāja ever intent upon serving hisspiritual guide, presented the sage his bark. And that oneof subdued senses, having received his bark from his disciple,began to range around, surveying that extensive forest. Inthe vicinity of the wood, that worshipful one espied a pair ofKraunchas, emitting melodious notes, and ranging around inperfect peace of mind. At this juncture, a wicked-mindedfowler, singling out the male without any cause ofhostility, slew him in the very presence of the holy man. Andobserving him struggling on the earth, bathed in blood hishelp-mate began to bewail in piteous accents, at the prospectof her separation from her copper-crested oviparous husband,engaged in sport with extended plumage. Finding theoviparous one thus brought down by the fowler, the pietyof that pious and righteous-souled Rishi was excited exceedingly.Then considering it to be an unrighteous deed, witha heart moved with pity, that twice-born one, beholdingthe weeping Kraunchi, spoke these words,—\"O fowler,since thou hast slain one of a pair of Kraunchas, thou shaltnever attain prosperity!\" Having uttered this, he thoughtwithin himself, \"What is this that I have said, afflicted withgrief for the bird?\" Revolving thus in his mind, thathighly-wise one and best of sages addressed his disciple,saying,—\"This speech that I have uttered is of equal feetand accents; and is capable of being chaunted accordingto measure to stringed accompaniment. Let it thereforego forth as a sloka as it has come out of my sorrow!\"When the sage had spoken thus, his disciple, well pleased,assented to his excellent speech; and thereat that piousperson was gratified. Then having duly performed hisablutions at that holy spot, the reverend sage retracedhis steps, pondering over the incidents touching the sloka.And his disciple also, accomplished in learning, and of Imeek demeanour, followed Valmiki, carrying on his backa pitcher filled with water."

And it came to pass that desirousof seeing the best of sages, there arrived that lord andcreator of all, the effulgent Brahmā, furnished with fourcountenances. Beholding him, Vālmiki rose up suddenlyand, wondering greatly, humbly and silently stood beforehim with folded hands. And duly bending low in reverenceVālmiki offered that deity water to wash his feet, andother things for reception. And having sat down on ahighly-honored seat, that worshipful one enquired after thewelfare of that sage Vālmiki knowing no deterioration; andthen asked him to be seated. And having been seated inthe presence of the Grand-sire of all, Vālmiki, his mindrunning upon the self-same subject, became plunged in thought.\"What a sin hath been committed by that wicked-mindedone, incited by hostile feeling, when he without cause slewthat sweetly-singing Krauncha!\" And thereupon, againlamenting that female Krauncha, he, in grief of heart,mentally recited those verses. Then smiling, Brahmft spokeunto that excellent sage,—\"Those verses of thine which thouhast composed shall attain celebrity: no doubt need beentertained on this head. It is because I had intended so, thatthose verses had come out of thy lips. Do thou now, Obest of saints, compose the entire history of Rāma. Dothou relate unto the world the history of the righteous-souledand intelligent Rāma crowned with qualities. And do thou,and thou hast heard it from Nārada, relate all that is known,and all that is unknown to thee, O wise one, concerningRāma, and Lakshmana, and Videha's daughter, and all theRākshasas. And even what is not known to Nārada, shallbe unfolded unto thee. And no words of thine in this poemshall contain an untruth. Do thou, therefore, compose intoverses this delightful story of Rāma. And as long as themountains and the seas exist on earth, thy history of Rāmāyanawill spread among men. And as long as this story ofRāmāyana shall retain currency, thou shalt reside both inthis world and in mine.\" Having said this, the worshipfulBrahmā disappeared there. And thereat the sage and hisdisciples marvelled greatly. And his disciples sang thoseverses again and again; and, momentarily experiencingpleasure, said unto him with exceeding wonder,—\"Thoseverses, composed of equal accents, and furnished with fourparts, have been sung by the mighty saint, have, in virtue offrequent repetition, been associated with a world of pathos,and have attained the eminence of a sloka. And now it is theintention of that illustrious and self centered sage to composethe entire Rāmāyana in this metre.\""

Thereupon, hearingthose words of theirs capable of influencing the heart,he became bent upon going,—and the women brought himaway. And when that high-souled Vipra had been broughtover, the good, Indra, suddenly poured forth plenteousshowers, enlivening the spirits of men. And when the ascetichad arrived, with showers, the king approached him inhumble guise, bending his head to the ground. And heoffered him Arghya,in due form, and with a collected mind;and asked for his favor, so that wrath could not influencethe Vipra. And taking him into the inner apartments, andin due form conferring upon him in sober mood hisdaughter Sāntā, the king became happy. Thus the highlypowerful Rishyasringa together with his wife Sāntā, beganto live there, respectfully ministered unto in regard to everydesire.\""

And with Rhishyasringaat their head, the principal twice born ones began theproceedings in that mighty horse-sacrifice of that high-souledmonarch. And the priests, each duly and according tothe ordinance performing his proper part, engaged in theceremony in consonance with the scriptures. And theregenerate ones, having performed the pravargya as wellas the upasada according to the ordinance, duly completedthe additional ceremonies. Then, worshipping the deitieswith glad hearts, those foremost of ascetics duly performedthe morning ablutions and the other prescribed rites.The oblations of clarified butter first having been offeredunto Indra, according to the ritual, the king with apurified heart performed his ablutions. And then the mid-dayablutions took place in proper sequence. And those foremostof Brāhmanas, in due form, and according to the ordinance,officiated at the third bath of that high-souled monarch.And the priests presided over by Rhishyasringa, invokedSakra and the other deities, reciting measured mantras.And the sacrificial priests, chaunting sweet Sâmas and softmantras, duly invoking the dwellers of the celestial regions,offered each his share of the oblations. And no partof the ceremony was performed improperly, or left out,—and every thing was satisfactorily celebrated with mantras.And on that day no Brāhmana ever felt tired, or hungry;and there was none that was not learned, or that was notfollowed by an hundred persons. And Brāhmanas, andSudras having among them ascetics, and Sramanas, and theaged, and the infirm, and women, and children, werecontinually fed. And although they ate their fill, yet theyknew no repletion. And \"Give food, and clothes of variouskind\"—(was heard all around). And those employedin the task gave away profusely. And every day fooddressed properly in due form was to be seen in countlessheaps resembling hills. And men and women coming fromvarious countries to the sacrifice of that high-souled onewere excellently entertained with meats and drinks. Andthe foremost regenerate ones said,—\"The viands have beenprepared in the prescribed form, and they taste excellent.We have been gratified. Good betide thee!\" All this washeard by that descendant of Raghu. And persons adornedwith ornaments distributed the victuals among the Brāhmanas,and they were assisted by others beaming jewelledpendants. And in the interval between the completion ofone bath and the beginning of the next, mild and eloquentVipras, desirous of victory, engaged in various disputations.And every day in that sacrifice, skilful Brāhmanas, engagedin the ceremony, did every thing, according to the ritual.And there was no twice-born one that was not versed in theVedas and the Vedāngas, or that did not observe vows, orthat was not profoundly learned,—nor did any assist at thesacrifice that could not argue ably. And when the time camefor planting the Yupas, persons cognizant of arts andsacrificial rites, prepared six Yupas of Vilwa, as many of catechu,and as many of Palasa, and one of Sleshmataka, and two ofDevadaru well-made and measuring two outstretched arms.Persons versed in the arts and science of sacrifice constructedthese Yupas. And at the time of throwing up the Yupas,for embellishing the sacrifice, these one and twenty Yupas,each measuring one and twenty Aratnis, having eightangles, and smooth-faced were decked out in one and twentypieces of cloth, and were firmly planted with due ceremoniesby artizans. And being wrapped up in cloths, and worshippedwith flowers, they looked like the seven Rishis appearingin the welkin. And an adequate number of bricks wasalso duly made (for the ceremony.) And Brāhmanasaccomplished in the arts constructed the sacrificial fire-place withthose bricks. And that fire-place of that lion among kings,set by skilful Brāhmanas, consisting on three sides of eighteenbricks, looked like the golden-winged Garura. And forthe purpose of sacrificing them unto the respective deities werecollected beasts and reptiles, and birds, and horses, andaquatic animals. And the priests sacrificed all these in properform. And to these Yupas were bound three hundredbeasts, as well as the foremost of the best horses belongingto king Daçarātha. Then Kaucalyā, having performed thepreliminary rites, with three strokes slew that horse, experiencinggreat glee. And with the view of reaping meritKaucalyā, with an undisturbed heart passed one night withthat horse furnished with wings. And the Hotâs andAdhwaryus, and the Uâgatas joined the king's Vâvâtâalong with his Mahishi and Parivriti15 And priests ofsubdued senses, well-up in sacrificial rites, began to offeroblations with the fat of the winged-horse, according to theordinance. And that lord of men, desirous of removing hissins, at the proper time smelt the odour of the smoke arisingfrom the fat, agreeably to the scriptures. And then sixteensacrificial priests in the prescribed form offered the various partsof the horse unto the fire. It is customary in other sacrificesto offer the oblations by means of a Plaksha bough; but inthe horse-sacrifice a cane is used instead. The horse-sacrifice,according to the Kalpa Sutras and the Brāhmanas,extend over three days. There after, on the first day was theChatushtoma celebrated; and on the second the Uktha,—and on the third the Atiratra. And then the Jyotishtoma,and then Ayushtoma, and the Atiratra and theAbhijit, and the Viswajit, and the Aptoryama—all thesevarious great sacrifices were celebrated with due rites. And inthis mighty horse-sacrifice founded of yore by Sayambhu, thatperpetuator of his line, the king, bestowed the Easternquarter on his chief sacrificial priest, the Western on hisAdhwaryu, the Southern on Brahmā, and the Northern onthe Udgath, as Dakshinas. And having completed thatsacrifice, that perpetuator of his race, and foremost of men,the king, conferred on the priests the earth; and havingconferred it, that auspicious descendant of Iskhāku experiencedhigh delight. And then the priests spoke unto that monarch,who had all his sins purged off, saying,—\"Thou alone artworthy to protect the entire world. We do not want theearth; nor can we rule it, being, O lord of Earth, constantlyengaged in Vaidika studies. Do thou, therefore, conferupon us something instead, as the price thereof. Do thouconfer upon us gems, or gold, or kine, or anything else, for,O foremost of monarchs, we do not want Earth.\" Thusaddressed by the Brāhmanas versed in the Veda, that bestof kings bestowed upon them ten lacs of kine, and ten Kotisof gold, and forty of silver. Then those priests in a body,accepting the wealth, brought it unto the ascetic Rhishyasringaand the intelligent Vasishtha. Then having receieivedeach his share, those foremost of regenerate ones wereexceedingly pleased, and said,—\"We have been highlygratified.\" Then unto those Brāhmanas that had come there,the king with due regard gave Kotis of gold. Andunto a certain poor twice-born one that asked for gifts, thedescendant of Raghu gave an excellent ornament from hisown arm. And, when the regenerate ones were thus properlygratified, that one cherishing the Brāhmanas, with sensesintoxicated by excess of joy, reverentially bowed unto them.And thereupon the Brāhmanas uttered various blessings uponthat generous king, bending low to the earth. Then havingcelebrated that excellent and sin-destroying sacrifice, bringingheaven, and incapable of being celebrated by foremostmonarchs, king Daçarātha, well pleased, spoke unto Rhisyasinga,saying,—\"0 thou of excellent vows, it behoveth thee todo that whereby my line may increase.\" Thereupon thebest of Brāhmanas said,—\"Be it so! Unto thee, O king, willbe born four sons,—perpetuators of their race.\" Hearingthese sweet words of his, that foremost of monarchs bendedlow unto him with controlled faculties, and experienced theexcess of joy. And then that high-souled one again spokeunto Rhishyasringa."

And thedeities, with the Gandharbas, and the Siddhas, and theprincipal saints, assembled there duly, with the object ofeach obtaining his share of the offerings. And havingduly assembled there, the deities addressed these words untoBrahmā, the lord of creatures,—\"O thou possessed of the sixattributes, through thy grace, a Rākshasa named Rāvanaoppresses us all by his prowess,—nor can we baffle him.And, O lord, as thou hast well-pleased conferred on him aboon, we always suffer him in deference to it.

He hadasked,—'May I be incapable of being slain by Gandharbas,and Yakshas, and gods, and Rākshasas!'—whereat I said,—'Be it so!' Through disdain, the Rākshasa did not at thattime mention men. Therefore, by men alone he is capable ofbeing slain; nor can his end be compassed by any othermeans.\" Hearing this welcome speech uttered by Brahmā,the deities and the Maharshis became exceedingly delighted.At this juncture, that lord of the universe, the highly-effulgent Vishnu, clad in yellow apparel, and bearing in his handsthe conch, the discus, and the mace, and adorned withburnished Keyuras16 arrived there, riding Vinatā's son; likethe Sun riding the clouds.

And by him bereft of the sense of right and wrong,have saints and Gandharbas and Apsarās sporting in thegroves of Nandana, been wantonly slain.

  "Bālakāndam and Ayodhyākāndam": "When Vishnu had accepted the sonship of that high-souled king, the self-create Lord addressed the celestials,saying,—\"For assisting the heroic Vishnu firm in promise,always seeking the welfare of us all, do ye create powerfulbeings, assuming shapes at will, cognizant of illusions, heroic,furnished with the celerity of the wind, versed in morality,possessing intelligence, like unto Vishnu in prowess, unslayable,knowing the ways and means (of war and peace) giftedwith excellent bodies, capable of resisting all weapons, andresembling immortals. And from forth the bodies of theforemost Apsaris, and Gandharbis, and Yakskis, andPanagis, and Rikshis20 and Vidhyddharis, and Kinnaris, andVanaris21 do ye produce sons wearing the shapes of monkeys.Formerly I had created that foremost of bears, Jāmbuvāna,who suddenly came out of my mouth as I was yawning.\"Hearing this mandate of Him possessed of the six attributes,they began to produce sons endowed with monkey-forms. And high-souled ascetics, and Siddhas, andVidhādharas, and Uragas, and Chāranas, generated heroic sons,—rangers of woods. And Indra begat as his son that foremostof monkeys, Vāli, resembling the Mahendra hill, andthat best of those imparting heat, the Sun, Sugriva.And Vrihaspati begat the mighty ape named Tārā, the mostexcellent and intelligent of the prime monkeys. Andthe Bestower of riches begat as his son the graceful apeGandhamādana. And Vicwakarma begat that mightymonkey named Nala; and Agni begat as his son the powerfuland graceful Nila in effulgence like unto the fire, whosurpassed even his sire in energy, prowess, and renown.And the beautiful Acwins, endowed with the wealth ofloveliness, begat Maindra and Dwivida. And Varuna begatthe monkey named Sushena; and Paryyanya begat Sarava,possessed of great strength. And the Wind god begatthe graceful monkey named Hanumān, endeued with a framehard as adamant; in fleetness like unto Vinatā's offspring; andthe most intelligent as well as the most powerful amongst allthe principal monkeys. Thus produced, there suddenly cameinto being by thousands, mighty bears, and monkeys, andGopuchchhas,22 of immeasurable strength, and heroic, andpowerful, assuming shapes at will, endowed with bodiesresembling elephants of hills,—even those who would engagein compassing the destruction of the Ten-headed one. Andthe sons of the deities retained distinctly the respectivehues, forms, and prowess, that characterized their severalsires. And those that sprang from the Golangulas,23 possessedeven more than the might of the gods. Likewise, onRikshis and Kinnaris were gladly begot thousands uponthousands of monkeys, by gods, and Maharshis, andGandarbas, and Tarkshyas, and famous Yakshas, andNagās, and Kimpurushas,24 and Siddhas and Vidyādharas,and Uragas. And upon the principal Apsaris, and theVidyādharis, and the daughters of the Nāgas, and theGandarbis were begot by the Chāranas as sons, heroic monkeysof gigantic bodies, ranging the forests and living on fruitsand roots. And all these monkeys were endowed withstrength; and could assume shapes and repair everywhere,at will. And they were like unto lions and tigers, both inpride and in prowess. And they faught with crags and hurledhills. And they faught with nails and teeth,—and were accomplishedin all weapons. And they could move the largesthills; and crush the fixed trees; and with their impetus, vexthat lord of rivers—the Ocean. And they could with theirkicks rend the Earth, and swim over the mighty main. Andthey could penetrate into the welkin,—and capture theclouds. And they could subdue mad elephants ranging theforest. And with their roars, they could bring down birdssinging. Thus came into being Kotis of high-souled leadersof monkey-herds, assuming forms at will. And these becamethe leaders of the principal monkey-herds; and they, in theirturn, generated heroic monkeys, the foremost of the leadersof herds."

  "Bālakāndam and Ayodhyākāndam": "Some of these monkeys began to dwell on the top ofthe Rikshavāna mountain; while others inhabited variousother mountains and forests. And all the leaders of monkey-herds stayed with those brothers,—Sugriva, the son of theSun-god and Vali, that of Sakra,—and also with Nala, andNila, and Hanumān, and other leaders of monkey-herds. Andendowed with the might of Garura, and accomplished in fight,they ranged around, pounding lions, and tigers, and mightyUragas. And the mighty-armed Vali of great prowess andredoubtable strength protected by virtue of the energy ofhis arms Rikshas, and Gopuchchhas, and monkeys. Andthis earth, furnished with mountains, and forests, and oceans,began to teem with those heroic lords of leaders of monkey-herds, inhabiting different places, bearing characteristicmarks, resembling masses of clouds, or mountain-peaks,possessed of mighty strength, and of terrible bodies andvisages,—in order that they might assist Rāma."

And the monarch,having observed all the rules of initiation, entered thepalace with his equipage and retinue. And the lords ofthe earth, having been received suitably by the king, withglad hearts set out for their own countries, saluting thatforemost of ascetics (Rhishyasringa). And clad in brightapparel, the delighted forces belonging to those gracefulkings repairing to their own homes, looked exceedinglybeautiful. When the lords of the earth had gone away, thegraceful king Daçarātha re-entered his palace, with theforemost of regenerate ones at his head.

Then on having given birth to that sonof immeasurable prowess, Kaucalyā looked resplendent, likeAditi on having brought forth that foremost of celestials—thewielder of the thunder-bolt. And then was born of Kaikeyi,Bharata, having truth for prowess, endowed with all thevirtues, and the very fourth part of Vishnu. And thenSumitrā gave birth unto Lakshmana and Satrughna, heroic,and skilled in all weapons, and endowed with the half ofVishnu. And Bharata of purged intelligence was born underthe asterism Pushyā, when the Sun had entered Pisces; whilethe two sons of Sumitrā were born when the Sun arose inCancer, under the asterism of Asleshā.25"

And the celestial kettledrums sounded;and there showered down blossoms from the sky. And highfestivities were commenced by the multitude in Ayodhyā.And the spacious highways became filled with players anddancers, glittering with all kinds of gems, and resoundingwith the music of singers and performers on instruments.And the king bestowed gifts upon bards and genealogistsand penegyrists, and he also gave kine by thousands toBrāhmanas."

And the high-souled eldest one was called Rāma; and Kaikeyi's son wascalled Bharata; and Sumitrā's son was called Lakshmana,—and the last was named Satrughna. And the king fed theBrāhmanas as well as the inhabitants rural and urban; andhe bestowed heaps of jewels upon Brāhmanas. Thus didhe celebrate the natal rites of the princes. And among allthose princes, the eldest, Rāma, like unto Ketu,27 and thespecial delight of his father, became the object of generalregard, even as the self-create Himself. And all of them wereversed in the Vedas, and heroic, and intent upon the welfareof others. And all were accomplished in knowledge; andendowed with virtues. And among them all, the exceedinglypuissant Rāma, having truth for prowess, was the desireof every one, and spotless like unto the Moon himself.28He could ride on elephants and horses, and was an adeptin managing cars. And he was ever engaged in the studyof arms, and aye occupied in ministering unto his sire. Andeven from early youth, that enhancer of auspiciousness,Lakshmana, was ever attached unto his eldest brother Rāma,that delight of all. And like unto another life of Rāma,Lakshmana furnished with auspiciousness was in everythingattentive to Rāma's wishes, even at the neglect of his ownperson. And that foremost of persons did not even attainsleep without Rāma's company,—nor did he partake anysweetmeat that was offered, unless Rāma partook it with him.And when mounted on horse-back, Rāghava went a-hunting,Lakshmana went at his back bow in hand, protecting him.And that younger brother of Lakshmana, Satrughna, likewisebecame ever dearer unto Bharata than life itself."

And desirous of seeing the king, hesaid unto the warders,—\"Do ye speedily announce that I,Gadhi's son, sprung in the Kuçika line, have come!\" Hearingthose words of his, they urged on by them, all hurriedlybegan to run towards the royal chambers. And coming tothe royal apartments, they communicated to Ikshwāku'sdescendant the arrival of the ascetic Viswāmitra. Hearingthose words of theirs, Daçarātha surrounded by his priests,went out delightedly to meet him, like Vāsava going out tomeet Vrihashpati.29 And having come unto that asceticobserving vows and of flaming energy, the monarch with acheerful countenance offered him the Arghya. And there-upon, having accepted the king's Arghya in accordancewith the ordinance, he enquired of the lord of men as to hiscontinued prosperity and peace. And the exceedingly virtuousdescendant of Kuçika asked the king concerning thewelfare of the exchequer, and the provinces; and the peaceof his friends and acquaintances. \"And are thy captainssubmissive: and hast thou vanquished thy foes? And hast thouperformed well the human and the divine rites?\" Andapproaching Vasishtha and the other anchorites, that foremostof ascetics of exalted piety duly asked them touching theirwelfare. And having been properly received by the monarch,they with glad hearts entered the royal residence, and satthem down according to precedence. Then gladly worshippingthe mighty ascetic, Viswāmitra, the exceedingly generous king,well-pleased, addressed him, saying,—\"Like unto the obtainingof ambrosia, like unto a shower in a land suffering fromdrouth, like unto the birth of sons of worthy wives to himwithout issue, like unto the recovery of a lost thing, yea,—likeunto the dawning of a mighty joy, I consider this thy arrival.illustrious ascetic, thou art well come. What is eventhat which is nearest to thy heart. What shall I do for thee,experiencing sincere pleasure? Thou, O Brāhmana, artworthy of my best services.

Having first attainedexceeding effulgence by virtue of austerities performedfor obtaining the title of Rājarshi, thou hast afterwardsobtained the status of a Brahmārshi. Thou art worthy ofmanifold homage from me. This thy exceedingly holy arrivalappeareth wonderful. O lord, by beholding thee, surely mybody hath been rendered pure. Tell me, what is it thatthou wouldst have,—and what is the purpose of thy coming?I wish that I may be obliged by doing thy will. And, Othou of excellent vows, thou ought not to hesitate. I willevery way accomplish thy will for thou art my god.O regnerate one, surely great prosperity cometh to me inconsequence of thy coming, in as much as it shall be themeans of bringing me entire and excellent merit, OBrāhmana!\" Hearing this soul-soothing, ear-charming, andfree-humble speech that was uttered, that illustrious primeof ascetics crowned with virtues, and furnished with allperfections, experienced exceeding delight."

Do thou, O best ofkings, ascertain thy course in respect of the matter I bearin my heart; and do thou prove firm in promise! Forcelebrating a sacrifice, I, O foremost of men, abide by someprescribed course. And it comes to pass that two Rākshasasassuming shapes at will, have become bent upon disturbingthe ceremony. And in that sacrifice which I have determinedto bring to a completion, and which is on the eve of beingcompleted, both these Rākshasas, Maricha and Suvihu,accomplished in arms and possessed of prowess, shower fleshand gore upon the altar. And on that ceremony beingthus disturbed and my purpose thus frustrated, I consideredmy labors as all lost, and, therefore, have left my countryin dejection. And, O monarch, I cannot bring myself tovent my wrath; for such is the nature of that business, thatit is not proper for one engaged in it to utter a curse.Therefore, O foremost of monarchs, it behoves thee to grant methy eldest son, the heroic Rāma of genuine prowess, withthe side-locks. By virtue of his own divine energy, he, beingprotected by me, is capable of even destroying those Rākshasasdisturbing the ceremony. And I will, without doubt,conferupon him manifold blessings,—by means of which he willsecure the golden opinions of the three worlds. Andencountering Rāma,they will by no means be able to stand him,nor is there any other who dares to slay them. And puffedup with energy, they have become ensnared at the hands ofKāla,30 —and, O best of monarchs, they are no match forRāma. Nor, king, ought thou to indulge in paternalaffection. For ten nights only Rāma is to remain there, withthe object of slaying those foes to my sacrifice, thoseRākshasas disturbing the rites. I tell thee, do thou considerthe Rākshasas as already slain. I know full well Rāma ofsterling prowess,—as also the highly-energetic Vasishtha andthe other ascetics present here.

Therefore, do thou, O thouversed in morality, extend thy favor unto my son! Of slenderfortune as I am, thou art my guide and my god.

And how can I, O Brāhmana,make over unto thee my son, of tender years, resembling animmortal, who is ignorant of warfare? I will not part withmy son. The sons of Sunda and Upasunda resemble Kālahimself in battle,—and it is they who are disturbing thysacrifice. Therefore I will not part with my son.

O Kākuthstha'sdescendant false in promise, do thou attain happiness, beingsurrounded by thy friends.\" And when the intelligentViçwāmitra was exercised with wrath, the entire earth beganto tremble, and the gods even were inspired with awe.And knowing that the entire universe was in trepidation,that mighty saint, the sedate Vasishtha of excellent vows, saidthese words unto the king,—\"Born in the line of Ikshwāku,thou art the very second self of virtue. And endowedwith patience, and auspicious, and observing excellentvows, thou ought not to renounce virtue. The descendant ofRaghu is famed over the three worlds as righteous-souled. Dothou maintain thy habit of adhering to promise; for it dothnot behove thee to act unrighteously. If having promised,—'Iwill do so,' thou dost not act up to thy word, the merit thou hastachieved by digging tanks and by performing sacrifices shallcome to naught,—therefore do thou renounce Rāma!Accomplished or not accomplished in weapons, the Rākshasascannot bear him protected by Kuçika's son, like ambrosia,by flaming fire.

This one surpassethall others in learning, and is the refuge of asceticism.This one is cognizant of all the weapons that exist in thethree worlds furnished with mobile and imobile things; butothers do not know him,—nor yet shall know him hereafter.And neither the gods, nor the saints, nor the immortals, northe Rākshasas, nor the foremost of Gandharbas and Yakshas,nor the Kinnaras, nor the mighty Serpents can know him.And formerly while the descendant of Kuçika was rulingbis kingdom, Sivā conferred upon him the highly famous sonsof Kricācwa in the shape of all weapons. And those sons ofKricācwa were the offspring of Prajāpati's daughters. Theywere endowed with various forms, and were effulgent anddreadful. And Daksha's daughters of elegant waists, Jayā andSuprabhā, brought forth an hundred exceedingly effulgentweapons. And by virtue of her boon, Jayā obtained fifty sonsof immeasurable strength and endued with the power ofbecoming invisible for the purpose of slaughtering the hostsof the Asuras.

And that one knowing duty is alsocapable of creating wonderful weapons. And, O descendantof Raghu, there is nothing present, past, or future which is notknown by that foremost of ascetics of high soul, and cognizantof morality. Such is the prowess of that highly famousViçwāmitra possessed of mighty energy. Therefore, O king,it behoveth thee not to hesitate in the matter of Rāma's going.The descendant of Kuçika is himself capable of repressingthe Rākshasas; and it is in order to thy son's welfare thatcoming unto thee, he asketh for him of thee.\" At this speechof the ascetic, that foremost of Raghus, the king, well-pleased, became exceedingly delighted.

And, O sinless one,when thou hast secured these two kinds of knowledge,none in this world will equal thee in good fortune, or in talent,or in philosophic wisdom or in subtle apprehension, or inthe capacity of answering a controversialist; for Valā andAtivalā are the nurses of all knowledge. And, O Rāma, Oforemost of men, if thou recitest Valā and Ativalā on the way.neither hunger nor thirst will exercise thee, O descendant ofRaghu!

May thy journey be auspicious: let no delayoccur!\" Thereupon saying,—\"So be it!\", and having paidhomage unto those ascetics, Viçwāmitra set about crossingthat river with them, which had replenished the ocean.38 Andit came to pass that while thus engaged, they heard a soundaugmented by the dashing of the waves.39 And having cometo the middle of the stream, the highly energetic Rāmawith his younger brother, became curious to ascertain thecause of that sound. And reaching the middle of the river,Rāma asked that best of ascetics,—\"What is this louduproar that seemeth to come riving the water?\" HearingRāghava's words dictated by curiosity, that righteous-souledone spake, unfolding the true cause of the noise,—\"ORāma, there is in the Kailāca mountain an exceedinglybeautiful pool, created mentally by Brahmā, O foremost ofmen,—and hence this watery expanse goeth by the name ofMānasa Pool, And the stream that issues from that liquidlapse, flows through Ayodhyā: the sacred Sarayu issuesfrom that pool of Brahmā. And as the Sarayu meets theJāhnavi, this tremendous uproar is heard, being produced bythe clashing of the waters. Do thou, O Rāma, bow downto them with a concentrated mind.\" Thereupon, both ofthese exceedingly righteous ones, bowed down unto thosestreams; and betaking themselves to the right bank, beganto proceed with fleet vigour. And beholding a dreadfultrackless forest, that son of the foremost of men,Ikshhwaku's descendant, asked that best of ascetics, saying,—\"Ah! deep is this forest abounding in crickets; andfilled with terrible ferocious beasts,and various birdspossessed of shocking voices and screaming frightfully; and gracedby lions, and tigers, and boars, and elephants; and crowdedwith Dhavas40 and Acwas and Karnas41 and Kukubhas andVilmas42 and Tindukas43 and Patalas44 and Badaris.45 Whenceis this dreadful forest?\" Him answered thus the mightyasetic Viçwāmitra endowed with high energy,—\"Do thoulisten, O Kākutshtha, as to whom belongeth this dreadfulforest! Here were formerly, O foremost of men, twoflourishing provinces, named Malada, and Karusha, built bycelestial architects. In days of yore, O Rāma, on theoccasion of the destruction of Vritra, the thousand-eyed onecame to have hunger, to be besmeared with excreta, andto slay a Brāhmana. And when Indra had been thusbesmeared, the deities, and the saints having asceticism forwealth, washed him here, and cleansed his person from thedirt. And the deities, having renounced here the filth thathad clung unto the person of the mighty Indra, as well ashis hunger, attained exceeding delight. And thereat Indrabecoming purified, attained his former brightness, and becamedevoid of hunger. And mightily pleased with this region, heconferred on it an excellent boon, saying,—\"Since these twoplaces have held excreta from my body, they going by thenames of Malada and Karusha, shall attain exceedingprosperity and fame among men.\" And beholding the land thushonored by the intelligent Sacra, the deities said unto thesubduer of Pāka,—'Well!\" \"Well!\" And, O repressor offoes, these two places, Malada and Karusha, enjoyed prosperityfor a long lime and were blessed with corn and wealth.Then after a space of time, was born a Yakshini capable ofassuming forms at will, and endowed with the strength of athousand elephants. Her name, good betide thee! was Tārakā,and she was the spouse of the intelligent Sunda—she whose sonis the Rākshasa, Māricha possessed of the prowess of Sacra;having round arms, with a huge head, a capacious mouth anda cyclopean body. And that Rakshasa of dreadful form dailyfrightens people. And, O descendant of Raghu, Tārakā ofwicked deeds, daily commits havoc upon these countries,Malada and Karusha . And now at the distance of over halfa Yojana, she stayeth, obstructing the way. And since thisforest belongeth unto Tārakā, thou shouldst repair thitherand, resorting to the might of thy own arms, slay this oneof wicked deeds. And by my direction, do thou again ridthis region of its thorn; for no one dareth to approach sucha place, infested, O Rāma, by the dreadful and unbearableYakshini.

Howcan then that one of the weaker sex possess the strengthof a thousand elephants?\" Hearing this speech that wasuttered by Rāghava of immeasurable energy, Viçwāmitra,delighting with his amiable words that subduer of foes, Rāma,and Lakshmana, said,—\"Do thou listen as to the meanswhereby attaining terrible strength, that one belonging tothe weaker sex hath come to possess strength and prowessby virtue of a boon. In former times there was a mightyand exceedingly powerful Yaksha, named Suketu. And hehad no issue. And he was of pure practices, and used toperform rigid austerities. And, O Rāma, the Grand-sire,well pleased with that lord of Yakshas, conferred upon hima gem of a daughter, by name Tārakā. And the Grand-sireendowed her with the strength of a thousand elephants; yetthat illustrious one did not bestow a son on that Yaksha. Andwhen she had grown, and attained youth and beauty, hegave that famous damsel unto Jambha's son, Sunda, for wife.And after a length of time, that Yakshi gave birth to a son,named Māricha, possessed of irrepressible energy—himwho became a Rākshasa in consequence of a curse. And, ORāma, when Sunda had been destroyed, Tārakā along withher son, set her heart upon afflicting that excellentsaint Agastya. And enraged with Agastya, she rushed athim with a roar, intending to devour him. And on seeingher thus rushing, that worshipful saint, Agastya, said untoMāricha, \"Do thou become a Rākshasa!\", and, in exceedingwrath, he also cursed Tārakā. \"And, O mighty Yakshi,ince in frightful guise with a frightful face thou hast desiredto eat up a human being, do thou immediately leave this(thy original) shape, and become of a terrible form!\"Thus cursed by Agastya, Tārakā, overwhelmed with rage,lays waste this fair region, where Agastya carrieth on hisausterities.

Nor, O son ofRaghu, doth any one in the three worlds, save, thee, dare toslay this Yakshi joined with a curse. Nor shouldst thou,best of men, shrink from slaying a woman; for even thisshould be accomplished by a prince in the interests of thefour orders.

Of those engaged in the oneroustask of government, even this is the eternal rule ofconduct. Do thou, O Kukutstha, slay this impious one;for she knoweth no righteousness! We hear, O king,that in days of yore, Sakra slew Virochana's daughter,Mantharā, who had intented to distroy the earth. Andformerly, O Rāma, Vishnu destroyed Kāvya's mother, thedevoted wife of Bhrigu, who had set her heart upon makingthe world, devoid of Indra.

This, O Rāma, was formerly thehermitage of the high-souled Vāmana. And this is famed asSiddhāçrama, in consequence of that one of potent asceticismhaving attained fruition there. And it came to pass that atthis time Virochana's son, king Vāli, having vanquishedthe celestials with Indra and the Maruts, established thatdominion of his, famous in the three worlds.

That rare bow, O foremost of men,furnished with an excellent device for griping it, had beensolicited by Mithilā's lord as the fruit of his sacrifice; and thecelestials conferred it upon him. And now, O descendantof Raghu, in the residence of king, the bow is worshippedlike a deity with aguru, dhupa, and various otherincenses.\" This having been said, that foremost of ascetics,in company with Kākutstha and the saints, departed. Andon the eve of setting out, he addressed the sylvan deities,saying,—\"Luck! I will, with my desire obtained, gofrom forth this Siddhāçrama unto the Himavat mountain onthe north of the Jāhnavi.\" Having said this, that tiger-likeascetic, Kuçika's son, along with other anchorets havingasceticism for their wealth, set out in a northerly direction.And as that best of ascetics proceeded, he was followed byBrāhmanas upholding the Veda, carrying the sacrificialnecessaries on an hundred cars. And birds and beasts dwelling inSiddhāçrama followed the high-souled Viçwāmitra havingasceticism for wealth. And then followed by the body of devoteeshe dismissed the birds. And having proceded a longway, whenthe sun was sloping down, the ascetics rested on the banks ofthe Sona. And when the maker of day had set, having bathedand offered oblations unto the fire, those ascetics of immeasurableenergy, placing Viçwāmitra in their front, sat them down.And Rāma also together with Sumitrā's son, having paidhomage unto those ascetics, sat him down before the intelligentViçwāmitra. Then Rāma of exceeding energy,influenced by curiosity, asked that foremost of ascetics,Viçwāmitra, having asceticism for his wealth, saying,—\"Oworshipful one, what country is this, graced with luxuriantwoods? I am desirous of hearing this. Good betide thee,it behoveth thee to tell me this truly.\" Thus addressed byRāma, that one of high austerities and excellent vows beganin the midst of the saints to describe the oppulence of thatregion."

And he was cognizantof duty, and ever engaged in observing vows and honoringgood men. And that high-souled one begat on Vaidarbhi,sprung from a respectable line, and endowed with all noblequalities, four sons like unto himself, and possessed ofextraordinary prowess—Kucyāmva, and Kuçanābha, andAsurtarajas, and Vasu, resplendent and breathing exhaustlessspirits. And with the deisre of enhancing Kshetryamerit, Kuça said unto his truthful and virtuous sons,—'Yesons! do ye engage in the task of governing,—and therebyacquire immense merit.' Hearing Kuja's words, those fourforemost of men and best of sons addressed themselves tofounding seats for their government. And the highlyenergetic Kucāmva founded the city of Kaucāmvi; and therighteous Kuçanābha, the metropolis of Mahodaya; andthe magnanimous Asurtarajas, Dharmāranya; and kingVasu, Girivraja, best of capitals. This city with these fivemighty mountains shining around (otherwise) called Vasumatibelongs to the high-souled Vasu. And the river known bythe name of Sumāgadhi flows through the Magadhas. Andin the midst of the five foremost of hills, it looks like agarland. And this Māgadhi, O Rāma, belongs unto the high-souled Vasu, taking, O Rāma, an easterly course, and flowingthrough fertile fields furnished with corn. And, O descendantof Raghu, the virtuous-souled Rājarshi Kuçanābha begatan hundred peerless daughters on Ghritāchi. And it came topass that they endowed with youth, beautiful, and like untothe lightning in the rainy season, decked in excellent ornaments,coming to their garden, were merrily singing anddancing and playing on musical instruments, O Rāghava! Andas they perfect in every limb, and unparalleled on earth inbeauty, and endowed with all qualities, and furnished with youthand grace, were in the garden, like unto stars embosomedamong clouds, that life of all, the air, beheld them and said,—\"I seek for ye: do ye become my wives. Do ye renounce thishuman guise, and attain long lives. Youth verily is unstable,specially with the human beings: do ye attaining unfadingyouth, become immortal:\" Hearing this speech of the Air ofever fresh energy, the damsels ridiculing it, said,—\"Thourangest the hearts of all creatures, O foremost of celestials,and we also know thy influence. Wherefore, then, dostthou dishonor us? O foremost of celestials, we are thedaughters of Kuçanābha, O divine one. And god as thouart, we can dislodge thee from thy place; but we refrainfrom doing so, lest thereby we lose our ascetic merit. May,O foolish one, that time never come, when disregardingour truthful sire, we following our inclination, shall resortto self choice. Our father verily is our lord and prime god. Ofhim even shall we become the wives unto whom our fathergiveth us away.\" At these words of theirs, that lord and adorableone, the Air, exceedingly enraged, then entered into theirbodies, and broke all their limbs. Their bodies being thusbroken by Air, those damsels, exceedingly agitated andoverwhelmed with shame, with tears in their eyes entered theresidence of the king. And finding his supremely beautifuland favorite daughters with their limbs broken, and woe-begone, the king bewildered, spake,—'Ye daughters, whatis this? Who is it that thus disregards virtue? Bywhom have ye all come by this crooked form? And whydemonstrating your grief, do ye not answer me?' Havingsaid this, the king heaved a deep sigh and became eagerto hear all about it.\""

Do thou ask our father about it, if he consentconferring us on thee.—But that wicked wight did notlisten to our words; and as we were saying this, were weroughly handled by him.' Hearing those words of theirs, thehighly pious and puissant king addressed his hundred beautifuldaughters, saying,—'Ye have displayed a signal exampleof that forgiveness which is fit to be followed by the forbearing;and that ye have unanimously regarded the honor ofmy house, also conduces to your praise. Alike to men andwomen, forbearance is an ornament. And difficult it is forone to exercise that forbearance, specially in respect of thecelestials. And may every descendant of mine possessforbearance like unto yours! Forbearance is charity; forbearanceis truth; forbearance, O daughters, is sacrifice; forbearanceis fame; forbearance is virtue,—yea,the universe is establishedin forbearance. Then dismissing his daughters, the kingendowed with the prowess of celestials,and versed in counsel,began to consult with his counsellors about the bestowalof his daughters in respect of time and place and personand equality of lineage. And it came to pass that at thistime an ascetic named Chuli, highly effulgent, with his vitalfluid under control, and of pure practices, was performingBrāhmya austerities. And as the saint was engaged inausterities, good betide thee, Urmilā's daughter namedSomadā—a Gandharbi—ministered unto him. And in allhumility that virtuous one for a definite period was engagedin ministering unto him. And thereat, her spiritual guidewas gratified with her. And, O descendant of Raghu, oncehe said unto her,—'I am gratified good betide thee! Whatgood shall I render thee? Thereupon, concluding that theascetic was gratified, the Gandharbi, cognizant of words,exceedingly delighted, sweetly addressed that one versedin speech,—'Thou art furnished with the Brāhmya fire, art likeBrahmā himself, and of mighty austerities. I desire of theea righteous son endowed with the Brāhmya ascetic virtues.I am without a husband, good betide thee, and I am no one'swife. Upon me who am thy servant, thou shouldst confersuch a son by help of Brāhmya means.' Thereupon, wellpleased with her, the Brahmārshi Chulina conferred upon heran excellent Brāhmya mind-begotten son, named Brahmādatta.And that king, Brahmādatta, founded the flourishingcity of Kampilyā,even as the sovereign of the celestials foundedthe celestial regions. And, O Kākutstha, the righteousking Kuçanābha finally decided on conferring his hundreddaughters upon Brahmādatta. And inviting Brahmādattathat highly energetic lord of earth, with a glad heartconferred his hundred daughters upon him. And, Odescendant of Raghu, king Brahmādatta resembling the lordhimself of the celestials, by turns received their hands inmarriage. And as soon as he touched them, the hundreddaughters were cured of their crookedness, and became freefrom anguish, and were endowed with pre-eminent beauty,And upon beholding them delivered from (the tyranny of) theAir, the monarch Kuçanābha became exceedingly delighted,and rejoiced again and again. And he dismissed the newlymarried lord of earth, king Brahmādatta, in company with hisconsorts and the priests. And the Gandharbi Somadārejoiced exceedingly at the completion of the nuptials of herson; and embracing her daughters-in-law again and again,and extolling her son, she expressed the fulness of her joy.\""

Andwhen the sacrifice had commenced, that son of Brahmā, theexceedingly noble Kuça, spake unto king Kuçanabha, saying,'O son, there will be born unto thee a virtuous son liketo thyself: thou wilt obtain even Gādhi,—and throughhim enduring fame in this world.' Having said this untoking Kuçanābha, Kuça, O Rāma, entering the welkin,went to the eternal regions of Brahmā. Then aftersometime, an eminently virtuous son, named Gādhi, was bornto the intelligent Kucanābha. O Kākutstha, even thathighly pious Gādhi is my sire. And, O descendant of RaghuI, called Kauçika, am sprung from Kuça's line. And, ORāghava, I had a sister of noble vows born before me. Andher name was Satyavati; and she was bestowed uponRichika. And following her lord, she ascended heaven inher own proper person. And my highly generous sister,Kauçiki, hath finally assumed the form of a mighty river.And in order to compass the welfare of all creatures, mysister is now a noble and charming river of sacred waters,issuing from the Himavat mountains. And thenceforth, out ofaffection for my sister, Kauciki, I ever dwell happily in thevicinity of the Himavat, O Rāghava. And that virtuousKauçiki, Satyavati, as well established in religion astruth, and chaste, and eminently pious, is now the foremostof streams. And, O Rāma it is only for the purpose of completingmy sacrifice that leaving her behind, I have come toSiddhāçrama. And now by virtue of thy energy, haveI attained fruition. Now, O Rāma, I have narrated unto theethe circumstances connected with the history of myline and myself, as also of this place, O mighty-armedone,—which thou hadst asked me to relate. But, OKākutstha, while I was speaking, half the night hath been spent.Do thou now sleep, good betide thee,—so that thou mayst notfeel any difficulty while on the journey. The trees standmotionless, and the beasts and birds are silent, and, O descendantof Raghu, all sides have become enveloped in nocturnalgloom. The midnight is gradually passing away; andthe firmament thick-studded with stars resembling eyes, isillumined up with their light. And that dispeller of darkness,the mild-beaming moon, is rising, gladdening thehearts of all creatures with his splendour. And night-rangingbeings—terrible carnivorous Yakshas and Rākshasas—walk hither and thither.\" Having said this, the mightyascetic of exceeding energy paused. And those asceticshonoring him, said,—\"Excellent! Excellent! Thisline belonging to the Kuçikas is ever exalted and devoted tovirtue, And those foremost of men sprung in the Kuçarace are high-souled and like unto Brahmārshis—andspecially thou, O illustrious Viçwāmitra, art so. And thatbest of streams, Kauçiki, hath added lustre unto thy line.\"and the auspicious son of Kuçika having been extolled bythose delighted ascetics—the foremost of their order—slept,like unto the sun, when setting.

And having beheld that river furnished withsacred waters, and frequented by swans and cranes, theascetics who accompanied Rāghava were exceedinglydelighted.

Unto him were born two daughters,unparalleled on earth in loveliness. And, O Rāma, their motherof dainty waist, the amiable daughter of Meru, named Menā,was the beloved wife of Himavat—she of whom was bornGangā the elder daughter of Himavat; and, O Rāghava, asecond daughter was also born unto him, named Uma.

And these, O Rāghava, are thedaughters of that king of mountains, worshipped of all, viz., Gangā,the foremost of streams, and the divine Umā.

Thou artextensively conversant with everything relative to men or gods.Why is it that that purifier of the worlds laveth threedirections? And why is that foremost of streams, Gangā, famousas wending in three ways? And, O thou cognizant ofmorality, what are her performances in the three worlds?\" ThereatViçwāmitra having asceticism for his wealth, began torelate unto Kākutstha that history in detail in the midst ofthe ascetics. \"In days of yore, O Rāma, the blue-throatedone of mighty asceticism, having entered into matrimony,commenced upon knowing the goddess. And as thatintelligent blue-throated god, Mahādeva, was thus engaged insport, a devine hundred years passed away; and yet, O Rāma,chastiser of foes, no son was born of her. Thereat all thegods with the Grand sire at their head became exceedinglyanxious. \"Who will be able to bear the offspring of thisunion?\" And thereupon the celestials repairing untoMahādeva, thus addressed him, saluting low,—'O god of gods,O mighty deity, ever engaged in the welfare of all, itbehoveth thee to be propitious at the humble salutations ofthe celestials. The worlds, O foremost of celestials, areincapable of bearing thy energy. Therefore, for the welfareof the three worlds, do thou, being furnished with Brahmāasceticism, in company with the goddess practise austerities,and rein in thy energy by thy native indomitableness. Dothou preserve these worlds; for it becometh thee not todestroy all.' Hearing the words of the deities, the great god ofthe worlds said unto them,—'So be it!' And addressing themagain he said,—'Ye gods, by my own energy I will assistedby Umā bear my virile vigour,—therefore let the creationfind rest! But tell me, ye foremost of celestials, who willsustain my potent virility rushing out from its receptacle?'Being thus addressed, the gods answered him having thebull for his mark,—'The earth will to-day bear thy vital flow.'Thus assured, the mighty lord of the celestials let go hisvital fluid; and thereat the earth containing mountains andforests was overspread with the energy. Then the gods spakeunto the Fire, saying,—'Do thou in company with the Windenter into this fierce and mighty energy!'

Verily thou artour prime way.' Hearing the words of the deities, the Grandsireof all creatures, consoling them with soft words, spokeunto them, saying,—'Even as the Mountain's daughter hathsaid, sons will not be born unto ye of your own wives. Herword is infallible of a certainty: there is no doubt about it.This is the celestial Gangā—she on whom Hutāsana54 willbeget a son—the foe-subduing generalissimo of the celestials.And the elder daughter of the Mountain will consider thatson as brought forth by Umā; and Umā also will, withoutdoubt, look upon him with regard.' Hearing these wordsof his, O descendant of Raghu, the gods bowing unto theGrand-sire, paid him homage.

And then Pavaka from all sidesdischarged his energy into her,—and thereat all her streamsbecame surcharged with it, O descendant of Raghu. Andunto him staying at the head of all the deities, Gangā spoke,saying,—'O god, I am incapable of sustaining this new-sprung energy of thine: I am burning with that fire, andmy consciousness fails me.' Thereupon that partaker ofthe oblations offered unto the gods, said unto Gangā,—'Dothou bring forth thy embryo on the side of this Himavat!'Hearing Agni's words, Gangā of mighty energy cast herexceedingly effulgent embryo on her streams, O sinless one.And as it came out of her, it wore the splendour of moltengold; and in consequence of its fiery virtue, objects near andobjects far were converted into gold and silver ofunsurpassed sheen,—while those that were more distant wereturned into copper and iron. And her excreta were turnedinto lead. In this wise, various metals began to increase onearth. And as soon as the embryo was brought forth, thewoods adjoining the mountain, being overspread with thatenergy, were turned into gold. And from that day, O descendantof Raghu, gold of effulgence like unto that of fire, becameknown as Jātarupa, O foremost of men!

'Surely he shall be soninto us all'—concluding thus, they as soon as he was born,by turns began to dispense milk unto him. Then the celestialscalled him Kārtikeya, saying,—'Without doubt, thisson shall become famed over the three worlds.' And hearingthose words of theirs,the Kirtikās bathed the offspring that hadissued from her womb, flaming like fire, and with auspiciousmarks. And, O Kākutstha, since Kārtikeya had issued from(Gangā's) womb, the celestials called that effulgent andmighty-armed one, Skanda.56 And then the teats of theKritikās were filled with milk; and thereupon assumingsix mouths, he began to suck milk from the teats of thosesix. And having drunk the milk, that lord although thenpossessed of a tender frame, by virtue of his inborn prowessin one day vanquished the Danava forces.

Andwhen a full hundred years had been numbered, the ascetic thathad been adored by means of these austerities, Brighu, best ofthose endowed with truth,conferred a boon upon Sagara, saying,—'O sinless one, thou shalt obtain glorious offspring;and, O foremost of men, thou shalt attain unparalleled renownamong men. And, O child, one of thy consorts shall bringforth a son who will perpetuate thy race; and the othergive birth to sixty thousand sons.'

And propitiating that high-souled one, theywith melancholy countenances and in exceeding agitation,spoke these words unto the Grand-sire,—'O adorable one, theentire earth is being excavated by the sons of Sagara; andmany are the high souled ones as well as the aquatic animalsthat are being slain in consequence.—This one is the disturberof our sacrifice, and by him hath the sacrificial horse beenstolen,—saying this, Sagara's sons are committing havoc uponall creatures.\""

And that adorable one isindeed her lord. And assuming the form of Kapila, heunceasingly sustaineth the Earth. And the sons of king Sagarawill be consumed by the fire of his wrath. The pre-ordainedexcavation of the Earth, as well as the destruction ofSagara's sons, had been foreseen by the far-sighted.'Hearing the words of the Grand-sire, those repressors oftheir foes, the three and thirty60 celestials, being exceedinglyrejoiced, went back to their respective quarters. And as thesons of Sagara were riving the Earth, there arose a mightynoise, like unto the bursting of thunder. Then, having riventhe entire Earth and ranged it all around, the sons of Sagaratogether (returned to their father) and spake unto him, saying—'By us hath the Earth been extensively surveyed, and havepowerful deities and Dānavas, Rākshasas, Piçāchas, Uragaiand Pannagas been slain; and yet do we find neither thehorse nor the stealer thereof. What are we to do now? Goodbetide thee, do thou consider it well.' Hearing those wordsof his sons, that foremost of kings, getting into a wrath, said,O descendant of Raghu,—'Do ye yet again, good betide ye,delve the earth, and having got at the stealer of the horse,cease.' Receiving this mandate of their sire, the sixty-thousand sons of the high-souled Sagara rushed towards thedepths of the earth. And as they were engaged in excavating,they beheld the elephant of the quarter resembling ahill, named Virupāksha, holding the earth. And, O son ofRaghu, that mighty elephant, Virupāksha, held on hishead the entire earth with its mountains and forests.And, O Kākutstha, when on sacred days the mighty elephant,from fatigue, shaketh his head, then takes place the earthquake.Thereupon, O Rāma, going round that mightyelephant, and honoring him duly, they went on piercing theunderearth. And having pierced the East, they piercedthe South,—and in the Southern quarter also they beheld amighty elephant—the high-souled Mahāpadma, resemblinga huge hill, holding the earth on his head. And thereat theymarvelled greatly. And having gone round him, the sixty-thousand sons of the high-souled Sagara began to penetrateinto the Western region. And in the Western quarter alsothose highly powerful ones beheld the elephant of thatquarter named Saumanasa, resembling a mighty mountain.And having gone round him, and asked him as to his welfare,they delving on, arrived at the Northern region. Andon the North likewise, O foremost of the Raghus, they beheldBhadra, white as snow, holding this earth on his goodlyperson. And having felt as well as gone round him, thosesixty thousand sons of Sagara went on penetrating thedepths of the earth. Then repairing to the famous North-eastern region, Sagara's sons becoming enraged, began todig the earth. And there those high-souled, exceedinglypowerful and vehement ones beheld the eternal Vāsudevain the guise of Kapila. And there also, experiencingexceeding delight, O descendant of Raghu, they found hishorse, browsing hard by. And knowing him to be thedestroyer of the sacrifice, they bearing spades, and ploughs,and innumerable trees and crags, with eyes reddened withire, furiously rushed against him, exclaiming,—'Stay! Stay!And thou it is that hast stolen our sacrificial horse. O thouof wicked understanding, know that thou hast fallen into thehands of the sons of Sagara.' Hearing this speech oftheirs, Kapila, O descendant of Raghu, overwhelmed withrage uttered a tremendous roar. And then, O Kākutstha,the sons of Sagara were reduced to ashes by the high-souledand incomparable Kapila.\""

Do thou enquire into thecircumstances that have befallen thy uncles, as also about the wayby which the horse hath escaped. And as there are stongand mighty creatures inhabiting the Earth's interior, withthe view of resisting them, do thou take thy bow along withthy scimitar. And honoring those that deserve to be honoredand slaying such as disturb thee, do thou, having attainedthy end, come back, becoming the instrument for thecompletion of my sacrifice.' Thus duly enjoined by thehigh-souled Sagara, Ançumat endowed with fleet vigor, takinghis bow as well as his scimitar, set out. And commanded by themonarch, O best of men, he found the underground way thathad been carved out by those high-souled ones. And hefound an exceedingly powerful elephant belonging to thecardinal point, worshipped by deities, and Dānavas, andRākshasas, and goblins, and birds, and Uragas. And havinggone round him, and asked him as to his welfare, he enquiredafter his uncles and the stealer of the horse. Hearing this,the mighty-minded elephant of that quarter answered—'Oson of Asamanja, having attained thy object, thou wiltspeedily return with the horse.' And hearing those words ofhis, Ançumat by turns duly asked the same question of all theelephants belonging to the cardinal points. And being honoredby those guardians of the cardinal points, knowing wordsas well as their application in regard to time, place, andperson, he was asked by them, saying,—'Do thou comewith the horse!' Hearing those words of theirs, that oneof fleet vigor repaired unto the spot where the sonsof Sagara, his uncles, had been reduced to a heap of ashes.And (arriving there), Asamanja's son, smitten with grief,and being exceedingly afflicted at their destruction, bewailedin heaviness of heart. And exercised by grief and sorrow,that foremost of men espied there the sacrificial horse strayingnear. And desirous of offering oblations of water unto thoseprinces, that highly powerful one in need of water, did not findany watery expanse in the neighbourhood. And it came topass, O Rāma, that surveying wide, he descried the maternaluncle unto the princes, Suparna, the lord of birds, resemblingthe Wind. And thereupon Vinatā's son possessed ofmighty strength spoke unto him, saying,—'Do not lament,O foremost of men. The destruction of these was for thewelfare of all. These highly powerful ones had beenconsumed by the peerless Kapila,—therefore, thou ought not tooffer water unto them in consonance with social usuage.Gangā, O foremost of men, is the elder daughter ofHimavat. In her (streams) do thou perform the watery ritesof thy uncles, O mighty-armed one: let that purifier of theworlds lave these, reduced to a heap of ashes. And on theseashes being watered by Gangā, dear unto all, the sixtythousand sons of Sagara will repair unto the celestial regions.Do thou, O highly pious one, go back, taking this horse, Oforemost of men; and do thou complete the sacrifice of thygrand-father, O hero.' Hearing Suparna's speech, theexceedingly powerful Ançumat of mighty asceticism speedilytaking the horse, retraced his steps. Then coming to theking who had been initiated into the ceremony, he, Odescendant of Raghu, faithfully communicated unto himthe words of Suparna, Hearing this sorrowful intelligence,the king duly finished the sacrifice agreeably to the scriptures.And having seen the completion of the sacrifice, thatlord of earth entered his capital; but the king could not seehow to bring Gangā on earth. And without being able toascertain it, the mighty monarch after a long course oftime, and having reigned for thirty thousand years, ascendedheaven.\""

And,O Raghu's son, consigning unto Dilipa his kingdom, Ançumatentered upon rigid austerities on the romantic summit of theHimavat. And having for the space of thirty-two hundreds ofthousands years carried on austeries in the woods, that highlyfamous one, crowned with the wealth of aceticism, attainedthe celestial regions. And the exceedingly powerful Dilipa,hearing of the destruction of his grand-fathers, was strickenwith grief; yet he could not ascertain his course about it.And he constantly thought as to how Gangā could bebrought down, how to perform their watery rites, and how todeliver them. And as that pious one furnished with self-knowledge was always meditating upon this, an eminentlyvirtuous son was born unto him named Bhagiratha. Andperforming numerous sacrifices, the mighty king Dilipa reignedfor thirty thousand years. And without having arrived at anydefinite decision in regard to their deliverance, the king, Opuissant one, being attacked with an ailment, breathed hislast. And having sprinkled his son Bhagiratha in the wayof installing him in the kingdom, that prime of men, theking, by virtue of his own acts, repaired to the region ofIndra. And, O descendant of Raghu, that royal saintBhagiratha was possessed of righteousness, And being withoutissue, and desiring to obtain it, the mighty monarch consignedhis kingdom and his subjects to the care of his counsellors,and engaged in bringing down Gangā. And, O Raghu'sdescendant, restraining his senses, and eating once a month,and surrounding himself with five fires, and with armsupraised, he for a long lapse of time performed austerities atGokarna. And as he was performing his terrible austerities,a thousand years rolled away. And thereat that possessor ofthe six attributes and lord of all creatures, Brahmā, waswell-pleased with that high-souled monarch. And presentinghimself together with the celestials, the Grand-sire thus spokeunto the high-souled Bhagiratha engaged in austerities,—'0Bhagiratha, O mighty monarch, pleased am I with thee, Olord of men, on account of thy ardent austerities; do thou,O thou of excellent vows, ask for the boon thou wouldsthave.' Thereupon that great car-warrior, the highly powerfuland mighty-armed Bhagiratha, with clasped hands, saidunto the Grand-sire of all creatures,—'If, adorable one,thou art pleased with me, if thou wouldst grant me the fruitof my asceticism, may Sagara's sons receive water at myhands; and on the ashes of those high-souled ones beinglaved by the waters of Gangā, may my great-grand-fatherswithout fail repair unto heaven! And, O divine one, Ibeseech thee, may our line never languish for want ofoffspring. May, O God, this prime boon light upon Ikshwāku'srace!' When the king had said this, the Grand-sire addressedhim these sweet and auspicious words composed ofmelting letters,—'O mighty car-warrior Bhagiratha, high isthis thy aim. Be it so, good betide thee, thou enhancer ofthe Ikshwāku line. This Haimavati Gangā, Himavat's elderdaughter, even her to hold, O king, do thou employ Hara; forGangā's fall, O king, Earth will not be able to sustain. Andto hold her, O king, find I none save the weilder of theTrident.\" Having thus addressed the monarch, and greetedGangā, the creator of the worlds repaired to heaven with thecelestials."

  "Bālakāndam and Ayodhyākāndam": "When that god of gods had gone away, Bhagiratha,O Rāma, pressing the earth with his thumb, spent a year inadoring Sivā. And when the year was complete, Uma's lord,Paçupati, worshipped of all the worlds, spake unto the king,saying,—'O foremost of men, I am well-pleased with thee:I will do what will be for thy welfare. I will hold theMountain's daughter on my head.' Then, O Rāma, that onebowed unto by all creatures, the elder daughter of Himavat,assuming an exceedingly mighty shape, with irresistibleimpetus precipitated herself from the welkin upon Sivā'sgracious head. And that divine one, Gangā, exceedinglydifficult to sustain, thought,—'I will enter the nether regions,carrying off Sankara by my streams.' Knowing herproud intention, the adorable Hara waxed wroth; and thethree-eyed deity set his heart upon enveloping her. And,O Rāma, as that sacred one plunged upon Rudra's holyhead of tangled locks, resembling Himavat, she could by nomeans reach the earth, despite all her endeavours; nor didshe obtain egress from under the matted locks. And shewandered there for many a year. And finding Gangā inthis plight, Bhagiratha became again engaged in highausterities. And thereupon Sivā, O descendant of Raghu,was exceedingly gratified; and cast Gangā off in the directionof the Vindu lake. And as she was let off, seven streamsbranched out from her. And the three streams of theexcellent Gangā of auspicious waters went in an easterlydirection; while the Suchakshu, the Sitā, and that mighty riverthe Sindhu flowed on the auspicious west. And the seventhfollowed Bhagiratha's car. And that royal saint, theexceedingly puissant Bhagiratha, mounted on a superb car,went before; and Gangā followed him. And shedescended from the welkin upon Sankara's head, thencealighting upon the earth; and there her waters flowedwith thundering sounds. And earth looked beautiful withswarms of fallen and falling fishes, and tortoises, andporpoises. And then celestials and saints and Gandharbas, andYakshas and Siddhas mounted on excellent elephants andhorses and cars resembling cities, looked on Gangādescending upon the earth. And the celestials stationed on carswere struck with surprise; and all creatures marvelled atthe excellent descent of Gangā. And eager to witnessthe spectacle, celestial hosts of immeasurable energy camethere. And in consequence of the celestials coming thither,and the effulgence of their ornaments, the firmament freefrom clouds, shone as if with an hundred suns. And thesky was graced with fast-fleeting porposies and serpentsand fishes resembling playing lightning; and the welkinscattered with pale foam-flakes by thousands, appeared as ifit was scattered with autumnal clouds swarming with cranes.And the river proceeded sometimes rapidly, and sometimesawry, and sometimes in volumes, and sometimes sloping,and sometimes ascending, and sometimes languidly; andsometimes water clashed with water; and sometimesascending an upland, it descended into a dell. And thepellucid and pure water first descending upon Sankara's head,and thence on to the earth, appeared exceedingly beautiful.And there the saints and the Gandharbas, as well as theinhabitants of the earth, touched the sacred waterflowing from Bhaba's body. And those that had fallenfrom the sky unto the earth in consequence of some curse orother, having bathed there, and thereby having their sinswashed and removed by that sanctifying water, againascended the sky and entered their respective regions. Andthrough the agency of that shining water, all beings, feelingdelight, rejoiced, and having bathed in Gangā, becamecleansed from sin. And stationed on an excellent car thatmighty king, the royal saint Bhagiratha, went first, andGangā went at his back. And the gods, and the saints, andthe Daityas, and the Dānavas, and the Rākshasas, and theforemost of Gandharbas and Yakshas, and the Kinnaras, andthe mighty Uragas, and the Serpents, and the Apsarās, ORāma and the acquatic animals in a body followingBhagiratha's car, with glad hearts went in the wake of Gangā. Andwithersoever king Bhagiratha went, the famous Gangā,foremost of streams, capable of destroying all sins, went. AndGangā flooded the sacrificial ground of the high-souled Jahnu, ofwonderful deeds, as he was performing a sacrifice. Thereat,O Rāghava, reading her insolence, Jahnu, waxing wroth,drank up all her wonderful waters. Thereupon, the deities,and the Gandharbas, and the saints, struck with amazement,fell to worshipping that foremost of men, the high-souled Jahnuand brought Gangā into the daughtership of that high souledone. And that highly energetic lord, being propitiated, letGangā off through his ears. Therefore it is that Gangā goesby the name of Jahnu's daughter Jāhnavi. Then Gangā againbegan to follow Bhagiratha's car. And having reached theocean, that foremost of streams, with the object ofaccomplishing his work, entered into the subterranean regions. Andhaving carefully brought Gangā, that royal saint, Bhagiratha,having his senses bewildered beheld his grand-fathersreduced to ashes. And the excellent waters of Gangā overflowedthat heap of ashes; and thereupon, O best of the Raghus,they, their sins purged, attained heaven.\""

And, Olord of earth, as long as the waters of the ocean shallendure in the world, Sagara's sons shall reside in heavenlike unto celestials. And this Gangā shall become thyeldest daughter; and she shall attain celebrity among all, beingcalled after thy name. And Gangā is called both Tripathagāand Bhāgirathi. And she is known as Tripathagā, inconsequence of her proceeding in three directions. Do thou now,O lord of men, here offer oblations of water unto thy grandsires,—and thereby, O king, make good thy promise. And,O king, that foremost of righteous ones, thy ancestor ofexceeding renown, had failed to atain his desire. And, Ochild, Ançumat likewise unparalleled in the worlds in energyhad failed in realising his cherished promise of bringingdown Gangā. And then again that royal saint, crownedwith qualities, of austerities like unto mine, ever abidingby his Kshatriya duties, even Dilipa's self—thy exceedinglypuissant sire—O eminently righteous one—had failed inbringing down Gangā according to his cherished resolve, Osinless one. And now, O foremost of men, that promisehaving been fulfilled by thee, thou shalt attain signal glory in theworld by the common consent of all. And, O vanquisher ofthy foes, having brought about Gangā's descension, thoushalt from this act of thine also attain the regions of Brahmā.Do thou, O best of men, lave thyself in these waters incapableof being rendered worthless. O prime of men,—and therebybecome purified, and attain sanctity. And do thouperform the watery rites of thy grand-sires. May luck bethine, I shall now repair to my own regions: do thou depart,O king.' Having said this, the illustrious lord of the celestials—the Grand-sire of all creatures—went unto the celestial regions.And the royal saint king Bhagiratha also of high fame havingperformed his ablutions and purified himself, and duly and inproper order offered oblations of water unto the sons of Sagara,entered his capital. And attaining exceeding prosperity, thatforemost of men ruled his kingdom; and, O descendant ofRaghu, having him as their sovereign, the people rejoicedgreatly; and with their griefs removed, and prosperity secured,they lived in peace of mind. Thus, O Rāma, have Idetailed unto thee the history of Gangā. Auspiciousnessmayst thou obtain! Good betide thee, the evening drawethnigh. He that reciteth this story conferring prosperity, fame,long life, and heaven unto Vipras, Kshatriyas, and others, attaineththe good graces of his ancestors and the celestials; and,O Kākutstha, he that listeneth to the sacred history of Gangesdescent, conferring length of days, attaineth all his desires,and all his sins are destroyed, and his life and fame increase.'"

And,O afflicter of foes, as we had been reflecting upon all this atlength, the night hath passed away as if it were a moment.And the live-long night hath passed away as I in companywith Sumitrā's son, was pondering over Viçwāmitra'sauspicious speech.\" Then in the morning which happened to bebright, that subduer of his foes, Raghu's descendant,addressed the ascetic Viçwāmitra, who had finished hisdevotion,—\"The auspicious night is past,—and we shall (again)listen to thy wonderful narrations. Let us now cross overthis sacred stream—foremost of rivers—wending in threeways. And learning that thou hast arrived at this place,the pious ascetics have speedily come hither, and havealso brought this barque with a spacious carpet.\" Hearingthose words of the high-souled Rāghava, Kauçika crossedover the crowds of ascetics; and on reaching the north bank,he paid homage unto the saints. And when they had landedon the banks of tlie Gangā, they beheld a city namedViçāla. And thereupon speedily that foremost of asceticsin company with Rāghava, went towards Viçāla,—beautifuland elegant like unto the celestial regions. Then the highlywise Rāma, with folded hands, asked that mighty asceticViçwāmitra concerning the excellent city of Viçāla,-\"0 mightyascetic, what royal line resideth in yonder large city? Idesire to hear this, good betide thee; and great is mycuriosity.\" Hearing those words of Rāma, that foremost ofascetics began to relate the history of Viçāla, saying,—\"Dothou listen, O Rāma, to what I had heard from Sakrarelating this history; and, O descendant of Raghu, do thoulisten to all that befell in this city. Formerly in the Kritaage, O Rāma, Diti's highly powerful sons, as well as thoseof Aditi, possessed of prowess, and virtuous and pious—high-souled ones both—O foremost of men, fell toreflecting,—'How can we become exempt from decrepitude anddisease, and immortal.' And as they reflected, it struckthem,—'By churning the ocean of milk, we must obtainambrosia.' Then deciding upon churning (the ocean), thoseones of immeasurable energy making Vāsuki the cord, andthe Mandara (hill), the stick, began to churn the deep. Andafter a thousand years had gone by, the hoods (of theserpent) serving as the churning cord, began to vomit virulentvenom and to bite at the crags, with their fangs. Andthereat there came out powerful poison like unto fire; andin consequence the entire universe with celestials, and Asuras,and men, began to burn. And thereupon, intending to seekrefuge, they appeared before that mighty god, Sankara, orPaçupati, or Rudra,—hymning him,—'Save us.' 'Save us.'When that master, the lord of the celestials, was being thusaddressed by the deities, there appeared before them Haribearing the conch and the discus. And smiling Hari said untothe trident-bearing Rudra,—'O chief of the celestials, sincethou art the foremost of the gods, this that hath come out ofthe ocean churned by the celestials, is thine. Remaining here,O lord, do thou receive the first offering in the form of thispoison.' Having said this, that best of celestials vanishedthere. Witnessing the dismay of the celestials, and hearingalso the words of Sarngin, Sivā took in that dreadful poisonas if it were nectar; and then leaving the deities, theworshipful Hara went away. And then, O descendant of Raghu,as the celestials resumed the churning, that foremost of hillsserving as the cord, entered the subterranean regions.Thereupon the gods and the Gandharbas fell to extolling theslayer of Madhu, saying,—'Thou art the way of all beings,of the celestials in especial. Do thou, O mighty-armed one,protect us, and recover the mountain.' Having heard this,Hrishikesa, or Hari, assuming the form of a tortoise, stood inthe sea, supporting the hill on his back; and that Soul of all,Keçava best of male beings, taking hold of the top of thehill by his hand, began to churn the deep, stationed in themidst of the celestials. And after a thousand years had rolledon, arose a male being impregnated with the Ayurveda,61of exceedingly righteous soul, called Dhanwantari, bearingin his hands a stick, and a Kamandalu. And there arosealso, from the cream of the churning waters, those magnificentdames the shining Apsarās. And, O foremost of men, as theyhad emerged from water, they are called Apsarās.62 Andthere sprang sixty Kotis of shining Apsarās. And, OKākutstha, the female attendants of those are numberless. And neitherthe deities nor the Dānavas would accept them,—and inconsequence of this non-acceptance, they are known as womenbelonging to all. And then, O Raghu's descendant, arose theeminently pious daughter of Varuna, Vāruni, who fell tolooking for acceptance. And Diti's sons, O Rāma, did not acceptthe daughter of Varuna,—and Aditi's sons, O hero, acceptedthat one of blameless limbs. And hence Diti's sons go bythe name of Asuras; and Aditi's by that of Suras. And thecelestials became exceeding glad, on having accepted Vāruni.And, O foremost of men, next arose Uchhaiçravā—best ofhorses, and also Kaustubha; and next, the excellent ambrosia.And,0 Rāma, tremendous was the carnage for the porsessionthereof (ambrosia); and Aditi's and Diti's sons foughttogether. And the Asuras assembled together with theRākshasas; and, O hero, mighty was the battle that wasfought, striking terror into the three worlds. And when agreat havoc had been committed, the highly powerful Vishnu,assuming a captivating form speedily stole away the ambrosia.And those that came forward before that best of male beings,Vishnu, knowing no deterioration, were crushed in conflictby Vishnu in a different form. And in that exceedinglydreadful battle between the sons of Diti and Aditi, thoseheroic ones, viz., Aditi's heroic sons slaughtered those of Diti.And having slaughtered the sons of Diti and regained hiskingdom, Purandara, happily began to rule the worlds,containing saints and Chāranas.\""

And I will engage in austerities:it behoves thee to grant me such an embryo,—such aslayer of Sakra it behoves thee to promise me.' Hearingthose words of hers, Maricha's son, Kaçyapa of exceedingenergy answered the deeply aggrieved Diti, saying,—'Beit so.' Good betide thee, do thou become pure, O ascetic. Ifthou remain pure, when a full thousand years shall becomplete, thou wilt give birth unto a son who will slay Sakrain battle. And through me, thou wilt give birth to a sonthat will destroy the three worlds.' Having said this, thathighly energetic one rubbed her person with his palm. Andhaving rubbed her, he said,—'Luck!' and then went awayto carry on austerities. And when he had gone, Diti,O foremost of men, becoming exceedingly delighted, wentunto Kuçaplava63 and began to practise rigid mortifications.And, O foremost of men, as she was practising austerities,the thousand-eyed deity most dutifully ministered unto her.And the thousand-eyed one provided for her fire, and Kusa,and faggots, and water, and fruits, and roots, and otherthings that she wanted. And at all times, Sakra served Ditiby rubbing her person, and removing her fatigue. And whenten years only were wanting to complete the thousand years,Diti, O descendant of Raghu, being exceedingly delighted,thus spoke unto the thousand-eyed one,—'O best of thoseendowed with prowess, of me engaged in austerities, tenyears only remain (to complete the period.) And after thattime, good betide thee, thou wilt behold thy brother. I will,O son, bind him unto thee in affection, whom I had besoughtfor to compass thy destruction,—so that, the fever of thyheart removed, thou wilt with him enjoy the victory of thethree worlds. On thy high-souled sire having been besoughtby me, he, O foremost of celestials, granted me the boon thatafter a thousand years, I shall obtain a son.' And it cameto pass that having said this, the sun being in his meridian,the worshipful Diti with her feet placed at that part of the bedwhich should contain her head, was overpowered by sleep.And thereupon seeing her resting her feet at the place whereshe should place her head,—and consequently unclean, Sakrawas exceedingly delighted, and smiled. And, O Rāma,Purandara entered into her womb, and that highly self-controlledone severed the embryo in seven parts. And the embryobeing pierced by the thunder-bolt of an hundred knots,cried at the top of its voice, and thereat Diti awoke. 'Do notcry, do not cry,'—exclaimed Sakra: and even while it wascrying, the mighty-minded Vāsava continued piercing it'Do not slay it; do not slay it,' said Diti. Thereupon, inconsideration of the honor of his mother, Sakra went out."

And here stood a palace, built by him, called Viçālā.And Viçāla's son, O Rāma, was the mighty Hemachandra.And after Hemachandra comes the celebrated Suchandra.And, O Rāma, the son of Suchandra was Dhumrāswa. Andthen was born Srinjaya, son unto Dhumrāswa. AndSrinjaya's son was the powerful Sahadeva. And Sahadeva's sonwas the pre-eminently pious Kuçāçwa. And Kuçāçwa'sson was the puissant Somadatta. And now, O Kākutstha,Somadatta's son the effulgent and invincible and renownedSumati resideth in this city. And by the grace ofIkshwāku, all the sovereigns of Viçālā are long-lived, and high-souled, and puissant, and pious. And here will we happilyspend a night; and on the morning of the morrow thou wilt,O foremost of men., behold Janaka.' And having heard thatthe illustrious Viçwāmitra had come, that best of kings, theeffulgent Sumati, appeared before him. And having paidViçwāmitra high homage together with his priests and friends,and with clasped hands enquired after the former's welfare,he addressed Viçwāmitra, saying,— \"Blessed are we, andobliged are we, whose domains, O ascetic, have been gracedwith thy presence.

HearingViçwāmitra's words, the king was extremely surprised andhaving those sons of Daçarātha as his all-worthy guests,received with becoming respect those highly powerful onesdeserving of hospitality. And meeting with such splendidreception from Sumati, those descendants of Raghu spentthere a night, and the next day set out for Mithila. Andbeholding Janaka's beauteous city, the ascetics exclaiming,—'Excellent, excellent' fell to admiring Mithila. And ina grove at Mithila, Rāghava saw an ancient, lonely, andromantic asylum, and asked that foremost of ascetics,saying,—\"What is this that looketh like an asylum, thoughwithout any ascetics? I wish to hear, O worshipful one, towhom this asylum belonged in time past.\" Hearing thisspeech addressed by Raghu's descendant, that one versedin speech, the highly energetic and mighty saint, Viçwāmitra,answered,—\"Ah! Do thou listen. I will tell thee throughthe wrath of what high-souled one this hermitage came tobe cursed. O foremost of men, this excellent asylum honoredby ths celestials themselves, formerly belonged to the high-souled Gautama. And here, O illustrious prince, in daysof yore Gautama in company with Ahalyā carried onausterities for a long series of years. And perceiving occasion,Sachi's lord, the thousand-eyed deity, assuming the formof that ascetic thus addressed Ahalyā,—'0 exceedinglybeautiful one, those bent upon sport, do not stay for themenstrual season. And, O graceful one, I desire to enjoythy company (on the instant). Thereupon, out of curiosity,that one of perverse understanding consented to theproposals of the chief of the celestials. Then, having attained herobject, she spoke unto that foremost of the celestials,saying.—'O best of the immortals, I have obtained my desire,—do thou speedily go from his place, O lord. Do thou,O lord of the celestials, from a sense of repectibilitypreserve thyself and me also.' Indra too smiling, said untoAhalyā,—'O thou of shapely hips, pleased am I. Now I repairunto my own place.' Having known her thus, Indra,Rāma, exceedingly apprehensive of Gautama, then hurriedlysallied out of the thatched cottage. Just at this time, Indrasaw that mighty ascetic Gautama entering—that foremostof anchorets, incapable of being repressed by the deitiesand the Dānavas, and equipped with ascetic energy, havingbathed in the waters of holy spots, and flaming like fire,carrying faggots and kusa grass. And seeing him, thecountenance of the lord of the celestials turned pale. Andseeing the wicked thousand-eyed deity in the guise of anascetic, the well-behaved anchoret fired with rage said,—'And since, O thou of wicked understanding assuming myform, thou hast done this foul deed, thou shalt lose thyscrotum.' And soon as the high-souled Gautama had saidthis in ire, the scrotum of the thousand-eyed one droppedto the earth. And having seen Sakra in this plight, hecursed his wife also,—'For a thousand years thou shaltlive here feeding upon air, without food, tormented withrepentance and thou shalt remain in this hermitageunseen of any. And when the irrepressible son of DaçarāthaRāma, shall come to this deep wood, thou shalt be cleansedof thy sin. And, O wicked one, ministering unto him therites of hospitality, with a mind free from ignorance andcovetousness, thou shalt in thy own form with joy regainmy side.' Having said this to that wicked woman the highlyenergetic Gautama of rigid austerities, forsaking thishermitage, began to carry on penances on the romantic summitof the Himavat, inhabited by Siddhas and Charanas.\""

Andin doing so, I have been deprived of my scrotum; and Ahalyāalso hath been put down. And I have deprived him of hisascetic energy by causing him to utter a mighty curse,—and,therefore, ye celestials, and saints, and Chāranas, ye shouldrestore my scrotum unto me who have served the gods.'Hearing Satakratu's65 words, the deities along with the Marutsled by Agni, presented themselves before the divine Pitris.66And then Agni addressed the latter, saying,—'This ram ispossessed of a scrotum; while Sakra hath been deprived ofhis. Do ye taking the scrotum of the ram furnish Sakra with it.And although deprived of the scrotum, the ram will be able togrant consummate satisfaction unto ye. And on those thatwill offer such a ram for your entertainment, ye will bestowundying and profuse merit.' Hearing Agni's speech, theassembled Pitris, rooting up the scrotum of the ram, joinedit unto the person of the thousand-eyed deity. Thence-forth, Kākutstha, the divine Pitris together feast uponscrotumless rams, for their scrotum had been joined untothe person of Indra. And thenceforth, O Rāghava, Indraalso through the high-souled Gautama's ascetic energy,hath been bearing the scrotum of a ram.

Andby virtue of Gautama's word, she had been incapable of beingseen by any in the three worlds, till the sight of Rāma.And now the curse having come to an end, she could beperceived by them. And the two descendants of Raghuthen took hold of her feet; but remembering Gautama'swords, she on her part took hold of theirs. And with acollected mind she gave them water for their feet as wellas Arghya, and extended unto them the rites of hospitality.And the Kākutsthas accepted the homage thus renderedaccording to the ordinance. And blossoms began to showercopiously to the sounds of kettledrums; and the Gandharbasand the Apsarās began to rejoice greatly. And exclaiming,'Excellent, excellent,' the celestials honored Ahalyā, as with aperson purified by penance, she again came under Gautama'sgovernance. And the highly energetic Gautama also happy onhis union with Ahalyā, honored Rāma highly, and that one ofmighty mortifications then became engaged in austerities.And having duly received signal honors from the greatascetic Gautama, Rāma set out for Mithilā."

To-day, O Gādhi's son, will I humble thy prideof arms. Thou disgrace of thy race, where is thy Kshatriyamight, and where my high Brahmā energy? Do thou beholdmy superhuman Brahmā energy.' And even as water allayeththe fierceness of a flame, the Brahmā staff quenched theenergy of the powerful fiery weapon discharged by Gādhi'sson.

And it was wonderful to behold. But Brahmā'sson baffled all those by means of his staff. And on those(weapons) being resisted, the son of Gādhi hurled a Brahmāweapon. And on that weapon being discharged, the deitieswith Agni at their head, and the Devarshis, and theGandharbas, and the mighty Serpents, became afflicted with fear.And on that Brahmā weapon being discharged, all the threeworlds became exceedingly alarmed. And, O Raghu'sdescendant, Vasishtha by virtue of his Brahmā energy completelybaffled that terrible Brahmā weapon. And when thehigh-souled Vasishtha had baffled the Brahmā weapon, hisform became fierce and terrible, capable of striking terrorinto the three worlds. And from the pores of his body,resembling a smoking flame, darted out scintillations of fire.And resembling another staff of Yama, the Brahmā staff raisedby Vasishtha's arm flamed like unto the smokeless fire atthe universal dissolution. Then the ascetics in a body fellto eulogizing that best of mantra-reciting ones, Vasishtha,saying,— 'Thy might, O Brāhmana, is infallible. Do thou reinin (the Brahma) energy, by thy own. O Brāhmana, Viçwāmitraof mighty strergth hath been subdued by thee. Infallible isthy extraordinary might. Let the creatures now be relievedfrom their distress.' Thus addressed, that highly energeticone of rigid austerities, became pacified. And Viçwāmitra,being put down, heaving a sigh, said,—'Fie upon theKshatriya might: the strength begot of Brahmā energy, is mightindeed. By one Brahmā staff hath all my weapons been putto the rout. Beholding this, I with a placid mind and senseswill engage in mighty austerities,—which shall earn for meBrāhmanahood.\""

Disregarded have I been, good betide ye,by the high-souled Vasishtha. I have set my heart uponcelebrating a mighty sacrifice: it behoveth ye to command me.And, with the view of propitiating ye, I, lowly bowing downmy head, beseech the sons of my spiritual guide,—Brāhmanasever staying by asceticism,—do ye with collected mindsofficiate in this sacrifice, so that success may be secured untome; and that in body I may attain the regions of thecelestials. Disregarded by the ascetic Vasishtha, other way findI none, ye anchorets, except the sons of my spiritual guide.To the Ikshwākus, their preceptor is their prime way.Therefore after him (Vasishtha), even ye are the objectsof my adoration."

To theIkshwākus, their spiritual guide is their prime way; nor artthou capable of setting at naught the words of that truth-telling one.

Havingsaid this, those high-souled ones entered each into hisdwelling. And when the night had gone by, the king came byChandālahood. And clad in a blue garb, blue and rough of person,having a short head of hair, wearing a garland composed ofmaterials culled from a cemetery, his body bedaubed with ashesfrom the same quarter, he was decked out with iron ornaments.And, O Rāma, beholding him in the guise of a Chandāla,his counsellors as well as followers, renouncing him, fledin a body. And, Kākutstha, maintaining himself inpatience, the monarch burning day and night, all alone wentunto the ascetic Viçwāmitra.

Hearing him, the king conversant withwords, fallen into Chandāla-hood, with folded hands, saidunto that one versed in speech,—Disregarded had I beenby my spiritual guide as well as his sons. And far fromattaining my desire,I came by this calamity. O thou of placidpresence, I had desired to repair unto heaven in body. Byme have an hundred sacrifices been performed,—but yet doI not obtain the fruit thereof. I have never before told anuntruth; and I swear by my Kshatriya morality, that albeitfallen on evil days, I will never do so in future, O gentle one.And sacrifices I have celebrated many,—and I have ruled mypeople in righteousness; and I have pleased my preceptorsby my character and conduct. But, O best of ascetics, nowendeavouring to do my duty and intending to perform asacrifice, I have failed in enlisting the good graces of myspiritual guides. Therefore do I consider Destiny as supreme;and action as nothing. Destiny overtaketh all: Destiny isthe prime way. Therefore it behoveth thee to grant thyfavor unto me extremely distressed, who crave thy favor,and, good betide thee, whose endeavours have been baffledby Destiny. Other way will I wend none; nor is there anyother refuge for me. It behoveth thee to meet Destiny withexertion'.\""

Then after a long time, Viçwāmitra of mightyausterities invoked thither all the celestials for receivingtheir respective shares; but the deities did not come to receivethem. Thereupon, getting into a wrath, the mighty asceticViçwāmitra, lifting up a ladle, wrathfully spoke unto Trisanku,—'O lord of men, do thou witness the prowess of my self-earned asceticism.

Something yet remainsin me of the self-earned fruit of my asceticism; and, O king,through the energy of that asceticism, do thou repair untoheaven in person.'

The great Indra having spoken thus,Trisanku fell down, crying unto the ascetic Viçwāmitra,—'Save me, save me.'

And in the midst of the ascetics, like unto anotherPrajāpati, he created other seven Rishis84 on the Southernway; and also, overwhelmed with wrath created anotherset of stars. And collied85 with passion, that illustriousone in the midst of the ascetics created another systemof stars in the southern direction. And, saying,—'I willcreate another Indra, or the world (that I create) shallbe without an Indra.' And in anger, he went the lengthof creating celestials.

Let Trisanku evermore dwell in heaven in person,and let these stars created by me verily endure as long asthe worlds.

Saying this, Brahmā went toheaven. And when the celestials had gone, the mightyascetic, Viçwāmitra, with upraised arms, and without anysupport, and subsisting on air, began to perform penances.And in summer, the ascetic surrounded himself with five fires,and in rains remained in an uncovered place, and in winterday and night stood submerged in water. Thus passed by athousand years of terrible penances. And on the mightyascetic Viçwāmitra being engaged in austerities, great wasthe agitation that exercised the celestials and Vāsav, inparticular.

And adopting the high vowof taciturnity for a thousand years, he, O Rāma began toperform the most signal and arduous austerities. And whenthe thousaud years had been complete, many an impedimenttried the mighty Muni staying like the trunk of a tree, yetcould not anger enter his heart; and firmly determinedto shut out anger, he, O Rāma, kept his asceticism fromdeterioration. And, O foremost of the Raghus, when his vowof a thousand years had been observed, that one of mightyvows became desirous of feeding on boiled rice. And it cameto pass O best of the Raghus that at this time Indra assumingthe guise of a regenerate one, asked for the rice. Thereuponhe gave it away unto the Vipra; and when the rice had beenthus exhausted, that worshipful one of mighty austeritieswent without food. Nor, abiding by the vow of reticence,did he say aught unto the Vipra. And he then again resumedhis dumb guise, restraining his breath at the same time. Andthat puissant ascetic did not breathe for a thousand years. Andas he restrained his breath, vapours began to issue out of hishead. And, at this, the three worlds being on fire becameas if afflicted with fear. And bewildered on account of theenergy of his asceticism, and shorn of their brightness, andafflicted with anguish, the Devarshis and the Gandharbas andthe Pannagas and the Uragas and the Rākshasas in a bodyaddressed the Pitamaha,92 saying,—'O divine one, variouswere the means by which we endeavoured to affect the mightyMuni Viçwāmitra with covetuousness and lust; but for allthat he increaseth in asceticism. Nor do we perceive in himever so little of anger or lust. And if thou do not conferupon him what his mind desireth to have, he will annihilatethe thre worlds with all that is mobile and immobile in them.And the ten cardinal points are disconsolate: and nothingcan be discovered therein. And the seas are vexed, and themountains riven. And the earth shaketh, and the windskeep steadily blowing. And, O Brāhmana, we do not knowhow to remedy, this. And every one is inactive like an infidel.And the three worlds look as if stupified, with their mindsexceedingly exercised. And by virtue of that mighty saint'senergy, the sun itself hath been deprived of his splendour."

Even should he desire the dominion of the celestialregions, do thou grant him his wish.93 Then the celestialswith Pilāmaha at their head, addressed the high-souledViçwāmitra in sweet-words, saying,—'welcome, O Brahmārshi!well pleased have we been with thy penances. And, O sonof Kuçika, in consideration of thy fiery asceticism, thou hastobtained Brāhmana-hood. And, O Brāhmana, I will incompany with the Maruts confer on thee long life. Hail untothee!

And that Brahmārshi, the righteousViçwāmitra also, having attained excellent Brāhmana-hood,paid his homage unto that best of reciters, Vasishtha; andhaving secured his end, began to range the entire world,staying in asceticism.

And having, in accordance withthe scriptures, paid homage unto the former as well as thetwo high-souled Rāghavas, that virtuous one said,—\"Hail, Oworshipful sir! What shall I do unto thee, O sinless one?\"Do thou command. Surely, I deserve to be commanded by thee.Thus addressed by the high-souled Janaka, that first of asceticsendowed with a righteous soul, well versed in speech, answered,—\"These sons of Daçarātha—Kshatriyas—famed amongmen, are eager to behold that best of bows, that lies with thee.Do thou show it unto them, may it be well with thee!Having obtained a sight of that bow, the king's sons, their desirescrowned with success, will return as they list.\" Thusaccosted, Janaka replied unto the mighty Muni, saying,—\"Listento why the bow lieth here. There was a king known by thename of Devarāta. He was the elder brother of Nimi. And,O worshipful one, this bow was consigned unto the hands ofthat high-souled one as a trust. Formerly with the view ofdestroying Daksha's sacrifice, the puissant (Sivā), drawingthis bow, sportively spoke unto the celestials in ire, saying,—'Since, ye gods, ye deny me the shares (of this sacrifice),which I lay claim to, I will with my bow even sever thosebeads of yours.' Thereat, O powerful ascetic, with agitatedhearts, the deities fell to propitiating that lord of thecelestials,—and Bhava was pleased with them. And well-pleasedwith them, he conferred this upon those high-souled ones.And even this is that jewel of a bow belonging to thehigh-souled god of gods, and which was ultimately, O lord,consigned as a trust unto our ancestor. And as I was ploughingthe mead, arose a damsel,—and as I obtained her whilehallowing the field (for sacrifice), she hath come to be knownby the name of Sitā. And arising from the earth, she grewas my daughter. And unsprung from the usual source, shewas then established here as my daughter, whose hand mustbe obtained by bending the bow. And O foremost of ascetics,many a king, coming here, had saught to obtain my growingdaughter arisen from the earth. But, O worshipful one,in consideration of her being one whose dower must beprowess in bending the bow. I would not bestow my daughterupon those lords of earth seeking for the damsel. ThereuponO puissant anchoret, all the kings in a body began toflock to Mithilā, desirous of being acquainted with the strengthof the bow. And on their being curious (as to the bow), Ishowed it unto them; but they could neither hold nor wieldit. And, O mighty Muni, finding those powerful kings to bebut endowed with small prowess, I parsed them by. Hearwhat then befell, O thou of ascetic wealth. Then, Opowerful anchoret, in high ire, the kings, doubtful as to theirstrength in stringing the bow, laid siege to Mithilā. And thosepotent princes, conceiving themselves as frustrated by me,began to harass the city of Mithilā, waxing wondrous wroth.And when a year had been completed, my defensive resourceswere entirely exhausted,—and at this, I was exceedinglyaggrieved. Then I sought to propitiate the deities; and well-pleased, the celestials granted me a Chaturanga army.At length those wicked kings, meeting with slaughter, brokeand fled in all directions, together with their adherents,bereft of vigor, and confidence in their strength. And, Opuissant ascetic, this highly effulgent bow will I show untoRāma and Lakshmana, O thou of excellent vows. And, if,O ascetic, Rāma succeeds in fixing string to it, I will conferupon Daçarātha's son my daughter Sitā, unsprung from theusual source.\""

Thelearned consider bridal celebrated on the day succeedingthose on which the Phalgunis are on the ascendant,—andhaving for its presiding deity Bhaga—as the most auspicious.\"Having said these amiable words, king Janaka arose, andwith clasped hands addressed both the foremost of ascetics,saying,—\"I have reaped high religious merit (by thesenuptials), and I also am your disciple. And do ye, ye anchorets,occupy these best of thrones, (belonging to us). And evenas this kingdom is unto Daçarātha, is Ayodhyā untomyself. Do ye not therefore entertain any doubts as to yourlordship. Do ye therefore do as it behoveth ye.\" And asVaideha Janaka was speaking thus, Raghu's son, kingDaçarātha, well pleased answered that monarch, saying,—\"Countless are the excellences that pertain to yebrothers, lords of Mithilā\"; and saints and sovereigns areever honored by ye,99 auspiciousness be yours. Goodbetide ye, I will repair unto my own quarters, there to dulyperform the Srāddha ceremonies.\" Then having greeted thatking of men, the illustrious Daçarātha, placing those foremostof ascetics in his front, went away. And reaching his quarters,the king performed the Srāddha according to the ordinance,arose the next morning, and completed Godana ceremonyin consonance with the time. And to Brāhmanas the monarchseverally gave away kine by hundreds and by thousands, forthe welfare of his sons. And that puissant one gave awayunto the regenerate ones four hundred thousands of kinefurnished with horns plated with gold, and each having hercalf,—together with bell-metal vessels for milking them. Andthat descendant of Raghu addicted to his sons made presentsof various other valuables unto the Brāhmanas, on behalf ofhis sons. And having given away kine, the king surroundedby his sons looked like unto the amiable Prajāpati100surrounded by the Lokapālas."

May she be ofexalted piety, and devoted to her husband; everfollowing thee like thy shadow!\" saying this, the king sprinkledRāma's palm with water sanctified with mantras; with thecelestials and saints exclaiming,—\"Excellent! Excellent!\"And the celestial kettle-drums sounded, and blossoms beganto shower down copiously. Having thus given away hisdaughter Sitā, with water and mantras, king Janakaoverflowing with delight, said,—\"Come forward, O Lakshmana, goodunto thee.

And when Viçwāmitra had goneaway, king Daçarātha, greeting Mitbila's lord, Vaideha,actively prepared for setting out for his own capital. Andthen the king of the Videhas gave a dower consisting ofvarious things. And Mithilā's lord gave many hundredthousands of kine, and excellent woolen stuffs, and Kotis ofcommon cloths; and elephants, and horses, and cars, andfoot men, as well as an hundred damsels adorned,endowed with elegance, to form goodly waiting-maids. And well-pleased the king gave as a noble dower gold and silverand pearls and coral. And having given divers kinds ofarticles, that king, the lord of Mithilā, bidding adieu to themonarch (Daçarātha), re-entered his own capital. And themaster of Ayodhyā accompanied with his high-souled sons,and headed by the saints in a body, started on the journey,followed by his army and attendants. And as that tiger-likeone was on his way, in company with Rāghava and the saints,the fowls began to utter frightful cries all around, and thebeasts on earth to stream in a Southern direction. Andbeholding them, that tiger like monarch asked Vasishtha, saying,—\"Those birds of fierce aspects emit frightful cries and beastsstream in a Southerly direction. What is this? My hearttrembleth and my mind is not at ease.\" Hearing the speechof king Daçarātha, that mighty saint spake sweetly,saying, \"Hear what would be the result of it. These fowls ofthe air by their cries presage some dreadful impending evil;but these beasts betoken peace restored. Therefore do thourenounce anxiety.\" And as they were thus conversing, thereblew a strong wind, shaking all the earth, and breaking downthe trees. And a deep gloom enveloped the sun; and noquarter could be discovered. And enveloped in ashes, thathost became stupified. And at that dreadful hour, Vasishthaand the other saints and the king with his sons alone retainedtheir senses, all else were deprived of their senses, and thearmy was enveloped with ashes. And the king saw thatrepressor of kings, the decendant of Bhrigu, Jamadagni's son,dreadful to behold, wearing a head of matted locks,irrepresible like unto Kailāça, and unbearable like unto thefire at the universal dissolution, flaming fn energy,incapable of being looked at by the unrighteous, with hisaxe on his shoulder, equipped with a bow like unto thelightning, and fierce arrows, looking like Sivā the slayer ofTripura. And beholding him of dreadful appearance likeunto flaming fire, the Vipras headed by Viçwāmitra, engagedin reciting mantras and offering oblations unto the fire,—those saints assembled together—began to converse witheach other., saying,—\"Is this one, enraged because of theslaughter of his sire, intent upon exterminating theKshatriyas? Formerly, having slaughtered the Kshatriyas, hepacified his ire and mental ferment,—therefore, toannihilate the Kshatriyas once again can never be his endeavour.\"Having said this, the saints offered Arghya unto Bhrigu'sson of dreadful appearance; and addressed him in soothingwords, saying,—\"O Rāma!

Do thoustretch it, fix the arrow upon this mighty and dreadful bow,belonging to Jamadagni; and thus display thy prowess.Then, having witnessed thy might in stretching the bow, Ishall offer thee combat, laying under contribution our utmoststrength.\" Hearing his words, king Daçarātha with a blankcountenance, and clasped hands, said,—\"Thou hast quenchedthy ire against the Kshatriyas; and, moreover, thou art aBrāhmana boasting of high austerities. It therefore behoveth theeto dispel the fears of my sons who are boys. Thou bringestthy life from the race of the Bhargavas engaged in observingvows, and studying the Veda; and thou hast renounced armsvowing in the presence of the thousand-eyed one. Andembracing a life of righteousness, thou didst confer theearth upon Kāçyapa; and repaired to the forest, making theMahendra hill thy home.

And, one of these, O foremost of men, forthe destruction of Tripura, the celestials gave unto Tramvaka,desirous of encounter,—even that which, O Kākutstha,thou hast snapped. And this second, which is irrepressible,was given to Vishnu, by the chiefs of the celestials. And,O Rāma, this bow belonging unto Vishnu, capable of conqueringhostile cities, is, O Kākutstha, equal in energy unto thebow belonging unto Rudra. Once on a time the deities, withthe object of ascertaining the respective prowess of Vishnuand the blue-throated one, asked the great father, about it.Thereupon the great father,foremost of those abiding by truth—reading the intention of the deities, fomented a quarrelbetween them. And upon that quarrel breaking out among thedeities, there took place a mighty contest capable of makingone's hair stand on end, between Vishnu and the blue-throatedone, each burning to beat the other down. Then on Vishnuuttering a roar, Sivā's bow of dreadful prowess became flaccid.And thereupon the three-eyed Mahādeva became moveless.And upon the assembled gods with the saints and the Charanasbeseeching those two foremost of celestials, they becamepacified. And upon beholding that bow of Sivā renderedflaccid by Vishnu's prowess, the deities with the saintsacknowledged Vishnu as the more powerful. And the enragedRudra of high fame made over the bow along with itsshafts unto the hands of the Rājarshi, Devarata of Videha.And, O Rāma, this bow belonging to Vishnu, capable ofconquering hostile cities, Vishnu consigned to Bhrigu's son,Richika, as a worthy trust. And the exceedingly energeticRichika made over the divine bow unto his son of immeasurableprowess, my sire the high-souled son of Jamadagni.And once on a time, on my sire surcharged with asceticenergy, renouncing the bow, Arjuna, under the influence ofunrighteous sentiment, compassed the death of my father.Thereupon, learning of the lamentable and untoward slaughterof my sire, I from ire, annihilated the Kshatriyas, springingup afresh by numbers, then bringing under sway thewhole earth, I, O Rāma, on the sacrifice being over, conferredit upon the righteous Kaçyapa as Dakshina. Havingmade this gift, I was dwelling in the Mahendra hill equippedwith ascetic energy, when, hearing of thy snapping of thebow, I have speedily come hither. Do thou now, O Rāma,agreeably to the cannon of the Kshatriya morality, takethis excellent and mighty bow of Vishnu, that had belongedto my father and grand-father.

Do thou to-day witness myenergy and vigor.\" Saying this, the enraged Rāghava,endowed with fleet vigor, took up Bhrigu's noble bow,together with the shaft, from his hand.

And in consonancewith the words of my spiritual guide, ever since that time Ihave never spent a night on earth. Even this had beenpromised by me, O Kākutstha. Therefore, O hero, itbehoveth thee not to destroy my course, O descendant ofRaghu. With the speed of the mind shall I now wend myway to the Mahendra, best of hills.

Hail to thee, O vanquisher of foes! And all thesecelestials assembled are beholding thee, of unparalleleddeeds, and without an antagonist in fight.—And, OKākutstha, neither ought I to be ashamed (because of thisdiscomfiture); I have been baffled by the lord himself of the threeworlds. And it behoveth, O Rāma to disengage thispeerless shaft (from the bow), O thou—of noble vows; andon thy shooting the shaft, I shall repair to that foremostof mountains, the Mahendra. When Jamadagni's son, Rāma,had said this, the puissant and graceful son of Daçarāthashot that excellent arrow. And witnessing the destructionby Rāma of his regions earned by his own austerities,Jamadagni's son speedily started for that best of mountains,the Mahendra.

All those four chiefs of men weredear unto him even as four hands issuing from his own body.Yet among them all, the highly energetic Rāma was thefavorite of his sire. He was the foremost of all in everyvirtue, like unto Sayambhu’s103 self in the esteem of creation.Solicited by the celestials wishing for the destruction ofRāvana, he, who is the eternal Vishnu, was born as Rāmain the world of men. And with that son of immeasurableenergy, Kauçalyā looked graceful, even as Aditi, with thatforemost of the celestials, the weilder of the thunder-bolt.He was furnished with grace, and possessed of prowess; andhe did not seek for defects in others in the midst of virtues.That son of Kauçalyā was incomparable on earth and inworth fully equal to Daçarātha himself. He was aye ofquiescent soul; and always preluded his speech with anamiable phrase; and although he might be addressedin a harsh manner, yet he returned no correspondingreply. He was gratified even with a solitary instance ofbenefit; and from freedom of soul did not remember anhundred injuries. In the intervals of martial exercises, healways discoursed with persons of character, or wise men,or the aged, or the virtuous. He was intelligent, andsweet-speeched, and spoke first (to visitors,) and usedgrateful words, and was possessed of prowesss, withal notproud of his mighty native virtue. He never spoke anuntruth; and he was learned; and he rendered homage untothe aged. He felt kindly towards the subjects; and thesubjects on their part held him in dear regard. He was kindto the poor; and he had conquered his anger; and heregarded the Brāhmanas; and he commisserated the wretched;and was versed in morality; and always chastised the wicked;and was pure in spirit; and possessed the thoughts andsentiments of his race; and regarded highly his own Kshatriyaduties; and considered that heaven was to be attained throughthe glory acquired by performing them.

He was congnizant of virtue, profit, and interest;had an excellent memory; and was possessed of genius. Hewas an adept and was well versed in social usages andcustoms. He was lowly; and of close counsel; and used to keepunto himself his purposes; and was resourceful. Neitherhis pleasure nor his displeasure went for naught. He knewthe season of amassing riches, and of giving them away.And he was ardently reverential; and his wisdom neverwavered; and he accepted no improper present; and heused no rough speech.

  "Bālakāndam and Ayodhyākāndam": "Then facing his whole court, that lord of earth, theking, resounding all sides as if with thunder, in a mightyvoice, echoing, and solemn, and like unto the sounds of akettle-drum, spake words fraught with welfare, and capable ofcreating high rapture,and worthy of the attention of all. And intones overflowing with royal signs; and mellifluous; andpeerless; and surcharged with the sentiment of surprise, themonarch addressed the princes, saying,—\"It is known to ye thatthe (people of this) spacious empire now governed by me wasgoverned like unto children by those sovereigns that were mypredecessors. Now it is my intention to bring welfare untothis entire earth worthy of being rendered happy, whichhad been governed by all those sovereigns, Ikshwāku andthe rest. Following the path trod by my predecessors,I have, heedless of my own happiness, to the best of mypower, always protected the people. And under the shade ofthe white umbrella, I effecting the good of the entirecommunity, have brought decrepitude upon my body. Havingattained an age extending over many thousands of years, andlived for a long period, desire rest for this decrepit frame.Bearing in the interests of the people the heavy burden of dutyincapable of being borne by even those that have controlledtheir senses, and requiring (in the bearer) right royal qualities,I have become fatigued. I therefore wish for rest, after in theinterests of the subjects installing my son, with the permissionof all these excellent twice-born ones around me. My worthyson, like unto Purandara himself in prowess—Rāma, theconquerer of hostile cities, hath been born, endowed with allmy virtues. Him, like unto the moon while in conjunction withthe Pushyā constellation—the foremost of those maintainingrighteousness, the chief of men, will I, in the morning with adelighted heart, install as the heir-apparent to the throne.And that auspicious elder brother of Lakshmana107 will makea fit ruler for ye,—yea, the very three worlds mightconsider themselves as having a lord, by possessing him.Through his agency I shall this day bring about the welfareof the world; and shall renounce my toil by reposing in himthe task of government. If what I have devised be meet, andalso recommend itself to ye, do ye accord approval to it,—proposing what I am to do besides this, together with thehow of effecting it. If I have thought thus solely because Ifind delight in it, do ye look about any other way to welfare.For different is the thought of the dispassionate; and byfriction becomes far more efficacious.\"108"

  "Bālakāndam and Ayodhyākāndam": "As the king had said this, the princes, exceedinglydelighted, seconded him even as peacocks dance at sight of amighty mass of clouds showering down rain. Then therearose a pleasant resonance (from the assembly of the potentates;)and next from the vast concourse inspired with highrapture arose an echo generated by their voices, whichseemed to shake the earth. Then being in complete possessionof the views of that one (the king) versed in moralityand interest, the Brāhmanas and the principal personages ofthe army, in company with the citizens and the inhabitantsof the provinces, took counsel together, and becameunanimous,—and, having again revolved the matter individuallyin their mind, spake unto the aged king Daçarātha, saying,—\"O. king, being many thousand years old, thou last becomeaged. Do thou then install Rāma as the heir-apparent tothe throne. We wish to behold the exceedingly Strong andmighty-armed hero among the Raghus, riding a hugeelephant, his countenance underneath an umbrella.\" Hearingthose welcome words .of theirs, the monarch, as if notknowing their minds, asked them, saying,—\"Ye have wished forRāghava, soon as ye have heard my speech. This, ye kings,raiseth my doubts. Do ye, therefore, speak out your mindstruly. Why, while I am righteously governing the earth,do ye wish to see the highly powerful Rāma as the heir-apparent?\" And those high-souled ones together with thecitizens and the inhabitants of the provinces said unto him,—\"O king, many are the virtues of thy son, having for theirobject the welfare of the people. To-day we will recountunto thee in detail the merits making even enemies happyof the meritorious and intelligent (Rāma) resembling acelestial. O monarch, furnished with the choicest qualities, Rāmahaving truth for prowess is like unto Sakrā's self; and hetowereth above Ikshwāku and all. Rāma is the one excellentperson among men; and is true and devoted to truth. Andin very Rāma is established morality with prosperity.Touching the good of the subjects, he is like unto the moon, andin the quality of forgiveness, he is like unto the Earth; inintelligence like unto Vrihaspati; and in prowess like Sachi'slord. He is cognizant of duty, and true in promise,—and honest; and not given to detraction. He isforgiving, and soothing, and sweet-speeched and grateful,and of subdued senses. He is pliable to entreaties and staid,and of agreeable carriage, and uncalumniating. Rāghavaspeaketh everyone fair, and is of truthful speech. Heminstereth unto variously-versed aged Brāhmanas. It isfor this that in this world his fame and renown and energy goon increasing. He hath mastered all the weapons thatare extant among the gods, the Asuras, and human beings.He hath performed his ablutions after having acquiredlearning; and knoweth the Vedas with their branches. AndBharata's elder brother is a proficient in music. He isthe home of the good, and is saintly, and hath conquered hisgrief, and is magnanimous. He is lowly unto those twiceborn ones that are worthy and are conversant with moralityand interest. And when in company with Sumitrā's son hewendeth to the fight with the view of protecting a city or aprovince, he cometh not back without conquering the foe.And even as a father enquireth after the welfare of his sons,he, returning from the field on horse or elephant, exhaustivelyand consecutively enquireth after the weal of the citizens,concerning their sons, or their (sacrificial) fire, or theirwives, or their servants, or their disciples. And that tiger-like Rāma always asketh the Brāhmanas,—'Do your disciplestend you' and the Kshatriyas—'Do your disciples alwaysremain mailed?' When calamity befalleth the people, heexperienced excess of sorrow; and on their festal occasions,he rejoiceth ever like their own father. He speakeththe truth, and is a mighty bowman. He ministerethunto the aged, and hath controlled his senses. He.preludes his speech with a smile, and is established inrighteousness with his whole soul. He entirely bringeth aboutgood, and he taketh no delight in bandying words after aquarrel. In reasoning in chain, he is like unto the lordof speech himself. His eye-brows are graceful; and hiseyes expansive and coppery; and he is like unto the veryVishnu. Like Kāma he is charming unto all by virtue of hisheroism, prowess and might. He is ever engaged inprotecting the people: and the desire for the good thingsof the world cannot perturb his mind. He is capableof bearing the burden even of the three worlds,—what thenis this Earth? Neither his pleasure nor his displeasureeven goeth for naught. He slayeth those that deserveto be slain; but he is never enraged with those thatought not to be slain (i.e. the unoffending),—with whom,he is pleased, he bestows wealth upon. In virtue of hisself-control and other qualities; dear unto the subjects andcapable of exciting the delight of mankind, Rāma shinetheven like the effulgent Sun surrounded by his rays. Andeven that Rāma, crowned with such qualities and havingtruth for his prowess,—like unto a Lokapāla, the Earthwisheth to have for her lord. By our good luck it is that thyson hath acquired competence in the task of administration;and also by thy good luck it is that Rāghava hath beenborn endowed with sonly qualities, like unto Maricha’sson Kāçyapa. The gods, and the Asuras, and men, with theGandharvas, and the Uragas, and the inhabitants rural andurban, pray for the strength, health, and long life of self-knowingRāma. And whether inmates or outsiders, citizensor natives of provinces, everyone speaks high of him.Women, old and young, in both the morning and evening,with intent minds, bow down unto all the gods on behalfof the intelligent Rāma. Let their desire, O worshipful one,be fulfiled, through thy grace. And we would behold the sonof the foremost of monarchs, the foe-destroying Rāmadark-blue like a lotus,—installed as the heir-apparent to thekingdom. Therefore, O bestower of boons, it behoveth thee,for the sake of our well-being, with a delighted mind tospeedily instal thy son furnished with noble qualities resemblingthe god of gods, and ever intent upon the welfare of theentire community.”"

Doye now prepare for the installation of Rāma.\" When theking paused, there arose a mighty tumult from themultitude. And when it subsided, that lord of men, theking, addressed that foremost of ascetics, Vasishthasaying,—\"It behovcth thee, O worshipful Sir, to orderfor things, necessary for the installation of Rāma.\"Hearing those words of the monarch, Vasishtha—chief ofanchorets—ordered the counsellors staying before the kingwith clasped hands, saying,—\"Do ye early in the morning inthe Agnihautric ball of the monarch provide and store up-gold, and gems, and articles for worship, and Sarvaushadhi109and white garlands, and fried paddy, and honey and clarifiedbutter in separate vessels, and cloths fresh from theloom, and a car, every kind of weapons, and the fourfoldforces, and an elephant with auspicious marks, and acouple of chowris, and a sceptre and an umbrella, palecolored, and an hundred furnished golden pitchers of water,and a bull with horns plated in gold, and an entiretiger-skin, together with all othet necessary articles. Anddo ye embellish all the door-ways of the inner apartment aswell as those of the entire city with garlands, with sandalpaste and fragrant Dhupa. Do ye on the morningof the morrow bestow upon the principal Brāhmanasgoodly and refined rice mixed with curds and milk.—so thathundreds of thousands may be fed, and gratified, bestowingon them at the same time clarified butter and curds, andfried paddy, and moire than sufficient Dakshinas. To-morrowas soon as the sun will rise, the Swastivachana110 will befinished. Do ye invite the Brāhmanas, and prepare seats(for them). And do ye set up flags, and water the high ways,and let courtezans whose profession is music, adorningthemselves stay in the second apartment of the king'sresidence. In the abodes of the gods and under theChaitya111 trees, should be separately placed fragrant blossoms,together with boiled rice and other edibles, and withDakshinas. And let the warriors properly arrayed, enter thecourtyard of the monarch which is welling up with festal gleemailed, and accoutred with leather fences and long swords.\"Having issued these orders, those two Vipras entered upontheir work (as priests;) and did what remained to be doneafter making that known unto the lord of the earth. Wheneverything had been got ready those foremost of the twice-born ones gladly and well-pleased presented themselvesbefore the master of the earth, and said unto him,\"Everything as ordered has been done.\" Then unto Sumantra, theeffulgent monarch spake, saying,—\"Do thou speedily bringthe virtuous Rāma hither.\" Thereupon saying, \"so be it,\"Sumantra at the mandate of the king brought thither in acar Rāma the foremost of car-warriors. The kings of theNorth, and the South and the East and the West, togetherwith the Mlechas and the Arya princes, with thoseinhabiting mountains and forests were then payinghomage unto him (Daçarātha) even as the celestials dounto Vāsava. Stationed in his palace, the royal saintDaçarātha in the midst of those princes, like Vāsava in themidst of the Maruts, saw his son, resembling the king of theGandharvas, approach, gladdening the subjects like a shower,when they were oppressed with the heat of summer—evenRāma of redoubtable prowess among men, long armed, andof mighty strength, and bearing the gait of a mad elephant,\"with a countenance fair as the moon, of presence prepossessingto a degree, and captivating men's sight and hearts byreason of his beauty generosity and other qualities.

  "Bālakāndam and Ayodhyākāndam": "Making Rāghava descend from that excellent car,Sumantra followed him with clasped hands as he proceededto the presence of his father. Accompanied with Sumantra,Rāghava, the descendant of the Raghus, for the purpose ofbeholding the monarch, began with rapid steps, to ascendthe palace resembling a peak of the Kailāsa hill. Rāmahumbly approaching his father with clasped hands, andannouncing his name bowed low and worshipped his father'sfeet. Thereupon seeing Rāma at his side with clasped hands,and in lowly guise, the king took hold of Rāma's claspedhands, and drawing his beloved son, embraced the latter.Then the king desired Rāma to sit upon a seat preparedexpressly for him, excellent, and flaming and garnishedwith gold and gems. Rāghava shed lustre on that noble seat,as the unclouded sun at his rising lighteth up the Sumeruhill with his rays. That entire assembly looked beautifulin his presence, like the cloudless, autumnal sky crestedwith stars and planets, in the presence of the moon. Theking experienced delight, beholding his dearly belovedson, like unto his own image, richly adorned, reflected onmirror. And even as Kaçyapa addresseth Indra of thecelestials, the king—the best of those possessing sons—addressed his son, well seated, in these words, saying. \"Bornof my eldest wife worthy of myself, thou crowned with thebest qualities, art my worthy son, O Rāma dear unto me.Thou hast by thy virtues drawn unto thyself the heartsof the people, therefore do thou during the conjunction ofthe moon with the Pushyā constellation, receive the officeof heir-apparent. Thou art by nature crowned with virtues.Notwithstanding thy great virtues, I will, 0 son, from affectiontell thee what is for thy profit. Practicing greater humility,do thou constantly restrain thy senses. Do thou renounce theills that come through anger and lust. Replenishing thyexchequer and arsenal do thou, acquainting thyself with thestate of things personally and otherwise, administer justiceand thereby enlist the affection of the courtiers and othersubjects; for the friends of him that swayeth the earth,pleasing the people to his satisfaction, rejoice even as didthe immortals on obtaining ambrosia. Therefore, do thou,O son, disciplining thyself thus address thee to thy task.\"Hearing this, Rāma's well wishers, ever doing his pleasure,speedily going out, acquainted Kauçalya with everything.Thereupon that foremost of her sex Kauçalya ordered goldand kine and various kinds of gems to be given to the tellersof the glad tidings. Then Rāghava, having been honored bythe multitude and saluted the sovereign, ascended a car,and repaired unto his shining residence. And the citizens,hearing those words of the monarch, as if fraught with somespeedy good fortune unto them, made their obeisance untothat lord of men, and repairing to their homes, with delightedminds, worshipped the gods."

And hisconclusion was even this: \"To-morrow the Pushyā will be in; andto-morrow should my son, Rāma of eyes like lotus-leaves beinstalled as heir-apparent.\" Then entering the innerapartment king Daçarātha said unto the charioteer Sumantra,—\"Do thou again bring Rāma hither.\" In response to thosewords, the charioteer again speedily went unto Rāma'sresidence,for bringing him thither. His fresh approach havingbeen announced unto Rāma by the warders, the latter, filledwith apprehension, became anxious. And bringing Sumantrain, Rāma with eagerness said \"Tell me fully the reason ofthis thy fresh visit.\" Thereupon, the charioteer told him,—\"The sovereign wisheth to behold thee. Thou hast knownthe occasion; and now decide whether thou wilt go thitheror not.\" Hearing the charioteer's speech, Rāma also inhaste repaired unto the king's palace, with the view ofagain beholding the lord of men. And on hearing of Rāma'sarrival, king Daçarātha made him enter his own chamber,with the view of communicating unto him somethingexceedingly agreeable. Aud immediately on enteringhis father's residence, the graceful Rāghava seeing his fatherfrom a distance, bent low with clasped hands. Thereuponraising Rāma as he was bending down, and embracing him,and pointing out a seat, the protector of the earth againspake unto him,— \"O Rāma, enjoying at my will the goodthings of life, I have grown old; and have attained greatage. I have worshipped the deities by celebrating hundredsof sacrifices with numerous Dakshinas and gifts of boiledrice; and incomparable on earth, thou hast been bornunto me for a son after my heart. I have given whateverbad been wanted (by others); I have finished my studies,O foremost of men. I have, O hero, acted and enjoyed.I have been emancipated from my obligations unto thecelestials and saints, and the Pitris, and the Vipras, andmyself.112 And naught now remaineth to be done by mesave thy installation. Therefore it behoveth thee to do evenwhat I say unto thee. To-day the subjects in a body haveexpressed their desire of having thee for their sovereign.Therefore, O son, I shall install thee as the heir-apparent.O Rāghava, to-night I have dreamt inauspicious dreams.Stars with tremendous sounds, shoot by day, accompaniedwith thunder-claps. The astrologers say that the star of mylife hath been invaded by those terrible planets, the Sun,Mars, and Rāhu. It generally happens that when suchsigns manifest themselves, the king cometh by a terriblecalamity, and may meet with death itself. Therefore, ORāghava, my thoughts change, be thou installed (in thekingdom), for fickle is the mind of all creatures. To-day,before meeting Pushyā, the moon, has entered the Punarvasuasterism; and the astrologers say that to-morrow it willcertainly be in conjunction with Pushyā. My hearturgeth me to instal thee during the Pushyā conjunction, soOh! afflicter of foes, I shall instal thee to-morrow as heir-apparent. Therefore do thou along with my daughter-in-lawcommencing from sun-set, serving the prescribedrestrictions, and lying down on a bed of Kuça grass, spendthe night in fast. And let thy friends vigilantly protectthee all around, for many are the impediments that happenin affairs like this. In my opinion, during the intervalthat Bharata is away from the city, should thy installationbe effected most opportunely; even though thy brotherBharata ever stayeth entirely by the course of the honest;he followeth his elder brother; and is righteous-souled;tender-hearted; and of subdued senses. But in my opinion,the hearts of men are inconstant,—and, O Rāghava, the heartseven of the virtuous change by the action of the naturalimpulses.\" Having been thus addressed in the matter of hiscoming installation in the next day, Rāma, with the king'spermission embodied in \"Go thou,\" greeting his father,repaired unto his quarters. And entering his residence inthe interests of the installation ordered by the monarch, heimmediately issued out, and went to the inner apartment ofhis mother. There, Rāma found his mother in the temple,clad in silk, adoring the gods, and silently praying for hisroyal luck. There, hearing of the welcome installation ofRāma, had already come Sumitrā, and Lakshmana and Sitāsummoned (by Kauçalyā). Hearing of the installation of hisson in the office of heir apparent during the influenceof the Pushyā, at that time, tended by Sumitrā andSiti and Lakshmana, there stood Kauçalya, meditatingthe (triune) person Janārddana, through suspension ofbreath. Rāma, approaching and saluting her engaged inauspicious observance, addressed her in excellent words,cheering her up,—\"O mother, by my father have Ibeen appointed to the task of governing the people. And,agreeably to the desire of my father, to morrow willtake place my installation. To-night Sitā will fastalong with me. The priests have said thus; and thisalso hath been declared by my father.

Thouart my second self; and this good fortune hath taken possessionof thee (as well). Do thou, O Sumitrā’s son, enjoyevery desirable thing and the privileges pertaining to royalty.My life and this kingdom I covet for thy sake alone.”Having said this unto Lakshmana, and paid reverence untohis mother, Rāma with their permission went with Sitā tohis own quarters."

And that foremost of ascetics, havingreadied Rāma’s sable hued residence resembling a mass ofclouds, passed through three several apartments, mountedon the car. With the view of honoring the saint worthyof honor, Rāma swiftly issued out of his abode. Andnearing the car of that intelligent one, Rāma, personallytaking him by the hand, made him descend. Finding Rāmaso humble and dear, the priest addressed him, gratifying anddelighting him with words that were acceptable,—“O Rāmathy father hath been well pleased with thee; since thouachievest the kingdom (through him).

Eagerlyexpecting the investiture of Rāma as the heir apparent,all having thus ornamented the city and assemblingthemselves on terraces and in council-halls, talking witheach other, extolled the lord of men, saying,—\"Ahhigh-souled is this king—the perpetuator of the Ikshwākurace; for, knowing himself as old, he will install Rāma inthe kingdom. Obliged we have been, since good Rāmacapable of reading character, will be the lord of earth, andour protector. He is of a heart devoid of arrogance, andis learned; and righteous-souled; and affectionate to hisbrothers. Rāghava loveth us even as he doth bis ownbrothers. May the sinless and pious king Daçarātha livelong; for it is through his grace that we shall behold Rāmainstalled. The inhabitants of the provinces, who havingheard the tidings, had come from various regions, heard thecitizens conversing thus. Desirous of beholding theinstallation of Rāma, they coming into the city from variousdirections, filled Rāma's city. As the vast concourseentered (the city), there was heard an uproar like untothe roaring of the heaving ocean during the fullness ofthe moon.

I do not find theewith countenance fallen and sore distressed with grief.\" Thehump-backed Mantharā, skilled in speech, who really soughtKaikeyi's welfare, hearing the latter' s sweet-accented words,displaying sorrow greater than Kaikeyi's own, lamenting,and enlisting Kaikeyi's feelings against Rāma, uttered wordsinflamed with anger, saying,—\"O worshipful one, anenduring and terrible destruction is imminent unto thee. KingDaçarātha will install Rāma as heir-apparent. I have beensunk in a fathomless fear; and am afflicted with grief andheaviness. And as if burning in fire I, seeking, thywelfare, have come unto thee. For, O Kaikeyi, great waxeth mygrief on witnessing thy sorrow; and my advancementprogresseth along with thine. There is no doubt aboutthis. Born in a race of king thou art the queen of thislord of earth. Why dost not thou then realise thesternness of royal morality. Thy maintainer speakethmost morally; but is crafty for all that: he speakethblandly, but hath a crooked heart. Him thou takest as ofblessed condition; and therefore art gulled. Speakingunto thee soft words bare of substance, he will, his heart onthe alert, to-day compass the welfare of Kauçalyā. Havingsent Bharata unto the home of thy relatives, that wicked-minded one will establish Rāma in his ancestral kingdomrid of its thorn.

Even what is done by anenemy or a serpent left alone, is being done by Daçarāthaof wicked ways and false soothing speech, unto thee andthy own son. And, O girl, deserving as thou art ofhappiness, the king having established Rāma in the kingdom;thou wilt be annihilated along with thy own. The time hathcome, O Kaikayi,—do thou on the spur enter upon that whichwould turn to thy advantage. And, O thou, influenced bysurprise, do thou deliver thyself, me and Bharata also.\""

Thinking of this, I am pressed downwith sorrow, because fear proceeds from the person who fearsmuch. The mighty armed Lakshmana hath for certain inall ways taken refuge in Rāma; and Satrughna like untoLakshmana hath taken refuge in the Kākutstha, Bharata. Withreference to gradation of birth, the probability is in favor ofBharata's attempting the kingdom; yet by reason (of Rāma'sbeing the elder) of the two, Bharata hath been thrown off.Anticipating the peril that might spring unto thy son fromRāma, learned and versed in the functions of the Kshatriya,and of quick decision, I tremble. Surely Kauçalyā is of blessedfortune, for to-morrow under Pushyā the foremost of the twice-born ones will install her son as the mighty heir-apparentunto the empire.

Rāghava willbecome king, and after Rāghava his son,—so that, OKaikeyi, Bharata will come to be at once cut off from theroyal line. O emotional one, surely all the sons of theking do not obtain the kingdom. And if all were placedon the throne, mighty would be the disturbance therefrom.Therefore it is that kings, O Kaikeyi, lay the task ofGovernment on the eldest son if worthy, or else upon ayounger most meritorious. This thy son, O affectionate one,cast off from the royal race, and deprived of happiness,will fare like one forlorn. Thou dost not understand thatit is for thee that I am taking such pains; and it isevident that thou dost not understand that I have cometo thee for thy good. Thou art conferring on me rewardson the advancement of thy co-wife. For certain, Rāmahaving attained the kingdom without let, will send Bharataeither to a distant land, or to the other world. Bharatais a mere boy, and by thee it is that he hath been sent untohis maternal uncle's mansion. Even in immobile objectsattachment grows by virtue of nearness. Satrughna alsoever following Bharata hath gone with him. He is attachedunto Bharata as Lakshmana is attached unto Rāma. It isheard that once upon a time the woodmen had intended to cutdown a tree; but it was relieved from the high peril becauseof the proximity of prickly shrubs around it. Sumitrā'sson protects Rāma and Rāghava protects Lakshmana.Their fraternal love like that of the Aswins is celebratedin the world. Therefore Rāma will never do any wrongunto Lakshmana; but he will do wrong unto Bharata, thereis no doubt about this. Therefore let that son of Raghube sent unto the woods from the palace. This pleasethme; and this also is for thy supreme welfare; and inthis wise also will be realised the good of thy relations.But if Bharata can get at his ancestral kingdom by justmeans, that would also be welcome to thy kindred.

Therefore it behoveth thee to save Bharataabout to be overcome by Rāma, like a lion pursuing theleader of an elephant herd in a forest. Thy co-wife, Rāma'smother, had formerly through pride and good fortune beenslighted by thee. Why will not she upon thee wreak herrevenge now? When Rāma will obtain the earth furnishedwith many oceans and mountains, then, O proud dame,thou rendered forlorn, wilt along with Bharata, sustain sorrydiscomfiture.

O Kaikeyi, consider: Listen to my words,telling thee how thy son alone will obtain the kingdom. Dostthou not remember, O Kaikeyi, or concealest althoughremembering, wishing to hear from me of the means for thy welfarewhich thou thyself hadst before communicated unto me?

That unreproved one gave battle unto Sakraaccompanied by the celestials. And in that mighty conflict theRākshasas during the night used to drag by main force personsasleep having their bodies cut all over, and kill them. ThenKing Daçarātha warred with the Asuras most heroically. Andthat mighty armed one, O worshipful lady, losing his sensesin consequence of wounds received from weapons, wasremoved from the field by thee. In that imminent danger, thyhusband, sadly cut by weapons, was preserved by thee.Thereupon gratified, he, O, thou of gracious presence,granted thee two boons. Whereupon thou didst say,—'I shallreceive from my lord the boon whenever I shall wish.'Thereupon that high-souled one said,—'So be it.' I did not knowanything about this, O respected one; and it was thou whodidst formerly communicate this (unto me). And it is becauseI bear affection unto thee that I have not forgotten it. Nowdo thou forcibly make the monarch desist from installingRāma; and ask thy husband for these two boons,—theinstallation of Bharata, and the exile of Rāma into the woods forfourteen years. On Rāma having been banished into thewoods for fourteen years, thy son securing the affections ofsubjects, will be firmly established (on the throne). Enteringthe anger-chamber to day, do thou, O daughter of Açwapati,clad in soiled garment, lie down on the uncovered floor.Do not look at him, nor speak to him aught. Do thou onbeholding the lord of the earth, over-whelmed with grief, weeponly. Thou hast always been the favorite wife of thy husband.Of this I have not the least doubt. For thy sake the monarchcan enter into a flame. He can never anger thee, nor canhe eye thee when angered. For compassing thy pleasurethe king can renounce life itself. Therefore the monarch cannever set aside thy word. O senseless lady, do thou nowreflect upon the strength of thy good fortune. King Daçaratbawill offer thee rubies and pearls and gold and gems of variouskinds; but do not thou bend thy heart to them. Do thou,exalted dame, bring into Daçarātha's recollection the twoboons which he had granted thee at the time of the war betweenthe gods and Asuras, and thou shalt not fail to achievethy objects. And when that descendant of Raghu, raisingthee will go to bestow the boons, do thou then bindinghim fast by oath, unfold unto the monarch the boons,saying,—'Send Rāma unto the forest for nine and five years, and letBharata, becoming on earth the foremost of monarchs, carryon the Government.' And Rāma having been banished forfourteen years, thy son growing (in the interval) firm and fast,will remain (on the throne) during the rest of his life. Dothou, therefore, O worshipful one, demand even the banishmentof Rāma; for by this it is, O damsel, all interests willbe secured unto thy son. Thus banished Rāma will nolonger maintain possession of the hearts of the people; andthy Bharata with his foes put out, will be the king. By thetime that Rāma returns from the forest, thy son, thy prudentson along with his friends, securing the hearts of the peopleexternally and internally, will have been firmly established onthe throne.

Wherefore then, O bashfulone, dost thou like that the illustrious and righteous Rāma,O exalted dame, should reside in the forest for five and nineyears? Why dost thou like that the exceedingly tender Rāmawith his soul established in virtue, should dwell in thewoods, undergoing terrible hardship? Why dost thou, O thouof graceful eyes, wish Rāma, captivating all creatures, andengaged in ministering unto thee, to be banished? Rāmaverily serveth thee far more than doth Bharata; and I do notfind that Bharata regardeth thee more than Rāma. Who will,save that foremost of men, so devotedly minister unto thee,regard thee, enhance thy influence, and do thy will. Not oneof the many thousands of females and the innumerableretainers (in the palace), has been able to fasten reproach uponRāma for real or false misconduct. Soothing all creatureswith a pure heart, that great soul by means of good officerssecureth the affections of the inhabitants of the kingdom.He conquers all the twice-born ones by gifts; and that heroconquers his superiors by ministrations; and his enemiesby encountering them with the bow. For certain, inRāghava are truth and charity, and asceticism,and self-renunciation,and friendship, and purity, and sincerity, and learning,and the disposition to tend his superiors. How, O respectedone, canst thou ask for this that will bring thee sin, touchingRāma endowed with candour, and energetic like unto aMaharshi, and resembling a celestial? I do not recollect tohave heard Rāma, who ever speaks sweet words, to have usedany unpleasant speech to any one; how can I then for thy sakeunfold this disagreeable matter unto the beloved Rāma? Andwhat stay have I save him in whom abide forgtveness,andasceticism and renunciation, and verity, and righteousness, andgratitude, and harmless towards all creatures. It behoveththee, O Kaikeyi, to have pity on me, aged and on the verge ofdeath, and afflicted with grief, and distressed, and engagedin lamentations. Whatever can be obtained in this earthbounded by the ocean I will confer on thee—do thou not bringabout my death. O Kaikeyi, 1 clasp my palms, I fall at thyfeet, be thou the protector of Rāma, so that sin may nottaint me.\""

  "Bālakāndam and Ayodhyākāndam": "When the terrible Kaikeyi in still more terrible languageaddressed the mighty king, who was burning in grief, andbewailing, and deprived of his senses, and feeling a sensationof whirling, and overwhelmed with woe, and again and againbeseeching for crossing this ocean of sorrow, saying. \"If, Omonarch, having conferred the boon,thou repentest afterwardshow, O hero, wilt thou speak of thy righteousness in theworld? When,0 thou versed in duty, the Rajarshis assembledaround thee, shall ask thee regarding this matter, what wiltthou answer? Wilt thou say, 'by whose favor do I live and whohad tended me, unto that Kaikeyi have I broken my promise?'Surely, O lord of men, thou wilt bring disgrace unto all themonarchs (of thy line), since having conferred the boons thisvery day, thou speakest otherwise. Saivya granted his ownflesh unto the bird in the matter of the hawk and the pigeon.115And Alarka, having granted his eyes (unto a blind Brahmin)attained excellent state. And the ocean, having boundhimself by promise, never passes beyond his shores. Rememberingthese old stories render not thy promise nugatory. Othou of perverted understanding, renouncing righteousness,and installing Rāma in the kingdom, thou wishest ever to givethyself up to pleasure with Kauçalyā. Whether what I haveproposed be righteous or otherwise, whether thou hast promisedtruly or falsely, swerve not from thy word. If thou installRaima, this very day drinking poison, I will surely die beforethee. If I for a single day behold Rāma's mother receivinghomage rendered with clasped hands, I will consider deatheven as welcome, O lord of men, by Bharata's self dear untome as my own life, I swear that save the exile of Rāma,nothing shall satisfy me.\""

  "Bālakāndam and Ayodhyākāndam": "Having said this, Kaikeyi paused; and maintainedsilence disregarding the bewailing monarch. The king withhis senses overwhelmed with grief, hearing Kaikeyi'sexceedingly bitter words, reflected on Rāma's abode inthe woods, and the advancement of Bharata, and beingbewildered for a while spoke not unto Kaikeyi; but gazedsteadfastly at that exalted dame, his beloved wife, whohad uttered disagreeable things. And having heard thatspeech resembling a thunder-bolt, and unpleasant tothe heart, and surcharged with grief, the king was extremelypained. Then recollecting that revered lady's resolve,and his own terrible oath, he, sighing forth,—\"O Rāma,\"dropped down like a felled tree. And then that masterof the earth being deprived of his sense, was like a madman, or a patient with his faculties wildered, or a serpentwhose energy has been exhausted. In sad and distressfulwords, he addressed Kaikeyi, saying,—\"Who is it that hasconvinced thee that this exceedingly heinous course is aproper one? Dost thou not feel shame to speak thus unto me,like one whose faculties have been possessed by an evilspirit? I did not know before, when thou wast youthful thatthy nature was so perverted; but now I find the very reverseof what I then thought. Whence proceedeth thy fear that thouaskest for such a boon—the establishment of Bharata in thekingdom, and the banishment of Rāma into the woods? Dothou cease to urge such a suit that is fraught with evil untothy wifely virtue, and that will render my word untrue, ifthou wishest for the good of thy husband, of the people, andBharata. O cruel woman; O thou that intendest sinfully, Obase wretch, O doer of impious deeds, how have I and Rāmaconspired against thy happiness; and what offence dost thoufind in us? Bharata will by no means accept thekingdom, depriving Rāma of it, for I consider Bharata a stillmore grounded in righteousness than Rāma himself. WhenI shall say,—\"Repair unto the forest,\" and Rāma'scountenance will fall, like unto the moon overwhelmed by Rāhu, howshall I behold it? How shall I, having in consultation withmy friends come to this decision, retract the same, like untoan army defeated by the enemy? And what will themonarchs coming from various quarters say concerning me,—\"Alas! how has this puerile descendant of Ikshwākureigned so long?' And when many aged folks, endowed withvirtues, and accomplished in various lore will ask meconcerning Kākutstha, what then shall I sav unto them.—'Sorepressed by Kaikeyi, have I banished Rāma? Even if Ispeak this truly, yet none will lend credence to it. And whatwill Kauçalyā say unto me, when Rāma shall have gone tothe forest? Having dpne her this mighty wrong, whatshall I say unto her? Kauçalyā serves me at the same time likea slave, and a friend, and wife, and sister, and mother. Everstudious of my welfare, dearly loving her son, andspeaking every one fair, that exalted lady, although deserving ofhomage at my hands, has up to this time not been regardedby me, because of thee. That I have so long sought thywelfare, afflicteth me now, even like rice partaken by a sickperson with curries that are unhealthful. Beholding Rāmadeprived of his kingdom, and banished unto the forest, whywill Sumitrā alarmed believe in me. Ah! woe to me! Vaidehiwill have to hear of two evil events,—my death andRāma's journey unto the woods. Alas! my Vaidehi,indulging in grief, will renounce her existence, like a Kinnari onthe side of the Himavat, who has been forsaken by herkinnara. When I shall witness Rāma repairing to the mightyforest, and Sitā weeping (in grief) , I shall not hope for a longlife; and thou, becoming a widow, will reign along with thyson. Like unto a goodly liquor, which people havingpartaken it, subsequently find to contain poison, I have foundthee, who had passed for a chaste woman, to be now reallyunchaste. Having soothed me with soft but false words,thou speakest thus. Thou hast killed me like a deer that hasbeen entrapped by a hunter, having been allured into the netthrough the sound of a song. Surely gentle folks will on thehigh-way censure me as one lost to gentility,—as one who hassold his son (for buying his wife's good graces), even like aBrāhmana given to drinking. Alas! alas! having promisedthee the boon, I have to bear these words of thine; and havecome by this grief like unto evil consequent upon misdeedsin a previous existence. Wretch as I am, like a halter setround one's neck, have I, O vile woman, cherished theethrough ignorance. Not knowing thee for my death, I havesported with thee, like an infant dallying in solitude with avenomous snake. Surely, people will be justified in con-demning me wicked-minded that I am, for my son havingbeen deprived of his ancestral kingdom by me; saying,—\"Alas! king Daçarātha is foolish and lustful; for he sendshis beloved son to the woods for the sake of his wife.\" Rāmahas grown emaciated by study ng the Vedas, leading theBrahmācharyya mode of life, and serving his preceptors,—-will he again undergo this mighty toil at this time ofenjoyment? My son is incapable of uttering a second word untome; and commissioned, he will repair to the woods, saying,'Very well.' if ordered with 'Go to the forest,' Rāghavadoes not consent, even that would conduce to my pleasure;but he will do nothing of the kind. And Rāghava havinggone to the forest, Death will surely summon me away to hisabode who am of exceedingly reprehensible character, and whoam universally execrated. And I having been dead and thatbest of men, Rāma, having gone to the woods (I do not know) towhat a plight thou wilt bring my kindreds. And if Kauçalyāloses me and Rāma, and Sumitrā loses her two sons andme and Rāma, then tormented with the extreme of grief,those exalted ladies will follow me. Do thou, O Kaikeyi,casting into hell Kauçalyā and Sumitrā and myself with ourthree sons, attain happiness. Renounced by me as well asRāma, this lkshwaku line existing from a time immemorial,and ennobled by excellent qualities, and incapable of comingby grief, thou wilt rule, when it shall have been overwhelmedwith misfortune. If the banishment of Rāma, be agreeableto Bharata let him not, when I am dead, perform my funeralobsequies. When I am dead, and when that foremost of menhas gone to the forest, do thou, a widow, rule the kingdomalong with thy son. O daughter of a king, when by chancethou residest in my mansion, I must come by signalinfamy and discomfiture in the world, and meet withgeneral disregard, like unto a sinful person. How havingalways gone on cars and elephants and horses, will dearRāma range in the forest on foot? How will my son,at the approach of whose meal-time, cooks wearingear-rings and emulating each other prepare excellentmeats and drinks, pass his days, living on fare furnishedby the woods, of astringent, or bitter, or pungent taste?How will he, who has always been clad in costly attire,and who has always enjoyed happiness, will dwell on thebare earth, wearing a piece of red cloth? From whomhast thou received this inconceivable and dreadful advice,—Rāma's journey to the woods and installation of Bharata?Fie upon women, crafty and selfish! But I must not nameall women—I mean only the mother of Bharata. O thou thatart intent upon doing mischief unto all, O thou addicted toselfishness, O cruel one, has God made thy mind so veryvile, only to torment me? What wrong hast thou come byeither through me, or Rāma ever engaged in thy welfare?On beholding Rāma plunged in sorrow, fathers will forsakesons, and wives attached unto their husbands will forsakethem, and the entire earth will be affected with ill-humour.When I hear him coming, adorned like unto a son of thecelestials, I rejoice on casting my eyes on him, and I feel asif I had regained my youth. Men may do without the Sun,and the wielder of the thunder-bolt not raining, but none, Iapprehend, can live, on witnessing Rāma repairing hence. Ihave kept in my mansion, like unto my own death, thee thatdesirest my destruction, and art intent upon doing me wrong,and art my foe. I have for a long time held thee on mylap, like unto a she-snake of virulent poison; therefore inconsequence of my folly, I now meet with destruction. Nowdissevered from me, and Rāma together with Lakshmana, letBharata govern the city and the kingdom along with thee.Destroying thy relatives, do thou enhance the joy of myenemies. O thou cruelly-disposed, O thou bringer on ofcalamities, since banishing all sense of the relation in whichwe stand to each other as husband and wife, thou hastspoken thus, why reduced to thousand fragments thy teethdrop not from off thy mouth down to the ground? Rāmahas not used any harsh speech towards thee. Indeed Rāmaknows no harsh speech; why then dost thou seek toinflict upon Rāma (ever) pleasant spoken, and endowedwith agreeable qualities—such wrongs. O thou that renderestinfamous the king of the Kekayas, whether thou becomestmiserable, or enterest into fire, or killest thyself (by takingpoison), or divest into the bowels of the earth opened at athousand places, I will not execute thy fell intention that isfraught with evil unto me. I do not wish, that thou, like untoa razor, and ever speaking pleasant falsehoods, and possessedof a vile heart, the destroyer of thy own race,—thou thatwishest to burn my heart and life, thou unbeautiful one,mayst remain alive. My life itself is in jeopardy,—wherethen is my happiness? Where is the happiness of parentswithout their sons? It behoveth thee not, O noble dame,to do evil unto me. I take hold of thy feet; be thoupropitious unto me.\" As bewailing thus like one forlornthe ruler of earth whose heart was captivated by Kaikeyi onaccount of her supreme beauty proceeded to take hold ofher feet, who having banished all self respect, sat withher legs stretched, he, without being able to come at them,fell down in a swoon, like one enfeebled with disease."

It was closedwith two big pannels at the gate way (of which the trap-doorwas flung open), and adorned with hundreds of terraces,on its top were many idols made of gold, and arches crestedwith pearls and diamonds; its colour was white as theautumnal cloud and bright as the golden cave of Sumeru;it was ornamented with highly brilliant jewels set in thegarlands of gold flowers and strewn with pearls and diamondsand sprinkled with sandal and Aguru, the fragrance of whichcaptivates the mind like the summit of the hill Dardura;it was graced with the presence of Sarasas and peacocksemitting pleasant sounds; and covered with well-made figuresof wolves aud pictures of artistic excellence, the splendourof which captivates the mind and the eye as well; brightas the sun and moon, resembling the abode of Kuveraand the capital of the king of the celestials; filled withbrids of various kinds and high as the summit of Sumeru,Sumantra saw the palace filled with people coming fromdifferent quarters with clasped hands, and adorned with citizensapproaching with various presents and eager (to see theinstallation of Rāma; and (standing at the gate) being prevented bythe warders to enter; resembling a huge cloud, of picturesquesituation, spacious, strewn with pearls and diamonds andcrowded with servants. That charioteer, in his chariot withits wooden ledge and horses, beautifying the crowded streetsand pleasing the citizens, entered the abode of Rāma. There-upon arriving at this abode filled with wealth, and having itsbeauty greatly intensified with deers and peacocks, movingto and fro, resembling the exqusitely splendid palace of thelord of the celestials,that charioteer was extremely enraptured,having the hairs of the body erect. Then that charioteerentering several apartments, well adorned and resembling theKailaça hill and the abode of the celestials and passing bymany persons, dear unto Rāma and abiding in his purpose,entered the apartment of the ladies. And he becameexceedingly pleased on hearing pleasant words, meaning well untothe son of the king, from all persons, engaged in some sortof service for the installation. He saw the pleasant abodeof Rāma, resembling that of Mahendra, and filled withdeers and birds, having its top high as the summit ofMeru and situated well in splendour, and the gateway filledwith millions of citizens with clasped hands keeping theirconveyances outside and coming from various quarters withpresents for Rāma. He saw there a wild elephant by thename of Satrunjaya or the conqueror of foes, having a hugeboly resembling a mountain enveloped in dark clouds,beautiful, capable of bearing the goading hook andintended as Rāma's conveyance. He saw well adorned ministersdear unto the king with horses, chariots and elephants; andleaving them all on either side, entered unprevented,like unto the marine monster Makara entering the oceancontaining many pearls and diamonds, the splendidapartment of the ladies, resembling the clouds that hover overthe summit of the Hill Himādri, and having a number ofbeautiful houses comparing with great celestial cars."

They all seeingSumantra, ever wishing good unto Rāma, approach, rosesuddenly up from their seats with due respect. Thebumble-minded charioteer then said to them:—\"Go and speedilycommunicate unto Rāma that Sumantra is waiting at the gate.\"At this the warders, desirous of doing good unto theirmaster, nearing Rāma, speedily comunicated these wordsunto him who was in the company of his wife. Rāma hearingof the arrival of his father's charioteer, ordered him to enterinto the apartment, having his father's pleasure in view. He(on entering) saw Rāma resembling Vaisravana, well adornedand seated on a gold sofa, with a beautiful coverlet on;having his body sprinkled with holy and fragrant sandalof the best kind, red as the blood of a hog; and having byhim Sitā with a chowri in her hand, like Moon himself in thecompany of Chitrā."

I shall be ministering untothee, seeing thee initiated, engaged in ceremonies, wearingexcellent deer skin for cloth and carrying horns in thehands. May Indra protect thee on the East, may Yāma(Death) protect thee on the South, and Varuna (God ofwater) on the West and Kuvera (God of wealth) on theNorth.\" Being greeted with benedictory ceremonies, Rāma,bidding farewell to Sitā, issued out of his house like unto alion, living in the den of a mountain. He saw Lakshmanastanding at the gate with clasped hands, and met all hisfriends assembled at the middle apartment.

It had two excellent horses tied to it likeunto two young elephants, and was of quick motion,resembling that of Indra's chariot carried by his horses. Ascending thecar, Rāghava, of great effulgence, went speedily on, making(the space)resounded like unto the muttering cloud on the sky.He issued out of his abode like the beautiful moon passingthrough a huge cloud. And Lakshmana, the younger brotherof Rāghava, standing behind him on the car with a splendidChowri in his hand, began to guard his body. And there wascaused a great tumult by the crowd gathering around on theissuing out of Rāma. Then followed in his train manyhundreds and thousands of beautiful horses and elephantsresembling hills in their appearance; and went before himhundreds of heroes, well accoutered, and having their bodiessprinkled with sandal and Aguru and holding swords andarms in their hands, and other persons utteringbenedictions. He heard on the way sounds of musicalinstruments, eulogy of the panegyrists and lion-like roarsof the heroes. Exquisitely beautiful damsels, adorned withvarious ornaments and dresses, standing by the windowsbegan to shower flowers upon the head of the foe-destroyerRāma, and those spotless beauties with a view to pleaseRāma,some standing on the buildings and some on the groundbegan to praise him:—\"Oh thou, delight of thy mother,surely has mother Kauçalyā become exceedingly gratified, onseeing thee of successful journey to accept the heir-apparentship of the throne.\" Those ladies thought thatSitā, the captivater of Rāma's heart was surely the bestof all women and for certain had she performed some greatausterities in her past life or else she would not have beenthe companion of Rāma, like unto Rohini, the companion ofMoon. That best among men heard these pleasant wordsfrom those ladies standing on the buildings and on high-ways.Rāghava then heard the people coming from differentquarters and the well-pleased citizens, talking amongst themselvesregarding him in the following strain. \"This Rāghava goingshall obtain through the grace of the king great wealth, andall our desires will be gratified when he will become ourgovernor. It is a great gain to the subjects that he is going to getfor ever the entire empire at once; he being the lord of thepeople, no body shall witness any misfortune or unpleasantthing.\" Like unto Vaisravana he began to proceed, beingdignified by the horses and elephants going before sendingforth great sound, and eulogised in various metres by personssinging his glory, by the panegyrists and by men tracing hisnoble ancestry.

It was a splendidlyspacious road decorated with a collection of sandal, Aguruand other fine scents, with silk and red cloth, with pearlsholed and other valuable crystals and strewn with variousflowers and filled with edibles multiform. Like unto thelord of celestials in heaven he saw this high way and thecourt-yard covered with curd, clarified butter, fried paddy,Dhupa, Aguru and sandal, and embellished with garlandsand other scents. Having heard benedictions uttered bymany in the following strain and paying proper respectsunto all, he wended his way. \"Being installed this day dothou following in the footsteps of thy father and grand-fatherscherish and protect us. Thou taking the reins of governmentwe shall live more happily than what we were under yourancestors.

Andthe son of the monarch, shining in beauty, entered into thepalace of his father, the best on earth resembling the abodeof Mahendra. Daçarātha's son, the best of men, crossed inhis chariot three apartments guarded by warriors with bows intheir hands, and other two on foot, and in this way passingby all, and ordering his followers to go back, entered the innerapartment.

And humbly bowing down at the feet of his fatherfirst, he saluted Kaikeyi with due solemnity. Utteringthe word \"Rāma\" only, the poor king with his eyes full oftears could not eye him nor could he speak to him. Seeingthis unforeseen and terrible appearance of the king, like unto aserpent trampled under foot, Rāma was exceedingly terrified.He was dejected and pulled down much with sorrow andpenitence. He was sighing hot and hard and his heart wasgreatly pained. His heart was troubled like the wavy oceanagitating though incapable of agitation,and clouded like the Sunpossessed by Rāhu, and (that of) an ascetic speaking falsehood.Thinking of this unthought of sorrow of the king he becameagitated like unto the ocean during the course of the full-moon.And clever Rāma, intent on bis father's welfare, thoughtwithin himself:—\"Why does not the king display joy onmy arrival to-day? Angry though, he used to express joywhenever he saw me; then why does his sorrow prevaileven seeing me to-day?\" Being pressed with sorrow, Rāmaof pale countenance, like one miserable, saluting Kaikeyi,spoke unto her the following words. \"Is it not that Icommitted some offence through ignorance that I see my fatherangry? Do thou propitiate him therefore. Why is hismind so aggrieved who was so kind to me, and why does helook poorly and of pale countenance who used to welcome mealways with kind words? Is he subject to any physical ormental disturbance? Oh! happiness uninterrupted isvery dear. Has any evil befallen the good-looking Bharata orhigh souled Satrughana? Is it not all well with my mothers?Dissatisfying the king, disregarding his words and offendinghim, I do not want to breathe for a single moment. Howcan a man disregard him who is god himself seen and felt,and who is looked upon as a cause from whom he has sprung.Oh mother, hast thou spoken any harsh word to my fathereither through anger or through haughtiness for whichhis mind is thus pulled down?

He hasgot something in his mind which he cannot speak out throughthy fear. Thou art his most beloved son and word does notproceed from his mouth to speak thee things unpleasant.

Promising 'I give thee' the lord of earth grantedme these boons; in vain he wishes to set up a dyke when allthe water has passed away. Oh Rāma, it is known to theethat truth is the root of all religion and may he not renouncethat for thee, being angry with me. If do thou carry out allthat the king will speak to thee, good or evil, then I shallrelate unto thee every thing.

Of thesetwo boons I have asked of the king the installation of Bharata,and the departure of Rāghava into the Dandaka foresteven this very day.

I do not think it proper for thee, O Rāma,to delay, when thou art so anxious; it behoves thee thereforeto depart from this place speedily unto the forest.

As long as thou shalt not hurriedlydepart froth his presence, Oh Rāma. thy father shall notbathe, or eat anything.\" 'Oh fie!' 'what affliction' sobbinghard with these words, the monarch, filled with sorrow, swoonedaway and fell down upon the sofa, embellished with gold.Raising the king up, Rāma, being directed by Kaikeyi,began to hurry on his departure to the forest, like unto asteed struck sharp with a whip. Hearing those cruel andunpleasant words of the wicked Kaikeyi, Rāma, not beingdistressed, began to address her with the following words.\"Oh worshipful one, being addicted to wealth do I not longfor living in this world; like unto Rishis, know me, to be wellestablished in pure religion. If I can, even at the sacrificeof my own life, satisfy my worshipful father rest assured it isto be done first in all manner. There is no virtue greaterthan the serving of the father and carrying out his words.Even though not commanded by him, I shall; for thy words,live in a solitary forest for fourteen years. Oh Kaikeyi,certain it is that thou art not acquainted with my foremostvirtues, inasmuch as possessing full authority to rule me, thouhast requested the monarch for this. Excuse me until I askmy mother, and comfort Sitā; even this very day shall I wendmy way unto the great forest of Dandaka. It behoves thee todo that by which Bharata may govern the kingdom and tendour father, for this is the virtue eternal.\" Hearing thesewords of Rāma, his father, greatly afflicted and incapable ofspeaking anything on account of sorrow, began to cryaloud. Worshipping the feet of the king lying insensible,and those of vicious Kaikeyi, that greatly effulgent one wentout. And reverentially going round his father and Kaikeyi,and issuing out of the female apartment, Rāma saw his ownfriends and relatives. Then followed him Lakshmana, theenhancer of Sumitrā's joy, greatly angry and with his eyesfull of tears. Going round with reverence the house ofinstalation full of necessary articles, not turning away fromit his wistful look, Rāma began to proceed slowly. Loss ofkingdom could not diminish the great beauty of that belovedof the people on account of its everlasting pleasantness, likeunto the wane of the moon. There was manifest in him nochange of mind, who was about to fly as an exile to the forestand leave the world, like unto one emancipated while yetliving. Leaving aside the excellent umbrella and well adornedchowries, forsaking his relatives, chariot, citizens and otherpeople, calmly bearing the affliction in mind and notmanifesting the outward signs of sorrow, Rāma, with a view tocommunicate this unpleasant news to his mother, entered herabode. All persons, who were present there and who adornedthemselves on account of the installation, did not percieveany sign of mental agony on the face of Rāma. Like untothe rays of the fully brilliant autumnal moon, that hero ofmighty arms, having control over himself, did not forsake hisnative cheerfulness. The pious Rāma, having high fame,entered into the presence of his mother, manifesting greatregards for the people with sweet speech. Then followedhim, the son of Sumitrā, of mighty prowess, of equalaccomplishments with his brother, and bearing the mental sorrow.Rāma, entering the abode of his mother, saw it filled withall sorts of amusements; and even though his mind was notagitated with any mental disturbance seeing the impendingcalamity of loss of wealth, he was anxious lest the lives of hisdear relatives might be in danger."

'That Rāma, who used to serve all the females inall matters even without his father's permission, who wasour stay and protector, is going to the forest. Rāghava fromhis birth pays as much attention to us as to his motherKauçalyā. He, who being cursed, does not get angry,pacifies the wrathful and studiously avoids words and deedsthat excite anger in others, will repair hence this day untothe forest. Senseless is our king, who forsakes Rāghava whois the stay of all people, and thus kills his subjects.\" Thusthe queens of Daçarātha, like unto the cows that have losttheir young ones, began to blame him and cry aloud.Hearing this terrible uproar of cry in the female apartment, thatlord of earth, racked with sorrow on account of his son, hidhimself in the seat (with head hanging downdards). Rāmatoo, having control over his own self, experiencing sorrow(for his relatives) and sobbing like an (enchained) elephant,entered into his mother's apartment together with his brother.He saw a venerable old man, sitting at the gate and manyother persons. All those present, seeing Rāma, began toshower benedictions on him, the best of all victorious heroes,saying, \"Victory unto thee.\" Having passed through the firstapartment he saw in the second, many old Brahmins, versedin the Vedas and honored by the king. Having bowed downunto them, Rāma saw in the third apartment, women, boys,and old men, all engaged in watching the gate. The femalewarders honored Rāma rejoicing, and entering his mother'sapartment, communicated unto her speedily this pleasantnews. Worshipful Kauçalyā, seeking her son's welfare,kept up the whole night being absorbed in meditation, andwas, in the morning, worshipping the God Vishnu. Wearingsilk-cloth, pleased, and accustomed to the performanceof religious rites every day, she, performing benedictoryceremonies, was offering oblation unto the fire. Rāma enteringthe auspicious abode of his mother beheld her thus engagedin the sacrifice to the fire. The descendant of Raghu sawthere, brought for the service of the celestials, curd, grains,clarified butter, sweetmeats, things fit for oblations unto thefire, fried paddy, white garlands, rice boiled in milk and sugar,rice sesamum and pea mixtures, sacrficial fuels and jarsfull of water. He saw his virtuous mother wearing whitesilk, pulled down by the austere performance of religiousrites, and engaged in propitiating the deities withthe offering of water. She seeing her son, everadvancing the joy of his mother, approach, became pleased,and stepped forward like unto a mare beholdingher young one. Seeing his mother approach, Rāghavabowed low, and (Kauçalyā) embracing him in her arms smelthis head. Kauçalyā, out of motherly affection, spoke thesesweet and beneficient words unto her own invincible son,Rāghava. \"Mayst thou obtain the life and fame of the pious,old Rajarshis, and the virtue worthy of thy family. See, OhRāghava, how truthful is your father the king! That virtuous-souled one shall install thee this day as the heir-apparent ofthe throne.\" Rāghava, humble by nature, who was offered byhis mother a seat and asked by her to eat something,streching forth a little his clasped hands, and with his headdownwards with a view to show respects towards his mother,touched the seat, and began to relate unto her the object ofhis repairing unto the Dandaka forest. \"O worshipful one,certain it is that thou knowest not the great impending calamity.It is for the distress of thine, Lakshmana and Vaidehi, that shallI wend my way unto the Dandaka forest. What is the use ofa seat to me then? Now is the time come when I deserve a seatmade of Kusa grass. I shall live in the forest for fourteen yearsabstaining from animal food and living on tuberous roots andfruits like unto the ascetics. The king shall confer uponBharata the heir-apparentship and shall banish me as an asceticinto the forest. And I shall live in that solitary forest foreight and six years, feasting on roots, and fruits andperforming the duties of a hermit.\" Like unto the stem of a sala treecut asunder by an axe in a wood, like unto a female celestialfallen down from the abode of the gods, she fell downsuddenly (hearing these heart-rending words.) Rāma seeing hismother, who deserved no distress, fall down like a plantaintree and insensible, raised her up, and finding her coveredwith dust all over her body like unto a mare risen up afterrolling on the ground on account of toil of bearing heavy burdenwiped oflf (her body) gently with his hand. She, deservinghappiness, being racked with the destruction of her delightspoke thus unto Rāghava, that best of men, in the presenceof Lakshmana. \"Oh! my son, Oh! Rāghava, hadst thounot been born for my grief I would have been sonless only,but would not have been subject to this greater grief. Asonless woman has only one cause of mental affliction. Heronly sorrow is \"I have no child\" and nothing else my son.I have not experienced in my life that blessing and pleasurewhich women generally feel when their husbands are devotedto them. I have sustained my life so long, O Rāma, onlywith the hope that I shall witness this and other happinesswhen I shall have a son. Myself, being the eldest of all thequeens, shall have to hear unpleasant and heart-rendingwords from the co-wives who are all younger than I. Therecan be no greater misery for women than this my boundlessgrief and lamentations. Thou being present, they havereduced me to this miserable plight, I do not know what elsethey will do, thou being away; there is death certain for me,Oh my darling! Being disregarded by my husband I havebeen greatly insulted—I am equal to the maid-servants ofKaikeyi or even inferior to them. Those who serve me orare obedient unto me, shall not even speak with me whenthey will see the son of Kaikeyi (installed). She is alwaysof fretful temper, how shall I, reduced to misery (on accountof thy exile), eye the face of Kaikeyi, uttering harsh words.I have spent, Oh Rāghava, ten years and seven from thy(second) birth118 expecting a termination of my sorrow. Eventhough worn out, Oh Rāghava, I shall not be able to sufferthis great misery cosequent upon thy unending exile andthe contempt of the co-wives. How shall I, of miserable lifepass my days in grief not seeing thy face, effulgent like untothe full-moon. Wretched as I am, in vain have I brought theeup with fasts, contemplations and many other toilsomeausterities. Surely, I consider my heart is very hard, as it doesnot rend like unto the bank of a great river in contact withnew water in the rainy season. There is no death for me—no vacant place in the abode of Yama; otherwise why doesnot Death take me away like unto a lion snatching away aweeping hind; certain it is that my heart is made of iron, asit does not rend nor does my body being pressed down withthis sorrow and falling) down on earth, break into pieces;verily have I no death before time. This distresses me thatall my religious vows, alms givings, self-restraint and austerity,performed with a view of obtaining a son, have been fruitless,like unto the seeds thrown on a barren soil. If any body inthis life, being pressed down with some great calamity, couldmeet with death of his own accord, I would have instantlygone to the abode of dealh, being cut off from thee like untoa cow from her young one. Oh, thou, having a countenanceof moon-like splendour, wretched indeed is my life withoutthee—I shall follow thee to the forest out of greataffection, like unto an enfeebled cow following her young one.Kauçalyā like a Kinnari unable to bear this great calamity,anticipating some great misfortune and seeing Rāma bound(with a great vow), began to lament in various ways."

The king is uxorious, oldand therefore of perverted judgment and is addicted toworldly affairs; being under the influence of his wife and passionwhat could he not speak? I do not see any such fault orsin in Rāma that he should be banished from the kingdomto range in the wood. I do not find any such man in thisworld, even amongst great enemies, who, forsaken forheinous sins, can cite, even in his absence, any fault of him.Observing what law of righteousness does the monarch,without any cause, renounce such a son who is like unto celestials,simple, well disciplined and beloved even of the enemies?What son, remembering his father's conduct, shall carry inhis heart these words of the king, who has again gone backto childhood? Ere people come to know this proposal ofexile, do thou secure the government of the kingdom untothyself with me.

I shall immolate all whoshall stand by Bharata or wish him well—certainly mildnessbrings about discomfiture. If father being propitiated andexcited by Kaikeyi, turns out to be our enemy, he shall beslain, without any hesitation. Even a spiritual leader deserveschastisement if he is puffed up with pride, and is devoid ofthe power of judging good actions and bad, and when he isgone astray. Tell me, Oh best of men, by what law of virtueand what reason does he purpose to confer this kingdom uponKaikeyi, which has devolved upon thee (by the law ofinheritance). Who dares conferring on Bharata the kingdom,carrying hostility with me and thee? Oh worshipfulone, verily am I attached at heart to my brother. Bytruth, bow, gifts and things dear unto me, do I swear untothee; if Rāma shall enter into the wood, know me, Ohworshipful one, to have entered into the fire before thatLike unto the sun dispelling darkness, shall I remove thysorrow by dint of my power; may your worshipful self andRāghava witness it. Readily shall I despatch my father,whose heart is unduly attached unto Kaikeyi and who istherefore vile and being old contemptibly playing the child.\"Hearing these words of the high-souled Lakshmana, Kauçalyāweeping and being pressed with sorrow spoke these words untoRāma. \"You have heard, Oh my son, what your brotherLakshmana said; and if you like, do what seemsreasonable unto thee. It does not behove thee, hearing thesinful words given vent to by the co-wife, to repair hence,leaving me who is sore distressed with sorrow. Oh thoupious one, having knowledge of religion, if do thou wish toacquire righteousness, serve me here and continue practisingthe best of all virtues. Hear, Oh my son, the great asceticKasyapa, lived in his house, serving his mother continuallyand being crowned with best moral merit reached heaven.As the monarch is worshipful unto thee in veneration soam I. I do not permit thee, to repair hence unto the forest.Separated from thee I do not need life or happiness; withthee I would prefer faring on grass. If do thou depart untothe forest leaving me troubled with sorrow, I shall resort tothe vow of fasting and shall not be able to sustain my life.And then thou shalt receive the penalty of hell, well knownto the people, as did the ocean, the lord of rivers, for like,unrighteousness, suffer the agony of Brahminicide.\"119Whereupon unto his mother Kauçalyā, sorrowful and weeping, spokeRāma, virtuous-souled, these words of righteousness. \"Thereis no power in me to transgress my father's behests; bendlow I my head unto thee—I want to proceed to the forest.The learned Rishi Kandu, who lived in the forest keepingthe word of his father, killed a cow, knowing it to beunrighteousness. In our line the descendants of Sāgara, atthe command of their father, met with signal destruction,while digging the earth. Rāma the son of Jāmadagni, at hisfather's words, decapitated his mother in the forest. Theseand other god-like personages, Oh worshipful one, obeyedheroically the orders of their father; and I shall do my father'swelfare therefore. It is not I alone who am carrying out myfather's commands; those whom I have mentioned now, Oworshipful one, have done so. I am not introducing somesuch righteousness, unfavourable unto thee, that has beennever practised before. I am simply treading the path, thathas been upheld and followed by worthies gone before.Surely shall I accomplish that which is worthy of beingperformed in this world and nothing else—one going by hisfather's behests is not certainly degraded.\""

  "Bālakāndam and Ayodhyākāndam": "Saying these words unto his mother, that best of menversed in speech and best of archers, again spoke untoLakshmana all these words. \"I know full well, OhLakshmana, thy affection towards me and thy power,strength and unconquerable force. Not knowing my setttedconviction in regard to truth and peace, my mother, Ohbeautiful Lakshmana, is so disturbed with incomparablesorrow. Righteousness is the prime object in this world andin righteousness is established truth, and this excellentutterance of my father is in keeping with righteousness. Itdoes not become them, O hero, who abide in righteousness tofail to carry out the commands of father, mother or a Brahmin.While I have been, Oh warrior, ordered by Kaikeyi at myfather's words, I shall not be able to transgress those behestsagain. Do thou relinquish therefore this unrighteous purposeof thine consequent to the virtues of the Kshatriyas; do thouabide by righteousness but not cruelty, and follow mydecision.\" Saying these words unto Lakshmana out of fraternalaffection, spoke again Rāma to Kauçalyā with clasped handsand with his head bending low. \"I do bind thee with an oathof my life, Oh venerable one, to allow me to wander away henceinto the wood. Do thou perform benedictory ceremonies for mywelfare. Like unto the royal saint Yayati in the days of yoreonce falling on earth going again to the abode of celestials,I shall, fulfilling my vows, again return home from the forest.Do thou, Oh mother, assuage thy grief within thy heart;lament not thou, I shall return home again from the woodafter making good my father's words. Myself, Lakshmana,Vaidehi, Sumitrā and thyself shall abide by father's words,and this is the virtue eternal. Desisting from the ceremoniesof installation and allaying thy sorrow in thy heart do thou,Oh my mother, follow my pious decision about retiring to theforest\". Hearing those pious, sober and reasonable words ofRāma, the venerable mother, regaining her sense like untothe dead, and casting her look upon him, spoke to him againthe following words. \"I am equally worshipful unto thee,Oh my son, with your father, for like him have I brought theeup with pains and like him do I love thee. I shall not allowthee to repair unto the forest and it does not behove theeto go leaving me behind sore distresssd with grief. Withoutthee, of what avail to me is my life, my relatives, the worshipof the manes and the deities and the knowledge of divine truthon this earth? Prefer do I thy company even for a moment tothe presence of all creation.\" Hearing these sorrowful wordsof his mother, Rāma was again inflamed with ire, like unto anelephant goaded with a fire-brand, when entering into darkness.He, abiding in righteousness spoke such pious words unto hismother, almost insensible, and unto the son of Sumitrā,bewailing and racked with sorrow, as he was justified to utteron that occasion. \"I know, Oh Lakshmana, thy deeprespects unto me and thy power. It is not proper for thee topain me along with my mother, not being cognizant of myintention. Righteousness, wealth, and the objects of desireare looked upon with great esteem in this world of the createdbut when the occasion for obtaining the result consequentupon the virtuous deeds of a prior life appears, all these three,I have no doubt, are fulfilled in righteousness, as the wifealone, obedient, charming and having a son (fulfils them all).It is not becoming for us to perform all those things wherethese three do not combine—whence results righteousnessthat we should resort to. A man seeking wealth becomesdespicable, and one subject to desires is not admired by any(when bereft of righteousness). Who of us, having notendency to wickedness, shall not obey the command ofour father knowing it to be righteousness, who is old, ourmonarch and preceptor in military training, be it an outcomeof his desires, anger or joy. For this it is that I am unableto act against my father's vow—he is our father andtherefore can command us both like a master; and he is thehusband of this venerable one, therefore her stay andrighteousness itself. The righteous monarch is still living andcontinues in his own path when ready to redeem his vow evenby renouncing me—how can this worshipful one accompanyme like other insignificant widows? Do thou permit metherefore, to repair unto the forest and perform benedictoryceremonies for me so that I may again return home like untoYajati regaining heaven by truth. I cannot neglect eminentfame being impelled by avarice for kingdom alone. Life isbut of short duration, Oh worshipful one, and as such I donot long for acquiring this nether earth by means unrighteous.\"Rāma, that foremost of men, with a view to range into theforest Dandaka after patiently propitiating his mother andinstructing fully his younger brother the mysteries ofrighteousness, went round his mother with reverence and made uphis mind to repair unto the forest."

  "Bālakāndam and Ayodhyākāndam": "Hereafter holding the equanimity of mind with patienceself-possessed Rāma spoke thus unto the son of Sumitrā,his dear brother, and friend, who was greatly sorry, had losthis patience and was pressed down with this misfortune ofRāma, and had his eyes inflated with anger like unto aninfuriated elephant;—\"Subduing this anger and sorrow,taking recourse to patience only, brooking the insult andresorting to joy, do thou set aside all those things that havebeen collected here for my installation and make preparationsspeedily for my repairing to the forest. Oh son of Sumitrā,do thou take that amount of trouble for preventing now thecollection of materials for installation, as didst thou takebeforehand for collecting them. Do thou act therefore insuch a way as will remove the apprehension from the mindof our mother (Kaikeyi), who is troubled at heart so greatlyon hearing of my installation. O son of Sumitrā, Icannot neglect for a moment the trouble which hass arisen inher mind on account of this fear. I do not remember to havedone on any occasion wilfully or unwilfully any thingthat is displeasing onto my father or mothers. My father isof truthful words and vows and he has been greatly terrifiedby the fear of the next world; may his fear disappear now.If this work of installation be not stopped, my father shallbe greatly pained at heart thinking that his vows shall notbe fulfilled and his sorrow will also ache me. And it is forthis reason, Oh Lakshmana, that I purpose speedily to retirefrom this city to the forest, renouncing the preparations formy installation. On my wandering away unto the forestto-day, the daughter of Kekaya shall have her ends attainedand shall install Bharata on the throne without anydisturbance whatsoever. Myself going to the forest, wearing bark,tiger-skin and matted hair, Kaikeyi shall attain the happinessof her mind. That great One, who has inspired Kaikeyi withthis mode of mind and has kept it firm, I cannot offend. Ishall repair hence without any delay. Do thou regard, OhLakshmana, Destiny as the only cause of this transfer of thekingdom, although attained, and of my banishment. Had notDestiny been instrumental in bringing about thisdetermination in Kaikeyi, she would not have been so muchpersevering in the infliction of misery upon me. Knowest thou, Ohgentle Lakshmana, that I have never made any distinction inmy mind between my mothers, nor did Kaikeyi make anysuch thing before between me and her son; consequently itis Destiny only that has made her press for the prevention ofmy installation and for my exile with harsh and cruel words,or else why should she, a daughter of a king and possessedof an excellent temper and high accomplishments, speakpainful words unto me in the presence of her husband likeunto an ordinary woman. That which is abovecomprehension is Destiny and it is beyond the power of creatures toavert its consequences; and evidently it is through thisDestiny that have sprung up this distemper of Kaikeyi andmy loss of kingdom. What man dares withstand Oh son ofSumitrā, this (terrible) Destiny hidden from our view untilknown by the consequences of action. Destiny is the primesource of those inconceivable causes which occur withreference to happiness misery, fear, and anger, profit andloss, birth and deliverance. Seers of great austerity beinginfluenced by this Destiny, succumb to the attack of angerand desire, renouncing all their hard disciplines. Thehinderance in this world to the completion of works taken inhand, and the origination of an unthought of event in itsstead, is nothing but the action of this Destiny. The mindbrought under discipline by this true rationale, there remainsno cause of sorrow regarding my installation being put a stopto. Do thou therefore assuage thy grief and follow me andintercept speedily the collection of materials for myinstallation. The bathing ceremony, necessary before taking thevows of asceticism, shall be performed, O Lakshmana, withall these jars full of water brought for my installation. Orwhat necessity have I with all these articles of installation;water drawn from the well by myself shall do for entering intothe vow of exile. Do not grieve, Oh Lakshmana,for the loss of this kingdom. Of kingdom and exile into theforest, exile is fraught with glorious results. Knowest thounow the mighty power of Destiny and do not blametherefore my younger mother and my father laboring underthe influence of Destiny."

  "Bālakāndam and Ayodhyākāndam": "Being addressed by Rāma thus, Lakshmana, the mightyhero, hanging down his head with half reluctance, pondered forsometime, and, placed midway between joy and grief, withfrown drawn in between his brows, began to sob hot and hard,like unto an angry serpent in a cave belonging to another.No body could eye his face, having terrible frowns, whichlooked like that of an angry lion. Moving the extremitiesof his hands like unto the trunk of an elephant, variouslyaltering the altitude of the neck above his frame, glancing alook awry, thus spoke he unto his brother. \"To avoid thetransgression of righteousness, and the degradation of thepeople (consequent upon a bad example), thou art eager torepair unto the forest. This thy eagerness is certainlymisplaced. Wast not thou under error, how could one likethyself, being heroic among the Kshatriyas, and capable ofovercoming Destiny, speak in such a strain as behoves onethat is impotent. Why dost thou extol Destiny which ispowerless and weak. For what reason dost thou notapprehend (unrighteousness) in those two (Daçarātha and Kaikeyi),addicted to vice. Dost thou not understand that there aremany people who feign piety outwardly (to deceive thesimple). With a desire to renounce thee by fraud,they simulatepiety which is but selfishness. Had they not purposedthus, Oh, Rāghava, things would not have taken such a turn.If this story of the vows be true, then why had it not beendeclared before. Surely has the monarch engaged in anaction hateful to the people, namely the installation of ayounger brother neglecting thee (the eldest one). Pray, pardonme, Oh great hero, I cannot brook all this. Even that so calledvirtue do I loathe, which has, O high-souled one, fascinatedthee, and made thy mind run from one extreme to another.120Why shalt thou, being capable of work, conform these impiousand cursed words of thy father, who is sadly under theinfluence of Kaikeyi. Here lies my sorrow that thou dost notadmit that this disturbance of the installation has arisenout of the pretext of boon giving; thy idea of virtue is indeedan object of censure. People will mark this thy forsakingof the kingdom for redeeming the vows of thy father, withopprobrium. Who else, save thee, even thinks of compassingthe desires of the monarch and the queen Kaikeyi, who areof unrestrained habits, ever intent on our mischief and are ourenemies known by the name of parents. Even if their throwingobstacles in the way of thy installation thou considerest, asthe inevitable action of Destiny—pray disregard it, that doesnot please me. He, who is tremulous, weak and powerless,follows the track of Destiny; they pay no regard to it whoare mighty heroes and whose prowess is held in esteem bythe people. He, who can avert the consequences of Destinyby dint of his manliness, does not lose heart even in the faceof his interest being endangered by it. People shall witnessto-day the power of Destiny and manliness; this day shallappear which of them is more powerful. Those who havewitnessed before the prevention of thy installation by the evilagency of Destiny, shall see it defeated, even this very day,by my manliness. Thwart shall I that assailing Destiny bymy prowess like unto a terrible elephant, freed of its shacklespast the restraining power of a goading hook and inflamedwith the juice issuing out of its temples. What of thefather, not even all the protectors of the regions nor theentire population of the three worlds shall be able topresent any obstacle in the way of Rāma's installation. Thosewho have, with one voice, Oh king, settled about thy exileunto the forest, shall be banished to day for fourteen years.Burn shall I down that hope of my father and Kaikeyi thatthey want to place Bharata on the throne by hindering thyinstallation. Influence of destiny shall not bring myopponents that amount of happiness, as the misery inflicted onthem by my terrible prowess. Thyself retiring unto theforest after governing the people for a thousand years, thysons shall resume the administration. Dwelling into theforest is permitted after making over (the charge of thesubjects unto (the hands of the) sons, as did the Rajarshis ofold. The monarch changing his mind, the kingdom shallbe transferred into another's hands—dost thou, being afraidof this, want to fly as an exile unto the forest? And is it forthis, that thou Oh virtuous souled Rāma, dost not wish tohave kingdom for thee? I do promise unto thee, Oh greathero, that I shall protect thy kingdom like unto shoreprotecting the sea, or else I shall not attain to the region ofheroes. Do thou perform the rites of installation withthings necessary for benediction—do thou engage in theseaffairs—myself alone shall be able by force to thwart theopposition of the kings. These hands of mine are notintended for enhancing the beauty of my body—this bow isnot meant for an ornament only, this sword is not forbinding woods together with, and these arrows are not for carryingthe weight of woods—these four belonging to me are forthe use of killing the enemies. Never do I desire that Ishall not cut them into pieces with sharp edged swords,brilliant as the lightning, whom I do consider as my enemies,though they be redoutable as Indra, the wielder ofthunderbolt. Cover thick shall I the field of battle and make itimpassable by cutting assunder the trunks of the elephants,thighs of the horses and heads of the infantry. Beingbeheaded by my swords like unto the flaming fire andbesmeared with blood resembling the clouds with lightning,my enemies shall fall down to the ground. Who is there,proud of his own prowess, that shall be able to withstand mewhen I shall appear at the battle field with bows and leathernfences of fingers. Killing one with a number of arrows, andsometimes many with a single one, I shall drive shafts intothe vital organs of men, horses and elephants. To-day shall Idisplay my skill in arms in destroying the supremacy of themonarch and establishing thine. That hand, which is fit forthe smearing of the Sandal, for wearing armlets, distributingwealth and maintaining relations, shall be engaged to-day,Oh Rāma, in performing its worthy action—the discomfitureof them who want to throw obstacles in the way of thyinstallation. Pray tell me now, which of your enemies shall becut off by me from wealth, life and relatives? I am thyservant: do thou give me instruction that the whole earthmay be brought under thy subjection\". That descendant ofRaghu, wiping tears off the eyes of Lakshmana andconsoling him repeatedly, spoke unto him saying \"Oh gentleone, I have thought it to be the best way by all means thatI shall abide by my father's orders.\""

Why are notthy subjects, citizens, urbans, and leading members of societydressed and adorned, willing to follow thee? Why does notthat excellent sport-chariot go before thee, having four fastgoing steeds, adorned with golden ornaments tied unto it?Why does not that excellent elephant precede thee, Oh greathero, which is gifted with auspicious marks and resemblesa mass of dark clouds and a mighty hill? Why do not theservants run before thee, Oh mighty hero, with a pretty lookingroyal seat embroidered with gold? Why do I perceivethy face so pale as never seen before, and why therein isno mark of gladness, when every thing for thy installationhas been made ready?\" Wereupon spoke untothat weeping Sitā, the descendant of Raghu thus:—\"OhSitā, Oh thou born of a great family, versed in theknowledge of religion and intent on the performance of religiousrites, my father has banished me unto the forest! Do thouhear, Oh daughter of Janaka, how has this calamity befallenme. In the days of yore was granted unto my mother,Kaikeyi two boons by my father, king Daçarātha of truthfulvows. When every thing was made ready by my father formy installation, Kaikeyi reminded him of his promise andgained over him for his righteousness. I shall live in theforest of Dandaka for fourteen years and Bharata shall beinstalled by my father as the heir apparent of the throne.And myself bound to fly as an exile unto the wood,come here to see thee; do thou not praise me ever beforeBharata. Those who are crowned with prosperity cannotbear another's praise; it therefore behoves thee not to extolmy virtues in the presence of Bharata. Thou shouldstnot extol me even in the company of thy friends; thou shaltbe then able to live with Bharata as one favourable to hisparty. The monarch has granted him this lasting heirapparentship; it is therefore proper for thee, Oh Sitā, toplease him specially for he is the king now. To day shallI repair unto the forest for redeeming my father's vows; dothou, Oh high-minded one, live here in undisturbed mind.Do thou, Oh sinless and auspicious one, live here engagedin religious rites and fasts, when I shall wend my way untothe forest inhabited by the great ascetics. Rising from thebed early in the morning, adore the deities every day, andthen bow down unto the feet of my father Daçarātha, thelord of men. My mother Kauçalyā is old and much presseddown with sorrow; do thou show proper respects unto her,considering it to be a pious deed. Thou shouldst then bowdown unto my other mothers who all minister unto me, withequal love and affection. Shouldst thou specially regardBharata and Satrugna like unto thy sons or brothers,who are dearer unto me than my life itself. Thou shouldstnot do, Oh Vaidehi, any such thing as might be unpleasantunto Bharata, for he is the king of the land as well as ofthe family."

It thereforebehoves thee, Oh auspicious one, to live here, abiding byBharata's commands and being engaged in religious ritesand truthful vows. I am going unto the forest, Oh mydarling, and thou shalt live here. Oh excellent lady, abide bymy word as didst thou never formerly falsify it."

I cannot but laugh at thy words, Oh best of men; what thou hastsaid is not becoming of a mighty prince versed in militaryarts and is really very opprobrious and infamous. What more,it is not proper even to hear them. Oh dear husband, father,mother, son, brother, daugther-in-law, all of them abide bythe consequences of their own actions, it is the wife alone,Oh best of men, that shares the fate of her husband; ittherefore that ever along with thee I have been ordered tolive in the forest. Neither father, mother, son, friends, norher ownself is the stay of a woman in this or in after life,it is the husband alone that is her only support. If dost thourepair to-day unto the forest impregnable, I shall go beforethee, Oh Rāghava, treading upon the thorns and pricklygrass. Confident do thou take me with thee, Oh great hero,renouncing jealousy and indignation, like unto water leftafter drinking; there exists no sin in me that could justifyforsaking. Unto woman is preferable under all circumtancesthe shade of her husband's feet to the tops of a palace,the celestial car or excursion in the airy path.131 I have beentaught by my father and mother to follow my husband in allconditions of life; and I shall carry out now what I have beentaught; I shall not abide by any other counsel. I shall wendmy way unto the forest impassable, devoid of men. inhabitedby various deers, tigers and other voracious animals. Happilyshall I live there as if in my paternal house, giving no thoughtupon the prosperity of the three worlds, thinking onlyof the services that are to be rendered unto my husband. Ishall sport with thee, Oh great hero, in that forest impregnatedwith the fragrance of flowers, tending thee constantly,having my senses subdued, and being engaged in austereperformances. Oh great hero, capable art thou to maintainmany thousand others in the forest, what of me. Surelyshall I go to-day to the forest with thee; there is no doubtabout it and thou shalt not be able, Oh great hero, todissuade me from so doing. Undoubtedly I shall always liveupon roots and fruits; living with thee always I shall not bringabout thy affliction. Always I shall precede thee whenwalking, and shall take my repast after thou hast taken it. Willingam I to view mountains, rivulets, lakes and ponds. Beingfearless in thy company, Oh my intelligent husband and greathero, I shall behold on all sides ponds filled with wild geeseand ducks and beautified with a collection of fullblown lotuses,and shall bathe there every day, pursuing the same vow withthee. And greatly gratified, I shall, Oh thou having expansiveeyes, amuse there with thee, in this manner, even for hundredor thousand years. I shall never experience the reverse offortune, inasmuch as I do not like to live in the abode ofcelestials, Oh Rāghava, if I am to dwell there without thee;no, it is not pleasing unto me, Oh best of men. I shall gothere in that dense forest full of deers, monkeys and elephantsand live there as if under my paternal roof cleaving unto thyfeet and abiding in thy pleasure. Do thou accept my entreatywhose heart is entirely thine, knows none else, and is everattached unto thee, and who am resolved to die if forsaken bythee; thus repairing I shall be in no way a burden unto thee\".That best of men, reluctant to take Sitā with him, who hadspoken thus and who was greatly attached to virtue, relatedunto her about the many miseries consequent upon dwelling inthe forest, with a view to prevent her from following him."

Oh Sitā, Oh thou of the weaker sex, dothou act up to my counsels; there are evils enough in theforest, do thou learn them from me who am about to dwellin it. Renounce therefore. Oh Sitā, thy intention of flyingas an exile unto the forest, which for its impenitrablenessis said to abound in evils. It is for thy welfare that I giveutterance to these words; happiness there is none, it isalways covered with miseries. The roarings of the lionsliving in the caves of mountains, swelling with the soundsof the waterfalls, produce a very painful impression uponthe ears; so the wood is full of misery. Animals, all maddened,sporting in solitude, seeing (man), approach to attackhim; so the wood is full of misery. The rivers are full ofcrocodiles, sharks, and other fearful animals, muddy andimpassable and always infested with infuriated elephants;the wood is full of misery. There the wayfares are coveredwith creepers and thorns: they are void of drinking water andever resounded with the noise of the wild fowls; so the woodis full of misery. Being exhausted with the toil of the day,the dwellers of the wood have to sleep in night on the bedmade of leaves fallen from the trees on the surface of theground; so the wood is full of misery. With the (supply of)fruits that have fallen from the trees man of self disciplinemust content himself morning and evening; so the wood,O Sitā, is full of misery. One has to fast, O Maithili,according to his might, to wear matted hair and bark, toadore the deities and his ancestors according to due rites,every day to serve the guests that come to him, andobserving the rules of asceticism, to bathe every day thrice,namely, in the morning, in the mid-day and in the evening;so the wood is full of misery. One has to offer presentsof flowers collected by his ownself unto the altars, O Sitā,according to the rites of the ascetics; so the wood is full ofmisery. Those that dwell in the forest will have to remaincontent, having practised moderation in food, O Maithili,with whatever edibles are attainable in the forest; so thewood is full of misery. There are always violent winds,darkness, hunger, and great fear; so the wood is full ofmisery. Reptiles, many and of various kinds, creep thereon the path, O excellent lady, with haughtiness; so the woodis full of misery. And snakes living in the rivers and ofcrooked course like them, always await the wayfarers,hindering the passers-by: so the wood is full of misery.Birds, scorpions, insects mosquitos and wild gnats, alwaysdisturb the dwellers, O fair one of the weaker sex; so thewood is full of misery. There are trees full of thorns, havingtheir branches moving to and fro, and the kusa and kāsagrasses with thorny blades constantly undulating; so thewood is full of misery. There are various physical afflictionsand divers fears and great misery consequent upon living inthe forest. Anger and desires are to be renounced, the heartis to be set on ascetic austerities, fear in the fearful objects isto be cast off; so the wood is full of misery.

Henceforth ifpeople through ignorance say that the sun has not thatburning flood of light which in Rāma does shine forth,woe is them, it is falsehood. Why art thou so dejectedand whence is thy fear that thou art willing to leave behindthy wife who has none else but thee?

When with thee, the various thorny grasses,the Kusa, the Kāsa, the Sara, and the Ishika, and thethistles and brambles on the way, shall be unto me intouch like unto linen and deer-skin.

Fruits, roots and leaveswhich thou wilt bring thyself and give me, be they great orsmall in quantity, shall be to me like unto the ambrosia-juice.I shall never think of my father, mother, or my abode; I shallenjoy fruits and flowers growing in various seasons. Thou shaltnot witness any thing disagreeable there; for me thou shaltnot experience any sorrow,nor shall I be a burden unto thee;do thou take me with thee, O Rāma, conceiving withpleasure that thy company is a heaven unto me and thyabsence a hell.

And the two looked beautiful with a couple ofhandmaids (following them), taking the weapons that had beendecked by Sitā with flowery wreaths. Then crowds ofelegantly-attired citizens, mounting on the terraces of three-storied and seven-storied houses, looked on the scene withhearts filled with sorrow. And unable to tread the streetsbecause of a vast concourse, they ascending the terraces of thebuildings, eyed Rāghava with woe-begone eyes. Anddeprived of their senses by grief, the multitudes,135 beholdingRāma proceeding on foot in company with Sitā and hisyounger brother, said,—\"He that used to be followed by thevast body of the four-fold forces, proceeds now along withSitā, followed by Lakshmana alone. Knowing every kind ofenjoyment, that magnanimous one who has tasted of everyluxury, for maintaining the dignity of morality, does not wishto falsify (his father's) word. And that Sitā whom formerlythe very rangers of the sky could not see, is to-day beheldby the passers-by. Now summer's heat and winter's coldand the rains of the wet season will speedily stain Sitā,whose person is worthy of being dyed, and who used todaub her limbs with red sandal paste. Surely to-dayDaçarātha speaks thus, possessed by some evil spirit; for theking ought by no means to banish his beloved son. Whoever exiles his son, albeit he be worthless? And what is tobe said concerning a son that has fast secured all men's heartsby his behavior? Universal benevolence, kindness, learninggoodness, the restraint of the senses, and the control of thefaculties,—these six qualities adorn that best of men, Rāghava.Therefore the subjects will be afflicted in consequenceof his separation, even as aquatic animals are, when summerdries up the waters of a tank. The entire earth is distressedon account of the distress of this lord of the earth, even likea tree bearing blossoms and fruits, when its roots have beensevered. Surely this highly effulgent one with virtue for hischief good, is the root of humanity, and the latter representsits flowers, fruits, foliage, and boughs. Therefore,accompanied by our wives and friends will we like Lakshmanafollow the departing Rāghava by the same way that he takes.And leaving aside our gardens and fields and abodes, willwe, making the righteous Rāma's happiness and misery ourown, follow him. Let Kaikeyi possess herself of our desertedmansions, deprived of their buried treasures, with theirunswept courtyards robbed of kine and wealth, and shorn of allsubstance, filled with dust, and abandoned by the deities,mansions where rats will run from hole to hole, which will neitheremit smoke nor contain water, which will not be swept bybroomsticks, from which sacrifices, and the slaughter ofsacrificial beasts,and the offering of oblations and the recitation ofsacred texts, and Yapa, will be absent, and around which willbe strewn broken earthenware, as they are on occasions ofpolitical commotions or the occurrence of natural calamities. Letthe forest to which Rāghava repairs resemble a city, and letthis city renounced by us be converted into a wilderness.Inspired by the fear of us, serpents will leave their holes, andbeasts and birds the caves of mountain, and elephantsand lions the forest. Let them occupy the tracts leftbehind by us, and let them renounce such abounding inserpents, beasts, and birds, as yield grass, meat, and fruits.Let Kaikeyi (reign in this realm) along with her sons andadherents; we, renouncing homes, will dwell in the forestwith Rāghava.\""

Thereupon concludingthat the king agitated by sorrow was bewailing Rāma, thecharioteer said with joined hands. And first paying homageunto the king, invoking victory upon him, the charioteer,perplexed with fear, softly and sweetly addressed the monarchthus:—\"O foremost of men, your son waits at the entrance,after having distributed wealth to Brāhmanas and his retinueLet that one having truth for prowess, good betide you, seeyou.

Theking seeing his son drawing nigh with joined hands, hastilyrose up from his seat in company with his wives. And castinghis eyes on Rāma, the king rushed towards him, but beforereaching his son, the aggrieved monarch fell down to theearth in a swoon. Rāma and that migthy car-warriorLakshmana swiftly neared the king striken with grief and renderedsenseless by sorrow. And there arose in the palace criesof women by thousands of \"Ah Rāma,\" mingled with thetinkling of ornaments. Then both Rāma and Lakshmanaalong with Sitā took the king up with their arms, andwith tears in their eyes laid him upon the couch. Whenthe lord of the earth oppressed with the vapour begot ofgrief and overwhelmed with emotion, had regained his senses,Rāma with joined palms said—\"I ask you, O mightymonarch, as you are the lord of all. Do you see me safelydespatched to the forest of Dandaka. Do you permitLakshmana, and let Sitā also follow mc to the woods; for althoughprohibited by me with various reasons, they do not wish tobe left behind. Do you, O bestower of honor, permit us all,renouncing sorrow—Lakshmana and Sitā and me,—likePrajāpati permitting his sons.\" Seeing Rāghava about toset out for the forest, the lord of earth said unto the calmRāma waiting for his orders,—\"O Rāghava, I have beendeprived of my senses in consequence of my having conferredboons on Kaikeyi. Do you therefore confining me to-daybecome king in Ayodhyā.\" Thus addressed by the monarch,Rāma—the best of the righteous—well versed in speech, withjoined hands addressed his father thus,—\"O king do yourule this earth for a thousand years,—I will reside in theforest. I do not wish for the kingdom. Having spent fiveand nine years in the woods, I shall again embrace your feet,lord of men, after fulfilling your vow.\" Fettered in the netof promise, the king bewailing his beloved son, secretlyspurred on by Kaikeyi, said,—\"Do you, my darling, with theview of attaining welfare here and hereafter and auspiciousfortune, go calmly your fearless way,—so that you may returnhither (in time.) I dare not, O descendant of the Raghurace, forbid you who are established in truth and who arebent upon discharging your duty. But, O son, do not by anymeans depart to-night: beholding you even for a single day,I shall feed with you. Do you, seeing me as well as yourmother, stay here to-night. Then ministered unto everyway, you will set out to-morrow. O son, O beloved Rāghavadifficult is the task that you are going to perform,—forcompassing my good in the next world, you are ready to repairto the very woods! But, O Rāghava, I swear unto you,this is anything but agreeable to me, my son. I have beenmade to swerve from my purpose by the crafty Kaikeyiresembling a fire hidden under ashes. You are going to giveeffect to the deceit that has been practised upon me by thiswoman intent upon sullying her line. And as you are myeldest son, it is no wonder, O son, that you should wish tomaintain your father's truth.\" Hearing these words of hisdistressed father, the humble Rāma, along with his brotherLakshmana, said,—\"Who will confer on me the merittomorrow that I shall reap by going to-day? Therefore, Iprefer even the journey to the woods to enjoying comforts here.Do you bestow upon Bharata this earth renounced by me—this kingdom abounding in corn and kine and filled withpeople; my mind determined upon dwelling in the forest, doesnot waver. Do you, O bestower of boons, grant Kaikeyieverything that you had promised unto her at the time ofthe war136 (you had waged against the Dānavas), and therebydo you follow truth. Obeying the mandate that you haveissued, I will dwell in the forest for fourteen years in thecompany of the rangers of the woods. Do you withoutfeeling any compunction confer the earth on Bharata. Mineis not the desire to obtain the kingdom for enjoyinghappiness or attaining any benefit. I will, O descendantof the Raghu race, do your bidding. Banish your grief, andsuppress your tears. That lord of streams, the irresistibleocean, never forsakes his own magnanimity. I desireneither dominion, nor happiness, nor the earth,137 nor anyobject138 of enjoyment, nor heaven, nor life. O foremost ofmen, all I wish for is that you may not come by falsehood, andabide by truth. I truly and in good sooth swear before youthat I cannot, O lord, remain here for a moment longer,O my father. Do you bear this grief. I cannot for certainact contrary to my promise. Directed by Kaikeyi saying,—'Do you, O Rāghava, go to the forest,' I had said,—'I willgo,'—That promise I must accomplish. Do you not, O reveredone, feel aggrieved. We will abide in the forest aboundingin mild deer and resounding with the notes of variousbirds. The father is a very God,—even the celestials saythis. Therefore will I look upon your word in the light ofdivinity. And, O best of monarchs, after the fourteenyears have been spent, you will see me again by your side,—therefore do you banish this grief. Why do you, O foremostof men, who will suppress other's grief, undergo thisalteration? Do you confer upon Bharata this city and thiskingdom and the earth renounced by me. Doing yourbehest, I will repair to the forest, sojourning there for a longtime. Staying at the auspicious frontiers, let Bharata barelyrule this earth furnished with watery expanses, cities andforests, when it has been renounced by me. O king, letwhat you have said be as you wish it. I do not, O king, setmy heart upon any great object of desire, nor do I seek myown behoof, as I am bent upon, O you beloved of the good,working out your will. O sinless one, you will not thereforereap any evil on my account. Associating you withuntruth, I would not, O sinless one, wish even for yourcompany who are agitated with anxiety,139 or this entirekingdom, or every object of desire, or the earth, orMithilā's daughter. Even this is my truthful vow,—let alsoyour vow prove true. Living upon fruits and roots in theforest, and surveying mountains and tanks and streamsand graceful trees, I shall be happy on entering theforest, Do you cease to lament.\" Thus benetted withcalamities and exercised with grief and anguish, the kingembraced his son,—and then deprived of his consciousnessfell down on the ground and became motionless.

I consider you the murderess of your husbandand as one that has finally exterminated one's line; inasmuchas you have by your act afflicted the monarch invincible likeIndra, firm as a hill, and imperturbable like the deepitself. You ought not to bring down your boon-bestowinglord and husband Daçarātha; for surely the wish of ahusband to a wife outweighs a koti of sons. The princes willobtain the kingdom one after another according to age;—this custom it is your study to render nugatory even whenthe lord of the Ikshāwaku race is still alive.

And why dothnot the flaming and dreadful censure uttered by the mightyBrahmārshis destroy you who are bent upon banishing Rāma?Who having hewn a mangoe tree by his axe, tendeth a Nimba?It never turns sweet for him that waters it.

Thereatyour mother getting angry, wishing for the noose of death,said,—'O king, O placid one, I ask you for the reason ofyour laughter.' The king replied,—'O worshipful lady, ifI unfold unto you the reason of my laugh, then I shallwithout doubt die to-day.' But that revered one, your mother,again urged Kekaya, saying,—'Tell it to me, whether youlive or die; for (when I have learnt all about it), you will notbe able to laugh at me again.' Thus addressed by his belovedspouse, that lord of earth Kekaya went to the saint thathad conferred the boon on him and related unto himeverything faithfully. Thereupon that boon-giving saint said untothe kin; \"Whether this one kills herself or be destroyed, doyou not, O king reveal it.\" Hearing these words of his, theking well pleased summarily forsook your mother and beganto divert himself like Kuvera. Even in the same way, you,O you that see only evil, staying in an unrighteous countbefouling the king's sense, endeavour to make him committhis wrong. In this connection I remember a saying, viz.,—men take after their fathers, and women their mothers. Donot be so,—do you even accept what the lord of earth says.Doing the will of your lord, do you become the refuge of usall. Do not incited by evil propensities, make your husbandthe lord of men endued with the prowess of the celestialchief, perpetrate an unrighteous deed. That sinless onewill not for certain give practical effect to the promisejestingly made by you. O worshipful one, king Daçarātha isgraceful, being furnished with eyes resembling lotuses.

And let sweet-speeched courtezans and opulent traders grace the extensivearmy of the prince. And, giving them immense wealth, doyou also send with him those that depend on Rāma, as wellas those with whom he delights to wrestle.

Thereupon that worker of iniquitywent to the forest and went about seeing mountainfastnesses. Thus did the virtuous king Sagara renouncehis son. But what offence has Rāma committed that heis to be banished? We do not find any fault whatever inRāghava. Rare is his fault even like the spot on the Moon.Or it may be, O exalted lady, that you perceive some faultin Rāghava,—Do you, if so, unfold it; and then let Rāmabe banished.

And the warders of the inner apartment, and thepeople of the kingdom and the city taking with them theirneccessaries and servants will accompany Rāghava and hiswife. And Bharata and Satrughna wearing ascetic clothes andranging the forest will live like their elder brother resident inthe woods. Then alone thou of vile ways and intent uponharming the people wilt govern this empty earth desertedby the inhabitants, along with the trees. That can never bea kingdom where Rāma is not the monarch, and that forestwhere Rāma will reside will flourish into a monarchy.Bharata never wishes to govern a kingdom that has not beenconferred upon him by his father; nor, if he has really beenbegotten by the monarch, wilt he any further act by you as ason. Even if you leaving the earth fly unto the air, that onecognizant of the character of his ancestry, will never actotherwise. Therefore although intent on advancing yourson, you have really brought about his injury. There existsnot a person in the world that is not partial to Rāma.

And let the daughter of theKing go to the forest, surrounded by excellent cars andservants, and taking with her attires and other necessarythings.

Thensoon regaining consciousness, the lord of earth with tearfuleyes, addressed Sumuntra, saying,—\"Yoking a riding carwith excellent horses, do you come hither; and take theexalted one to the south of the kingdom. The virtuous andheroic Rāma is being banished by his father and mother.Even this methinks will be asserted as the fruit of thevirtues possessed by the pious.\" Receiving the mandate ofthe sovereign, Sumantra endued with fleet vigour, yokinga car adorned with horses, came there. Then the charioteerwith joined hands announced to the prince that the caradorned with gold was ready, yoked with excellent horses.The king, versed in time and place, and pure, speedilysummoning his treasurer, said unto him these words firmly,—\"Do you without delay bring unto Vaidehi excellent andcostly attires and noble ornaments, counting these (ten andfour) years.\" Thus desired by the foremost of men, thatofficer repairing to the treasury, procuring all those,speedily presented them to Sitā. Thereupon that pure-sprungone, Vaidehi, ordered to the forest, adorned her goodlylimbs with those rare ornaments. And thus decked out,Vaidehi graced that chamber like the effulgence of theSun irradiating the welkin with his rays. Thenembracing with her arms Mithilā's daughter of noble behaviour,and smelling the crown of her head, Sitā'smother-in-law said,—\"Those women that although having alwaysbeen carefully tended by their husbands, do not regardthem during the incident of adversity, are in this worldreckoned as unchaste.—Even this is the nature of women:having formerly tasted happiness (at the hands of theirhusbands), they, on the accession of an inconsiderablemisfortune, take them to task,—nay, forsake them utterly.Those women that are untruthful, unmindful, of evil ways,heartless, intent on unrighteous acts, and whose love isevanescent, are unchaste. Neither lineage, nor benefit, norlearning, nor gift, nor forbearance of faults, can secure thehearts of females,—surely their hearts are unstable. Butchaste women of good character, abiding in truth, acting inaccordance with the precepts of superiors, and maintainingthe dignity of their race, single out their lords as the primemeans of compassing their spiritual welfare. Thereforealthough my son is going to be banished to the woods, youshould by no means disregard him. Whether he be wealthy orpoor, he is unto you like a god.\" Hearing her mother-in-law's words fraught with virtue and interest, Sitā facing thatlady, said with joined palms,—\"I will do all that the nobleone says. I know how I should act by my husband. I haveheard all about that (from my parents.) The worshipful oneought not to place me on the same footing with unrighteouspersons. As brightness doth not depart from the moon, soI cannot swerve from virtue. The Vinā without stringsdoes not sound; and the car without wheels does not move,—so although having an hundred sons, a woman without herhusband cannot attain happiness. The Father gives inmeasure, the father and the son give in measure,—but who doesnot worship that bestower of 'riches fineless'—the husband?O exalted one, having learnt from my superiors the principalas well the minor duties, shall I disregard (my lord)? Ahusband is a deity unto the wife.\" Hearing Sitā's words whichwent directly to the heart, Kauçalyā endued with purity ofspirit, out of fulness of bliss and bale suddenly shed tears. Thenwith joined hands that foremost of virtuous ones addressed hismother, who, duly honored by all, was seated in the midst ofhis other mothers, saying,—\"O mother, without indulging ingrief, you should minister unto my father; and the term ofmy abode in the woods will shortly expire. You will findthese five and nine years pass away as if in a sleep. Thenagain, getting me,you will see me surrounded by my friendsand relatives.\" Having spoken out his mind unto his mother,Rāma attentively eyed his three hundred and fifty mothers.And with joined hands Daçarātha's son spake words fraughtwith virtue unto his mothers afflicted like Kauçalyā herseH\"If I have said anything harsh to you in consequence afamiliarity, or done any wrong through ignorance, do youforgive the same. I salute you all.\" These calm words ofRāghava informed with piety were heard by the ladiesoverwhelmed with grief. As Rāghava was speaking thus, thenarose a loud wail proceeding from those wives of that chiefof men, like unto the cries of Kraunchis. And the aboAof Daçarātha which formerly resounded with murajas,panavas, meghas,141 was now filled with cries of distress andlamentations."

Following his brother, Lakshmana salutedKauçalyā; then he again took hold of his mother Sumitrā'sfeet. As the son of Sumitrā, was thus engaged inhonoring his mother, his mother smelling the crownof his head, thus spoke unto the mighty-armedLakshmana,—\"Although attached unto thy friends here, thouhast my permission to go to the forest. When Rāmashall have gone (to the woods), do not, O son, showany negligence unto him. O sinless one, whether inprosperity or in adversity, even this one is thy way. Thata younger brother should follow his elder is in this world theduty of the righteous. These are the legitimate duties everobserved by this race—charity, initiation into sacrifice, andrenunciation of the body in the field of battle. Do thouconsider Rāma as Daçarātha, and Janaka's own-begotten asmyself; do thou regard Ayodhyā as a wilderness,—go my son,at thy sweet pleasure.\" Having thus spoken unto that deardescendant of Raghu, who had made up his mind (to journeyto the forest), Sumitrā, again and again said unto him,—\"Go! Go!\" Then like unto Mātali addressing Vāsava, thatone understanding humility, Sumantra, with joined handshumbly said unto Kākutstha,—\"O illustrious prince, goodbetide you: do you ascend the car. O Rāma, I will speedilytake you to wherever you will tell me. You will have tospend fourteen years in the forest, and your stay mustcommence from this very day. So the noble lady hasordered.\" Then having adorned her person, that best of hersex, Sitā, with a glad heart ascended the car resembling thesun. Counting the term of their stay in the woods, herfather-in-law furnished Sitā following her lord with attires andornaments. And then he placed in front of the car variousweapons, coats of mail, a basket bound in hide and a hoe.At length the brothers Rāma and Lakshmana swiftlyascended the flaming car garnished with gold. And seeing themwith Sitā for the third, mounted, Sumantra drove the caryoked with goodly horses resembling the wind in celerity.On Rāghava having left for the forest to stay there for along period, the men and beasts within the city were deprivedof their senses (by grief). And in the city there arose amighty tumult in consequence of the hurrying of people, theelephants waxing mad and furious, and the neighings ofhorses. And the entire city containing young and old,extremely afflicted, rushed after Rāma, like persons oppressedwith the heat of the sun rushing towards water."

We will see thecountenance of Rāma, which we shall never see again. Surely theheart of Rāma's mother is made of iron, for it does notburst on witnessing her son resembling Skanda repairingto the forest. Vaidehi, attaining her desire, follows herhusband, like a shadow—attached to virtue, she does notforsake him even as the Sun forsakes not meru. OLakshmana, you are blessed, since you will serve yourgod-like brother ever speaking fair. This design of yoursis great; this is your mighty good fortune; thisthe way to heaven that you are following him.\" Sayingthis, they could not supress their fears; and the menfollowed the beloved descendant of Ikshwāku. Then theking, his senses overcome by grief, surrounded by hisdistressed wives, went out of his house, saying—\"I will beholdmy dear son.\" He heard before him a mighty noise proceedingfrom weeping women, like unto the roars of she-elephants,when a great elephant has been taken captive. ThereuponRāma's father, the graceful Kākutstha, became shorn of hissplendour, like unto the full-moon enveloped at the appointedtime during the eclipse. Then the auspicious son of Daçarāthaof soul incapable of being comprehended, orderedthe charioteer, saying,—\"Do thou proceed more speedilyRāma saying unto the charioteer,—\"Go,\" and the people,—\"Stay,\" thus desired on the way, the charioteer could notact both ways at once. As the mighty-armed Rāma proceeded,the dust of the earth raised by the car-wheels were laidby the tears of the citizens showering down. And inconsequence of Rāghava's departure, the entire city filled withdespair, and uttering with their senses lost exclamations of\"Oh\" and \"Alas,\" became exceedingly afflicted. And thetears begot of heart's grief that flowed from the eyes of thefemales, resembled rain-drops scattered around from lotusesshaken by the movements of fish. And beholding thecitizens absorbed in one thought, the auspicious monarch felldown in grief like a tree whose roots have been severed.Then seeing the sovereign senseless and stricken withexceeding sorrow, the multitudes at the rear of Rāma brokeout into a loud tumult. And seeing the king weeping aloudwith the inmates of the inner apartment, some exclaiming\"Oh Rāma,\" and others, \"O Rāma's mother,\" began to bewail.Then turning back, Rāma saw that his sorrow-strickenand bewildered father along with his mother, was followinghis track. As a colt fastened in a snare cannot see its mother,so Rāma fastened in the bonds of virtue could not look at hismother openly. And seeing his parents deserving of comfortand worthy of going in a carriage, going on foot, Rāma saidunto the charioteer,—\"Go thou swiftly.\" And that foremostof men was incapable of bearing the looks of his father andmother, like unto an elephant afflicted with the hook, (notbeing able to look at what is placed on its back.)"

Theking exclaimed,—\"Stay,\" Rāghava said,—\"On, On.\"Sumantra's mind vascillated like that of one placed betweentwo hosts burning to encounter each other. Rāma said untohim—\"When taxed by the monarch (on your return), youwill say, 'I did not hear you.' But delay will impart meterrible pain.\" Thereupon, doing Rāma's bidding, thecharioteer, telling the people to desist, made the horses alreadycoursing, run faster. The retainers of the king stoppedafter circumambulating Rāma, but their minds did notturn back. But the others did not return either bodilyor mentally. Then the courtiers said unto that mightymonarch, Daçarātha,—\"He that is expected back shouldnot be followed far.\" Hearing their words, the kingendued with every virtue, with his body covered withperspiration and his countenance woe-begone, and exceedingdistressed, stopped short and stood along with his wifelooking at his son."

He that although falsely accused,used not to be moved by anger, who pacified every enragedperson by renouncing things calculated to fan anger and whofelt equally for all, where goeth he?

Hearing the loud tumult oflamentation in the inner apartment, the lord of earth burning in grieffor his son was striken with sorrow. And oblations unto thefire had not been offered; and the Sun set; and elephantsforsook their forage; and the kine did not suckle theircalves. Trisanku, Lohitānga, Vrihashpati, Budha and theother Grahas getting at the Moon, remained with fierceaspects. The stars are shorn of their brightness; the Grahasdeprived of sheen; and Viçakhā appeareth envelopedin haze. And clouds driven by the wind resembled thesea mounting the welkin; and the city shook on Rāmahaving departed for the forest. And the cardinal points aredistressed, and appear enveloped in darkness. And noplanet or star is to be seen. And all of a sudden the citizenshave been striken with poverty: and no one turns histhoughts to eating or drinking. And ceaselessly burning ingrief and heaving sighs, the people in Ayodhyā rage at themonarch. And with their faces washed in tears, thewayfarers betoken no delight, but all are being exercisedwith grief. And the cool air does not blow, and no moon ofmild appearance is seen, and no sun heats the world, allthe entire Earth is overwhelmed with woe. And sons dependnot upon their parents, hurbands on their wives, and brotherson brothers; and all forsaking each other, think of Rāmaonly. And deprived of sense, and oppressed by the load ofsorrow, the friends of Rāma forsook their rest.

And whenthe ruler of earth could no longer perceive even the dustraised by Rāma's car, then pierced with sorrow, and inheaviness of heart, he fell down to the ground. Then(raising him up), Kauçalyā held his right arm and walkedwith him, while the slender-waisted Kaikeyi walked by hisleft. Endowed with a sense of justice and with virtueand humility, the king with afflicted senses steadily eyeingKaikeyi, thus spake unto her,—\"O Kaikeyi, that hastdecided for following sin, do thou not touch my person,—nordo I wish to see thee. Thou art no wife of mine—not evena maid-servant of a friend sharing his good graces. I amnone to those that subsist on thy favour, nor are theyanything to me.

The righteous one remembering Rāghava repentedhimself, as if he had slain a Brāhmana through inordinatedesire, or as if he had placed his hand in fire. And havingstopped again and again, the visage of the monarch lamentingon beholding the track of the car, appeared dim likethe Moon invaded by Rāhu. And stricken with grief,he lamented, remembering his beloved son; andthinking that by this time he had reached the precinctsof the city, he broke out into the following,—\"On theway are traced the foot-prints of those foremost ofbearers that are carrying my son away; but thatmagnanimous one I do not find. And that meritorious sonof mine, who, doubed with sandal, used to rest his headpleasantly upon a pillow, fanned by beauteous damselsdecked in ornaments, will to-day surely take refugeunderneath a tree, and lay his head on a wooden plankor a stone. Covered with dust, he heaving sighs will risefrom the ground in sad guise, like a leader of she-elephantsrising from the side of a mountain. The rangers of thewoods will now see the long-armed Rāma resembling thelord himself of the worlds, rising from the ground and goinglike one forlorn. And that one so dearly loved by Janaka,worthy of being constantly ministered unto with comforts,is to-day going to the forest, fatigued in consequence ofhaving been pierced with thorns. Unacquainted with theforest, she is certainly afflicted with fright on hearing thedeep roars of ferocious beasts, capable of making one's hairstand erect. O Kaikeyi, do thou realize thy desire,—do thoubecoming a widow, rule this kingdom. Without that best ofmen I cannot live.\" Thus lamenting, the king surroundedby the multitude, like one that had performed his bath afterdeath, entered that best of cities filled with people enfeebledand smitten with grief, with its streets thined of men and itsstalls closed. And beholding that entire city, with his mindfixed upon Rāma, the king lamenting, like unto the sunentering clouds, entered that city like unto an unagitated sea ridof serpents by Suparna,142 the city without Rāma or Lakshmanaor Sitā. Then with tears in his eyes, the lord of earth,lamenting, in unintelligible accents said these sad and brokenwords,—\"Do you speedily take me to the room of Rāma'smother, Kauçalyā; for in no other place shall I find restfor my heart.\" When the king had spoken thus, the usherstaking him to Kauçalyā's chamber, made him lie down inlowly plight. And having entered Kauçalyā's apartment,the king having laid himself on the bed, was overwhelmedwith emotion. And the king surveyed the mansion deprivedof his two sons as well as his daughter-in-law, like untothe welkin deprived of the Moon.

Whythen do you bewail thus, or weep bitterly? Since, O reveredone, renouncing the kingdom, your mighty son wendeth (tothe woods) with the view of fulfiling the intention of his high-souled and truthful sire, the worthy Rāma staying in the dutythat is completely observed by the good and the performanceof which always bringeth welfare in the next world,should by no means be lamented. And that sinless one,Lakshmana, kind unto all creatures, will minister unto Rāmain the best way possible,—and this is to the advantage ofthat high-souled one, And experiencing the hardships thatcome of living in the forest, Vaidehi deserving of happinessfollows your righteous son.

Thathero of mighty energy on whom Brahmā had conferred celestialweapons, seeing that foremost of the Dānavas, the son ofTimidhwaja, slain in battle,—that tiger-like one, relying onthe native strength of his arms, will fearlessly abide in theforest as if in his own home. And why should not the earthremain in the sway of him coming within the range of whosearms enemies find destruction? Considering Rāma's grace,heroism and auspiciousness, (there cannot be any doubt that)returning from the forest, he will speedily regain his ownkingdom. He is the sun of the sun, the lord of the lord,—heis the auspiciousness of prime auspiciousness, the fame offame, the forbearance of forbearance, the god of the gods,—and the foremost of creatures. What evil qualities, O noblelady, will be perceived in him, whether he remains in the cityor in the forest?

Although besought by the subjects, the truthfulKākutstha having pledged his word unto his father, kept ongoing to the forest. And affectionately eying them as ifdrinking them with his sight, Rāma touchingly addressedthose subjects as if they were his own,—\"The love andregard which the inhabitants of Ayodhyā have for me, letthem, for pleasing me, extend in full measure towardsBharata. That enhancer of Kaikeyi's delight bearing anauspicious character, will duly compass your happiness andwelfare. Aged by virtue of his wisdom, although young inyears, and mild albeit furnished with heroic virtue, thatremover of fear will make a fit ruler for ye.

Endowed withkindness, that friend of the good, Rāma, could not byproceeding on his car bear to part with the Brāhmanas that werefollowing on foot. Seeing him thus going, the Brāhmanaswith agitated hearts, and burning in grief, addressed Rāmain these words,—\"The Brāhmanas in a body are followingthee ever seeking their good, and mounting on the shouldersof the regenerate ones, the (sacrificial) Fires are walking inthy wake. And behold these raised umbrellas of ours gotfrom the Vājapeya sacrifice, that like unto autumnal cloudsfollow at your back. With these umbrellas got at the Vājapeyasacrifice, we will afford shade unto Rāma destitute of his ownwhite umbrella, when he shall feel the heat of the (solar) rays.That intelligence of ours which ever followeth the VedicMantras, is now, O child, ready to follow thee unto the forestin thy interests. That best of treasures, the Vedas, residesin our bosoms; and our wives protected by their chastityabide in our homes. As we have already made up our mindsto follow thee, it is useless to fix our hearts afresh. But ifthou overlookest virtue, what becomes of abiding byrighteousness?145 O thou that art ever firm in virtue, we beseech thee byhumbling unto the dust our heads covered with hair whitelike cranes, do thou desist. These numerous Brāhmanas thathave come hither have entered upon many a sacrifice. Thecompletion of these, O child, depends upon thy return. Allcreatures mobile and immobile cherish thee with high regard.All these beseech thee. Do thou show consideration untothose that regard thee. Tall trees deprived of motion inconsequence of being fast rooted to the earth and incapable offollowing thee, are prohibiting thee by sounding with thewind. And birds staying upon trees and neither manifestingany motion nor seeking for their food, beseech thee to havecompassion upon all creatures.\" While the Brāhmanas wereloudly demanding the return of Rāma, he found the darknessto descend as if forbidding him. Then Sumantra unyoked thefatigued horses from the car, which at once fell to rolling inthe dust. And then bathing them and making then drink,he soon as the dusk set in, set fare before them."

Doubtless to-day the men and women ofAyodhyā, the metropolis of my father, are bewailing us retiredto the forest. O foremost of men, the people are attachedunto thyself, the monarch, Bliarata, Satrughna, and myself,because of our various good qualities. I bewail our fatheras well as my illustrious mother. I fear lest lamentingceaselessly, they become blind. But surely the virtuous Bharatawill console our father and mother with words fraughtwith virtue, interest and profit. Reflecting again andagain on Bharata's sincerity of soul, I do not, O mighty-armed one, bewail either my mother or my father. Oforemost of men, that thou hast followed me is whatis thy duty. (If thou hadest not done so), I should haveto seek elsewhere for the protection of Vaidehi. O Sumitrā'sson, I will spend here this night, subsisting on wateralone. Even this recommends itself unto me, although theforest yields various kinds of fruits.\" Having said this untoSumitrā's son, Rāghava spake unto Sumantra, saying,—\"Omild one, do thou now needfully tend the horses.\" Thenat sunset, fastening the horses, Sumantra fed them plentifullywith grass, and then came back. Then seeing the nightarrived, the charioteer worshipped the beneficent Sandhyā,and then in company with Sumitrā's son, preparedRāma's bed. And looking at that bed on the shores of theTamasā surrounded by trees, Rāma along with his wife andthe son of Sumitrā, lay down. When Lakshmana found thatRāma afflicted with fatigue had slept together with his spouse,he began to speak unto the charioteer concerning the variousqualities of Rāma. As remaining awake in the night, Sumitrā'sson was engaged in expatiating to the charioteer on thevirtues of Rāma on the banks of the Tamasā, the sun arose."

These citizens have determinedupon making me turn back from the forest,— they wouldrather renounce their lives than give up their resolve. Letus while they are asleep ascending on our car, swiftly go ourway without fear of molestation. Attached to me, the denizonsof Ikshwāku's city will not again indulge in sleep underneathtrees. A prince should deliver citizens from the calamitythey bring upon themselves; but he should by no meansdrag them into those which he himself has brought on.\"Then Lakshmana spake unto Rāma like unto manifest Virtueon earth,—\"O wise one, even this is relished also by me.Do you speedily ascend (the car.)\" Rāma said unto thecharioteer,—\"Do thou at once yoke the car. I will repair tothe forest. Do thou, my master, swiftly go hence.\" Thereuponthe charioteer bestirring himself, yoking the excellenthorses unto the car, said unto Rāma with joined hands,—\"Here, O mighty-armed one, is your car ready yoked, O foremostof car-warriors. Do you speedily ascend, good betideyou, along with Sitā and Lakshmana.\" Ascending thecar after equipping himself, Rāghava crossed the rapidly-rushing Tamasā abounding in eddies. Having crossed (thestream), the auspicious and mighty-armed one came upon asafe and goodly high way capable of inspiring even timidpeople with confidence. But with the view of deluding thecitizens, Rāma said unto the charioteer.—\"0 charioteer, dothou ascending the car proceed northwards; and havingproceeded swiftly for a while, do thou turn the car. Do thoucarefully act so that the citizens may not perceivethis.\" Hearing Rāma's words, the charioteer did accordingly.and having returned said unto Rāma to ascend thecar."

How could Rāma of mighty arms, resortingto this undesirable course, has gone into exile asan ascetic, leaving behind those that regard him dearly?Why has that foremost of Raghus, who has alwayscherished us even as a father cherishes his sons begot byhis own loins, forsaking us, betaken himself to the forest?Here will we either renounce our lives, or direct our courseto the north to meet death. Of what good are our lives,when we have been deprived of Rāma? There are hugetrunks of dry wood to be got here in plenty. Lighting thepile of woods will we all enter the fire. What shall we say(when people ask us?) How can we say,—'We took hencethe mighty-armed, sweet-speeched and unavenging Rāma'?Surely seeing us without Rāghava, the forlorn city with herwomen, children and grown up folks will be plunged in gridWe had issued with that high-souled hero. Deprived of him,how shall we behold that city?\" Thus raising up their arms,they stricken with grief, indulged in lamentations, like untokine deprived of their calves.—Then following for a while thetrack of the car, they, missing the track, become overwhelmedwith woe. And then those intelligent ones came back by thetrack of the car. \"What is this? What shall we do? Wehave been foiled by some supernatural agency.\" Then theyreturned to the city of Ayodhyā with its good people oppressedwith grief, by the self-same way by which they had come.Viewing the city, they with their eyes weighed down withgrief, and minds oppressed with woe, shed plentiful tears.\"This city deprived of Rāma does not look beautiful, like alake bereft of its serpent by Garura, or the firmament deprivedof the Moon, or the ocean without its waters.\" And theydisturbed in mind beheld the city sunk in sorrow. Andentering their wealthy mansions, they deprived of their senses bygrief, could not recognize them for their own, nor could theywith their hearts rendered absolutely cheerless, althoughlooking at them minutely, distinguish their own from others."

There is one only good man in this worldeven Lakshmana, who along with Sitā is following KākutsthaRāma unto the woods.

He is the lord of all these—he is therefuge—he is the accomplishment of our religious duties.

If this kingdomdevolves on Kaikeyi it will be divested of all virtues and willbe like unto one without a master. And of what avail then isour life itself, not to speak of sons and wealth. Whom else willthat stainer of her line, Kaikeyi, forsake now, who for the sakeof wealth has forsaken her son and her lord? We swear byour sons that so long as Kaikeyi is alive, we living will neverstay in her kingdom, although we may be maintained by her.What happiness can be ours by living with that wicked andunrighteous one who lost to every sense of shame is bentupon exiling the son of the foremost of kings? Troubled bydisturbances, with all its sacrifices stopped, and having nomaster over it, the entire (kingdom) will meet with destructionbecause of Kaikeyi. On Rāma retiring to the forest, thelord of earth will surely not live; and Daçarātha dying, it isevident everything will come to naught. Do you, your virtueexhausted, and oppressed with grief pounding poison, take itor follow Rāghava, or remove to such a place that the veryname of Kaikeyi may not reach your ears? Rāma has beendeceitfully exiled along with his wife and Lakshmana; and weare bound unto Bharata like unto a (sacrificial,) beast beforeone that is to slaughter it.

Returning from my abode in the woods, I will, freedfrom my debt unto the lord of earth, behold thee again alongwith my father and mother.\" Then he furnished withgraceful coppery eyes raising his right hand, with tears in hiseyes and in forlorn guise addressed the people of theprovinces, saying,—\"Ye have shown due compassion andregret for me. To grieve long is not fit. Do ye thereforerepair to look after your interests.\" Thereupon, salutingthat high-souled one and going round him, bewailing all thewhile in heaviness of heart, they at times stopped on theirway. And as they kept lamenting, unsatiated in beholdinghim, Rāghava went beyond the range of their sight, like theSun disappearing at night-fall.

The mighty-armed Rāma came to the Gangānear Sringaverapura. And beholding (the river) with hersurging eddies, that mighty car-warrior said unto the charioteer,Sumantra, \"We will rest here to day. There is hardby the river a gigantic Ingudi tree, bearing a profusion offlowers and fresh leaves. Here, O charioteer, will we stayto-day. I see (before me) the foremost of streams, whosewaters are honored (by all) and which is sacred to celestialsand men and Gandharbas and beasts and serpents and fowls.Thereupon saying unto Rāghava, \"Very well,\" Lakshmanaand Sumantra with the horses went to the Ingudi tree. Andreaching the tree, that desendant of Ikshwāku alighted fromthe car along with his wife and Lakshmana. Thendescending, Sumantra relieved those excellent horses, and withjoined hands stood before Rāma seated at the foot of the tree.There lived at the place a king named Guha, a friend untoRāma, dear as his own self, a Nishāda by birth, powerfuland famed as the lord of the Nishādas. Hearing that thatforemost of men, Rāma, had arrived at the place, he (Guha)surrounded by his aged counsellors and kindred came untohim. Seeing the lord of the Nishadhas at a distance, Rāmacame up unto him in company with Sumitrā's son. Thereattouched, Guha embracing Rāghava said unto him, \"O Rāma,as Ayodhyā this kingdom is unto thee. What shall I do forthee? Who, O might-armed one, receives such a welcomeguest?\" Then speedily bringing various kinds of sapid riceand Arghyas, he said,—\"O mighty -armed one, has thy journeybeen a pleasant one? This entire earth is thine. Weare thy servants; thou art our master. Do thou rule here,accepting the eatables and drinkables and those that are tobe sucked and excellent beds and fodder.\" When Guha hadsaid this, Rāghava answered him, saying,—\"We have beenwell received by thee and are well pleased with thee, sincecoming here on foot thou hast shown us affection.\" Thenpressing Guha hard with his arms, Rāma said, \"O Guha, itis by good luck that I see thee whole along with thy friends.Is thy kingdom in peace both as regards thy friends and theforest? The things that thou hast presented me with out oflove I accept but cannot enjoy. Do thou know me as assumingan ascetic mode of life in the woods, in which I am towear Kuça and bark and live upon fruits and roots. So, willthe single exception of the food for the horses, things requireI none; and these horses being well kept, I shall considermyself as entertained by thee. These are the favorites of myfather, Daçarātha, and on these horses being well providedfor, I shall be well received. Thereupon Guha on the spotcommanded the men, saying, \"Let the horses have withoutdelay meats and drinks.\" Then putting his sheet over hisperson, he (Rāma) performed his evening devotions. Havingdone this, he took as his sustenance the water that had beenprocured by Lakshmana himself. On Rāma having lain downon the ground along with his wife, Lakshmana washed theirfeet, and then remained stationed under the tree. Then bowin hand and with his wits about him, conversing withSumitrā's son along with the charioteer, Guha remained awake,watching Rāma. Thus the livelong night passed away withthat illustrious, intelligent and high-souled son of Daçarātha,unacquainted with troubles and worthy of happiness."

Yet how can I speak this truth which is sovery unpleasant? And ever abiding by my command andused to carry your friends, how can these excellent horsesbear this car without you? Therefore, O sinless one, Ishall not be able to go to Ayodhyā without you; and itbehoves you to permit me to follow you to the forest. Butif you forsake me who beseech you, I will as soon as leftby you, enter into fire along with the car. I shall, ORāghava, by means of this car, withstand all those impedimentsthat shall present themselves against your asceticausterities in the forest. I have through your favourexperienced the pleasure of driving the car. I expectat your hands the pleasure of living in the woods. Be youpropitious. It is my wish to remain in the forest with you,and do you say, affectionately—'Do you remain by my side'.And these horses, O hero, will attain to a supreme state ifthey serve you during your abode in the forest. Living in theforest, I will serve you with the crown of my head; and Iwill entirely renounce Ayodhyā or the celestial regionsthemselves. Even as a doer of evil deeds cannot enterthe metropolis of the mighty Indra, I am incapable of enteringAyodhyā without you. And this is my desire that theterm of exile over, I may carry you back to the palace onthis very car. Remaining with you in the forest the fourteenyears will pass away dwindled into a moment, but withoutyou, they shall assume the proportions of an hundred years.O you bearing affection towards your servants, it does notbehove you to forsake your servant having regard for you,ever abiding by the way that is wended by the son of hismaster, and observing the duties of his pesition.\"Thereupon Rāma kind towards servants, said these words untoSumantra as he besought him thus humbly in various ways,\"O thou that bearest attachment unto thy master, I knowthat thou regardest me highly. But do thou listen as to whyI send thee to the city from hence. Seeing thee returned tothe city, my youngest mother Kaikeyi will believe that Rāmahas gone to the woods. Then well pleased on my havingrepaired to the woods, she will not entertain any apprehensionanent the righteous monarch, thinking that he isuntruthful. This is my first wish that my youngest mothermay obtain her son's kingdom, properous and well protectedby Bharata. Do thou, O Sumantra, bear thyself unto thepalace to compass the end of both the king and myself, anddo thou communicate in the desired way what I have saidunto the respective parties.\" Having said this unto thecharioteer and consoled him again and again, the energeticRāma spoke unto Guha the following words fraught withreason, \"O Guha, I should not now reside in a forestinhabited by men. I should certainly now abide in an asylumin proper guise. In harmony with the wishes of Sitā andLakshmana, I, imposing on myself in the interests of my fatherselfdenial and wearing that ornament of ascetics, a head ofmatted hair, will go (to the forest). Do thou therefore bringme starch from the banian.\" Thereupon Guha speedilybrought the starch for the prince; and prepared mattedlocks for himself, Rāma and Lakshmana. And that mighty-armed chief of men wore matted locks. And those brothersRāma and Lakshmana dressed as mendicants, and wearingheads of matted hair, appeared like saints. Then entering uponthe Vānaprastha mode of life, Rāma along with Lakshmanaassuming the vow of that life, observed unto that adherentof his, Guha,—\"Do thou, my friend, vigilantly protect thearmy, the exchequer, the fort and the provinces; for akingdom demands all the exertions (of the king thereof).\" Thentaking the permission of Guha, the descendant of Ikshwāku,holding his soul in calmness, set out with his wife andLakshmana. Seeing a boat at the river-side, that son of Ikshwākudesirous of crossing the swift-coursing Gangā, spoke thesewords,—\"Do thou ascend, gently, O foremost of men, the boatthat stayeth here, after the making the virtuous Sitā ascendby taking her by the hand.\" Hearing his brother's command,that strong-willed one, furthering everything, having madeMithilā's daughter ascend, ascended himself. That energeticelder brother of Lakshmana next ascended himself. Then thelord of the Nishādas, Guha, incited his kinsfolk. Havinggot on board the boat, the exceedingly puissant Rāghava forsecuring his welfare, recited mantras fit to be recited byKshatriyas and Brāhmanas. Then that mighty car-warrior,Lakshmana, sipping water from the river as laid downin the scriptures, bowed down to it along with Sitā ingladness of heart. Then telling Sumantra, Guha, and theforces, Rāma ascending the boat, ordered the boatmen(to proceed). Then the boat decked out by thehelmsman, moved by them, and urged on by the pulls of thegoodly oars, proceeded apace in the water. Havingarrived at the middle of the Bhāgirathi, that blameless one,Vaidehi, with joined hands, addressed the river, saying,—\"O Gangā, protected by thee, may the son of the intelligentand mighty monarch, Daçarātha, execute the mandate(of the latter.) Having spent complete fourteen yearsin the forest, he will return in company with his brother andmyself. Then, O worshipful one, O thou of auspiciousfortune, having returned safely, I will, O Gangā, worship thee,thou that crownst every desire. O thou that wendst in threeways, O revered one, thou envelopest the regions of Brahmā.Thou appearest in this world as the spouse of the Ocean-king. I will, O respected one, bow down unto thee, Obeauteous one, I will hymn thee, when, with good fortunereturned, the foremost of men has obtained the kingdom,I will to please thee give away unto Brāhmanas hundreds andthousands of kine, cloths, sapid rice, and vessels of wine bythousands, and pillaos. O worshipful one, I will worshipthee on Rāma having returned to the city. And I willworship all the gods that dwell on thy banks, as well as theholy spots and fanes, as soon as, O sinless one, thatmighty-armed one without sin will, coming back from hisabode in the forest, enter Ayodhyā in company withhis brother and myself.\" Having thus addressed theGangā, that blameless one ever obedient unto herhusband, swiftly went to the south bank (of the river). Goingto the (other) bank of the stream, that best of men, andsubduer of foes stood along with his brother and Vaidehi. Thenthat long-armed one spoke unto the enhancer of Sumitrā'sdelight, saying,—\"Be thou, whether in society or solitude,intent upon protecting Sitā. Of course it behoves us to protecther in lone places. Do thou, O son of Sumitrā, go ahead; andlet Sitā follow thee. I myself will go in your wake,protecting both yourself and Sitā. Surely, O foremost of men,we should now protect each other. We have not yetperformed any of the arduous tasks. Today Vaidehi willknow the grief of a life in the woods. And today she willenter the forest destitute of the concourse of men, devoid offields and gardens, uneven, and containing pits, etc.\"Hearing Rāma's words, Lakshmana went ahead; thatdescendant of Raghu, Rāma, followed Sitā."

  "Bālakāndam and Ayodhyākāndam": "On Rāma having speedily crossed the Gangā, thedistressed Sumantra who had been gazing at him stedfastly,being no longer able to discern him, turned away his eyesand, overcome with grief, shed tears. And having crossedthat mighty river, that high-souled one, that bestower ofboons, resembling in prowess a Lokapāla, without delayentered the flourishing and smiling Vatsas crowned withgoodly crops. And then the two (brothers) having slain thefour kinds of beasts, viz., boars, risyas, prishatas andmahārurus,149 and taking their flesh, in the evening took refugeunder a mighty tree, feeling the demands of appetite."

  "Bālakāndam and Ayodhyākāndam": "Having taken refuge under the tree and performed hisevening devotions, that foremost of those capable ofcharming others, Rāma, addressed Lakshmana, saying,—\"To dayis the first night (which we must spend) outside theinhabited tracts without the company of Sumantra. Thouought not to suffer thy mind to be uneasy on that score.From tonight forth, we shall have to guard her vigilantly;for, O Lakshmana, the preservation of what she has as wellas the securing unto her of what she has not, rests with us.We will, O son of Sumitrā, anyhow pass the night; let usourselves procuring (leaves) and spreading them on theground, anyhow lie down on it.\" Saying this, Rāmalying down on the ground although worthy of a costlybed, spoke these excellent words unto Sumitrā's son,—\"OLakshmana, surely the king sleeps uneasily to day, and Kaikeyihaving attained her end ought to be satisfied. Will notthat revered lady, for the purpose of having Bharataestablished in the kingdom, take the king's life, when she shallsee Bharata arrived? Forlorn and old and deprived of me,I do not know what he will do, his soul possessed by desire,and having come under the influence of Kaikeyi. Viewingthis calamity (that has overtaken us) and the disorder that hastaken place in the senses of the monarch, I deem even lustas more potent than either virtue or interest. O Lakshmana,what man is there ignorant though he be, who for the sake of afemale forsaketh as my father has done me, his sonfollowing his foot-steps? Ah! Kaikeyi's son Bharata with his wifeis really happy—he that enjoys the sole sovereignity of thedelighted Koçalas. Now that our father has grown old andI have taken refuge in the forest, he will alone experiencethe supreme felicity in the kingdom. He that renouncinginterest and virtue, followes lust, speedily gets himself involvedin troubles even like king Daçarātha. O amiable one, I thinkthat Kaikeyi has been born for making an end of Daçarātha,sending me into exile, and conferring the kingdom on Bharata.At present for imparting me pain, Kaikeyi intoxicated by thetide of good fortune, will afflict Kauçalyā and Sumitrā. Thymother, the revered Sumitrā, will be smitten with grief onour account. Do thou, Lakshmana, tomorrow morning repairunto Ayodhyā: I alone will go unto Dandaka along withSitā. Thou wilt be the protector of the helpless Kauçalyā.Kaikeyi is surely mean-minded, she perpetrates wrongsfrom malice. O thou cognizant of virtue, she mayadminister poison unto my mother. Surely, O child, in aformer birth, women were bereft of their sons by my mother,O son of Sumitrā; and it is for this that this misfortune hasbefallen her. Having been brought up and reared withgreat pains by Kauçalyā, I have left her at the time when herlabors ought to have borne fruit. Fie on me! Let no woman,son of Sumitrā, give birth unto a son like me who haveimparted such infinite pain unto my mother. O Lakshmana,I consider my mother's female parrot as more sharing heraffection, since she is heard to say, 'O Suka, do you bite thefoot of the foe?' What am I, O repressor of foes, now to do forher, bewailing, of slender fortune,—she that hath not profittedin the least by her son, and who stands in no further need ofhis good offices? Surely my unfortunate mother, Kauçalyā,bereft of me, lies down on the ground, overwhelmed willwoe, and plunged in an ocean of grief. O Lakshmana,enraged, I alone, without doubt, can rid Ayodhyā—the Earthherself—by means of my arrows. But improper is the displayof prowess for no reason. O sinless one, I am afraid ofunrighteousness and of the next life; and for this it is that,O Lakshmana, I do not install myself in the kingdom.\""

Thereupon Lakshmana consoled Rāmaspent with lamentation, like unto fire deprived of its radianceor the ocean of its tide. \"Surely, O Rāma, O foremost ofwarriors, on your having come out, the city of Ayodhyā isshorn of its splendour like the night deprived of the moon.This is not fit that you should grieve; for thereby, Oforemost of men, you make both Sitā and myself grieve.Rāghava, deprived of you neither Sitā nor I can live for amoment, like fish taken out of water : without you, Orepressor of foes, I wish to see neither my father, norSatrughna, nor Sumitrā, nor heaven itself.\" Then viewingfrom where they sat at ease their well-laid bed under thebanian, those virtuous ones (Rāma and Sitā) went to it.Hearing Lakshmana's excellent and appropriate words withwhich he gladly assumed a life in the woods, that subduer offoes, Rāghava, in the name of righteousness, at once follygranted him the permission to dwell with him for the entirefourteen years. Then like unto a couple of lions dwellingon a mountain-summit, at that lone spot of the extensiveforest, those powerful perpetuators of the Raghu race, beganto dwell without fear."

Then diving intoa mighty forest, they proceeded in the direction in which theBhāgirathi Gangā meets with the Yamunā. And thoseillustrious ones went on, viewing at intervals various fieldsand delightful lands which they had never seen before. Andgoing on beholding various kinds of blossoming trees, Rāmawhen the day had declined, spoke unto Sumitrā's son, saying,\"O son of Sumitrā, do thou behold the beautiful wreath ofsmoke that rises in front of Prayāga—sign of the worshipfulFire, and I infer some ascetic to be near. For certain wehave arrived at the confluence of the Gangā and the Yamunā;and it is for this that we hear the roar of the waters producedby the rushing of them. And all these various trees withtheir wood hewn away by foresters are seen in the asylums.\"Thus having proceeded at ease, those bowmen when thesun stood aslant, arrived in the vicinity of the ascetic'sresidence on the delta of the Yamunā and the Gangā. Andproceeding awhile on the way, Rāma, in presence of theasylum, came up to Bharadwāja's place, frightening beastsand birds. And arriving at the hermitage, the heroes desirousof seeing the ascetic, stood at a distance with Sitā behindthem. And as soon as entering in, that exalted one sawthat high-souled anchoret of accomplished vows, whohad attained spiritual insight through austerities, sittingsurrounded by his disciples after having finished theAgnihotrā, Rāma with joined hands saluted him alongwith Sumitrā's son and Sitā. Then Lakshmana's elderbrother imparted unto Bharadwāja a knowledge of himself.\"O worshipful one, we are the sons of Daçarātha, Rāmaand Lakshmana. This is my wife, the auspicious daughterof Janaka. This blameless one followeth me unto the solitaryforest; and my dear younger brother, the son of Sumitrātoo, observing the vow, follows me, who have been exiledby my father. O revered one, commissioned by my father,I will enter the forest of asceticism, and there subsisting onfruits and roots will practise virtue.\" Hearing those wordsof the intelligent prince, that righteous (ascetic) brought a bull150as well as arghya and water and divers kinds of ediblesconsisting of wild fruits and roots. And that one of fieryausterities assigned quarters, along with beasts and birds aswell as ascetics, for Rāma. Then paying homage unto Rāmaas he proceeded by short stages, and asking him,—\"Has yourjourney been a pleasant one?\"—the ascetic sat down. Andwhen Rāghava had sat down after receiving the homage,Bharadwāja spoke unto him these words fraught with virtue,—\"O Kākutstha, I behold thee come after a long time. I haveheard of thy causeless exile. This spot at the meeting of themighty rivers is lonely, sacred and charming. Do thou dwellhere happily.\" Thus addressed by Bharadwāja, that descendantof Raghu, Rāma intent on the welfare of all, answered inauspicious words,—\"O reverend one, I apprehend that, living hardby, the inhabitants of the city and the provinces, thinkingme as easily to be seen, will come to this asylum desirousof beholding me and Vaidehi. It is for this reason that livingat this place does not recommend itself unto me. Do thou,O worshipful one, hit upon a retired and agreeable asylumwhere Janaka's daughter worthy of happiness, will pass herdays pleasantly \" Hearing this auspicious speech of Rāghava,that eminent anchoret Bharadwāja said these words calculatedto serve Rāma's purpose,—\"Ten Krosas hence, my child,is the mountain where thou shalt dwell. It is inhabited bymaharshis, and is sacred, and picturseque throughout, aboundingin Golāngulas, monkeys, and bears,—known by the nameof Chitrakuta—resembling Gandhamādana. On beholdingthe peaks of Chitrakuta, one reaps welfare, and ignorancedoes not envelope one's mind. There innumerable saints withthe hair of their heads rendered white like skulls, having spenthundreds of years, have through austerities ascended heaven.That solitary spot I deem as one which will make a happyresidence for thee. O Rāma, do thou, for living out theterm of thy banishment, dwell either here or with me.\"Bharadwāja entertained his welcome guest, Rāma, alongwith his wife and brother by extending towards them everyrite of hospitality. And at Prayāga Rāma having obtainedthe company of that Maharshi, and discoursing on a varietyof sacred topics, the night came on. And with Sitā for thethird, Kākutstha brought up in luxury, being fatigued,pleasantly spent that night at the romantic hermitage ofBharadwāja. When the night had passed away and daydawned, (Rāma) approached Bharadwāja, and that chief ofmen addressed that ascetic of flaming energy,—\"O reverendsire of truthful character, we have here in thy asylum spentthe night. Do thou now permit us to set forward (forChitrakuta).\" On Rāma having passed the night there,Bharadwāja spoke unto him,—\"Do thou trace thy steps toChitrakuta filled with delicious fruits and roots. I deem that, Omighty Rāma, as a fit abode for thee, being, as it is, furnishedwith various kinds of trees, inhabited by crowds of Kinnaras,resounding with the cries of peacocks, and frequented bygignantic elephants. Do thou repair unto the famedChitrakuta, holy, fair to the view, and abounding in countless fruitsand roots. And in those forests range herds of elephantsand deer; and these, O Rāghava, thou wilt behold. Andranging with Sitā rivers and rills and plateaus, caverns andfountains, thy mind will experience delight. Delightedwith the notes of joyous Koyastivas and coels, and the criesof deer and countless mad elephants, do thou, arriving at theauspicious mountain, reside at that romantic asylum.\""

And seeing them about toset forth, that Maharshi performed a propitiatory ceremonyfor them, even as a father does on behalf of the sons begotfrom his own loins. And that mighty ascetic, Bharadwājahaving truth for his prowess, addressed them, saying,—\"Obest of men, do you coming to the confluence of the Gangāand the Yamunā proceed along the Kālindi river flowingwestwards. Arriving at the Kālindi running in a contrarydirection, you will, O Rāghava, behold a goodly bathing placewell-worn by foot-passengers. There constructing a raft,do you cross over the river who is the daughter of the Sun.Next coming to a gigantic banian tree with green foliage,named Syāma, surrounded by various trees and inhabited byascetics of accomplished purposes, let Sitā with joined handsoffer humble supplications to it. Having come to the treeand, whether staying under it or proceeding along, afterpassing only a Krosa, you will, O Rāma, see a wood aboundingin Sallakis, Vadaris, and other wild trees belonging untothe Yamunā. I went to Chitrakuta many a time by thatroad, which is beautiful, sandy, and free from forest-fire.\"Having directed the way, the Maharshi paused. ThereuponRāma, saying,—\"So be it\" asked him to stop. On theascetic turning away, Rāma spoke unto Lakshmana, \"We hadsurely acquired religious merit, good betide you, since, theascetic has shown compassion unto us.\" Having thusconversed with each other, those foremost of men endowedwith intelligence, placing Sitā in their front, proceededtowards the river Kālindi. And having arrived at the Kālindiof rapid currents, they desirous of crossing over, began Ithink (as to the means). Then with heaps of dry wild woodcovered with grass, they constructed a large raft. And thepuissant Lakshmana tearing twigs from the ratan and therose-apple, made a comfortable seat for Sitā. ThenDaçarātha's son, Rāma, made his bashful wife (in power)inconceivable like unto Sree herself, ascend the raft, and carefullylaid beside Vaidehi her attires and ornaments as well as thehoe and the basket. And first having placed Sitā on the raft,those sons of Daçarātha ascended themselves, and with gladhearts began carefully to cross (the stream). Having comenear the middle of the Kālindi, Sitā prayed unto her, saying,—\"Hail to thee, O goddess! I cross thee. If my husbandcan successfully perform his vow, I will worship thee with athousand cows and an hundred vessels of wine, hail untothee, upon Rāma's return to the city ruled by Ikshwāku.\"Having thus prayed to Kālindi with joined hands, thatvirtuous lady, Sitā, reached the southern bank thereof. Andby means of that raft they crossed that fleet-coursing daughterof the Sun, heaving with billows—the river Yamunā withher banks abounding with innumerable trees. Thenrenouncing the raft, and passing by the woods adjoining the Yamunā,they came upon a banian Syamā by name, of cool shade andverdant foliage. On coming to the banian, Vaidehi salutedit saying,—\"O mighty tree, I bow unto thee. May myhusband fulfil his vow; and may we behold Kauçalyā and theillustrious Sumitrā.\" Having thus prayed with joined hands,the intelligent Sitā went away. Seeing the blameless andbeloved Sitā ever conducting herself properly,—praying,Rāma said unto Lakshmana, \"Do thou, O younger brother ofBharata, taking Sitā with thee, go forward. O best of men,furnished with weapons, I will go in thy wake. Do thouprocure Vaidehi with whatever fruits or flowers may pleaseher and she may wish to have.\" Seeing every tree and shrubcrowned with blossoms unseen before, that one belongingto the softer sex questioned Rāma about it. And hearingSitā's words, Lakshmana brought unto her (fruits and flowers)of beautiful and flower-scattering trees of divers kinds. Andbeholding streams with water flowing over glittering sandsand resounding with cranes of various kinds, the daughter ofking Janaka felt exceeding delight. And having proceededjust a Krosa, those brothers, Rāma and Lakshmana, havingkilled many a sacred deer, began to range in the woodsof the Yamunā. And having disported in the beautiful woodsresounding with multitudes of peacocks and inhabited byelephants and monkeys, they looking as lively as ever, comingto the level banks of the river, took up their quarters there."

Then they all arising touched the sacred waters ofthe river, and began to proceed on the way to Chitrakutainhabited by ascetics. Setting out in season withSumitrā's son, he of eyes resembling lotus-petals spoke thesewords unto Sitā,—\"O Vaidehi, behold these flowering trees,the Kinsukas in spring appearing engarlanded with their ownflowers, and as if flaming.—Do thou behold the Bhallātakasand Vilwas bending beneath their fruits and flowers, with noman to enjoy them.

O amiableone, construct a dwelling. My mind is set upon stayinghere.\" Hearing his words, Sumitrā's son procured wood ofvarious descriptions, and then that subduer of foes reared acottage thatched with leaves.

Thereupon Rāma addressed himagain, \"Do thou cook this meat. We will worship thepresiding deities of this mansion. Bestir thyself,—the momentis mild and the day is styled Dhruva.\" Then Lakshmana theson of Sumitrā endowed with vigor, having slain a sacredblack deer, threw it into flaming fire. And seeing it wellscorched and hot and free from blood, Lakshmana spoke untothat foremost of men, Rāghava, saying,—\"Here is the entireblack deer roasted by me, capable of serving any purpose.Do you, O you that resemble a celestial, worship the gods.\"Having performed his ablutions, Rāma conversant with theritual and possessing a knowledge of Japa, restraining hissenses, performed all the mantras that are necessary forcompleting a sacrifice; and having in a pure spirit communedwith all the deities, entered the habitation.

Learning from envoys at(Sringaverapura) all about Rāma's visit to Bharadwāja atPrayāga and his reception (at Bharadwāja's place) as well astheir destined journey (to Chitrakuta), Sumantra, taking thepermission (of Guha), yoked those excellent horses and witha heavy heart directed his course to the city of Ayodhyā.And beholding perfumed woods and rivers and wateryexpanses and towns and villages, he eagerly proceeded onhis way. And on the third day at dusk the charioteerarriving at Ayodhyā saw it bereft of happiness. Andbeholding it empty and still, Sumantra afflicted with exceedingsorrow, and overwhelmed with grief, thought, \"Perhaps thecity with her elephants and horses and men and king hasbeen consumed by the fire of grief on account of Rāma.\"Having thus reflected, the charioteer drawing up to the city-gate by means of those fleet-coursing horses, speedilyentered the city. Thereupon, people by hundreds andthousands rushed after the charioteer, Sumantra, asking,\"Where is Rāma?\" To them he replied,—\"Having askedRāghava on the Gangā and being permitted by him, I havebeen sent away by that high-souled righteous one.\" Learningthat they (Rāma and the rest) had crossed over (the Gangā),the men with tears in their eyes, sighed forth \"O fie!\" andbegan to bewail, exclaiming, \"Ah Rāma.\" And he heardcrowds exclaim,—\"Not seeing Rāma in the car, we cease toexist. We shall no longer see the righteous Rāma in themidst of mighty assemblies engaged in charity, sacrifice ornuptial rites. What was necessary for this body? Whatwas dear to them and what did they delight in?—(constantlyrevolving all this in his mind), Rāma ruled this city even as,a father. Then proceeding past the stalls, Sumantra heardthe lamentations of females at windows, burning in grief forRāma. With his face muffled, Sumantra proceeded on thehighway towards the palace of Daçarātha. Swiftly alightingfrom the car and entering the royal residence, he wentpast seven apartments thronged with people. And beholdingSumantra returned to the city crowned with edifices, seven-storied houses, and palatial mansions, the women, strickenwith the absence of Rāma, set up a cry of \"Oh\" and \"Alas.\"And waxing still more aggrieved, the females looked at eachother with their expansive and transparent eyes fast floodedwith tears. And then he heard the talk, as toned down itproceeded from the royal mansions, of the wives of Daçarāthaafflicted with grief for Rāma. \"Going in company withRāma, and returning without him, what will the charioteeranswer Kauçalyā bewailing (for her son)? Surely life ismiserable, yet is incapable of being renounced, since, althoughher son leaving (the installation) hath gone away, yetKauçalyā still liveth.\" Having heard those words of thequeens, fraught with truth, Sumantra burning as it werein grief, at once entered the (next) apartment. And enteringthe eighth apartment he beheld in a gloomy chamber theking distressed and in a pitiable plight, woe-begone for grieffor his son. Thereupon presenting himself before themonarch, Sumantra saluted him and then conveyed unto theking the words of Rāma as he had uttered them. Hearingthem silently, the monarch with his mind exceedinglywrought, dropped down to the ground in a swoon, afflictedwith grief for Rāma. On the lord of earth swooning awayand falling to the ground, the inmates of the inner apartmentraising their arms burst into lamentations. Kauçalyā availingherself of the aid of Sumantra, raised up her fallen lord andaddressed him, saying, \"This, O eminently virtuous one! ifthe envoy of that one of an exceedingly arduous achievement,returned from the forest. Why do you not accost him?O descendant of Raghu, you are ashamed to-day, having donethis wrong. Do you rise: merit be yours (arising from thisact.) Let not your adherents come to naught (because ofyour sorrow). O worshipful one, she from fear of whomyou do not speak to the charioteer, Kaikeyi, is not here.Do you therefore speak to him without fear.\" Having saidthis unto the monarch, Kauçalyā overwhelmed with grief,with her voice oppressed with the vapour begot of emotion,all on a sudden fell to the earth. Beholding Kauçalyā fallenon the ground bewailing, as also their husband, the ladiesseated around, began to lament. Hearing the sounds ofwailing arise from the inner apartment, old and young aswell as females, set up lamentations all round; and the citywas again filled with them."

  "Bālakāndam and Ayodhyākāndam": "When having been ministered unto and when his senseshad returned after the swoon, the king summoned Sumantrafor hearing tidings of Rāma. Thereupon the charitoteerwith joined hands spoke unto the mighty monarch,lamenting for Rāma, influenced by grief and sorrow, aged, burningin grief, like a newly-taken elephant, sighing heavily,plunged in thought, and resembling an elephant that is indisposed.Then the king like one exceedingly distressed, spoke untothe charioteer, who had presented himself, covered over withdust, with tears starting from his eyes, and in pitiable guise,\"Where stayeth that righteous one, taking refuge under atree? Lapped in luxury, what, O charioteer, will Rāghavafeed on? Unworthy of privations, and worthy of excellentbeds, how, O Sumantra, a king's son, he is sleeping on theground like one forlorn? How is Rāma passing his days inthe lone forest—he who when he went out used to be followedby foot-men and elephants? How are the princes in companywith Vaidehi, living in the woods, ranged by serpentsand beasts and inhabited by black snakes? How, O Sumantra,having descended from the car, the princes along withthe tender and unfortunate Sitā are proceeding on foot? Ocharioteer, surely thou art blessed, for thou hast beheld mysons enter the forest, like the Açwins entering the Mandarahill. And what did Rāma say? And what did Lakshmana?And, O Sumantra, arriving at the forest what did Mithilā'sdaughter? Do thou, O charioteer, describe unto me what Rāmalives on and where he lies down. Hearing this, I shall live,like Yayati in the midst of saints.\" Thus urged by the king,the charioteer spoke unto the king with his voice falteringand suppressed with the vapour of grief, \"O mighty monarchobserving morality, Rāghava with joined hands and bowingdown his head, said, 'O charioteer, do thou in my namesalute with thy head the feet of my high-soulded sire worthyof being saluted, and famed (in the world). And, O charioteer,do thou in my name as each deserves salute the ladiesof the inner apartment and communicate to them tidingsof my health. And having saluted my mother Kauçalyāand conveyed unto her news of my welfare, as well as of myunswerving adherence to morality, do thou tell her thewords,— Do you remaining steady in virtue, at the properhour bestir yourself in behalf of the chamber of sacrificialfire. And, O revered one, do you minister unto the feetof that worshipful one, (the king), as if they were verydeities. And banishing pride and self-love, do you bearyourself towards my mothers. And, O mother, do you showrespect unto Kaikeyi, who is followed by the king himself.And you should behave towards Bharata as one shouldtowards one's king. Kings (although juvenile), are reallysenior by virtue of their royalty; and do you remember theduties touching sovereigns.'—Do thou communicate untoBharata news of my welfare and say in my name,—Do youbehave properly with all your mothers.—And unto thatdelight of the Ikswhāku line do thou further say,—Havingbeen installed as the heir-apparent, be you, looking upon theking as the supreme authority in the state, obedient to him.Do you not deprive the king of authority, as he has grown old.O Prince, do you grant him satisfaction in the kingdom anddo you proclaim his mandates.— And shedding copious tears,he again addressed me, saying,—Do thou look upon my motheras on thy own proud of her son.—Having said this, themighty-armed and illustrious Rāma furnished with eyesresembling lotus-petals, shed plenteous tears. ThereuponLakshmana waxing wroth, breathing hard, said,—For what faultof his has the Prince been banished? Observing the worthlesscommand of Kaikeyi, whether the king has done well or ill,we have been exceedingly pained thereby. Whether Rāmahas been exiled through Kaikeyi's lust for dominion or throughthe exigencies of the bestowal of the boon, there cannot beany doubt that the king has acted most unrighteously. Evenif this hath been done in harmony with the wish of the Lord, Ido not perceive any reason for the banishment of Rāma.The king through lack of sense has done heedlessly whatis opposed to morality; and this banishment of Rāma willbut bring upon him woe here and hereafter. Fatherhoodfind I none in the monarch. My brother and feeder and friendand father is even Rāghava. Renouncing one that isuniversally dear, and that is ever engaged in the good of all,how by such an act will the king please the people? Andhow by banishing the righteous Rāma dear unto all thesubjects, and thus withstanding the wishes of all, will heretain his royalty?—And, O mighty monarch, Janaki also,unfortunate that she is, sighing heavily, stood wildered likeone that had been possessed. And not having experiencedany calamity before, the famed princess weeping because ofthis misfortune, told me nothing. And looking up to herlord with a blank countenance, she suddenly let fail tears,perceiving the destruction of the subjects. And thus saidRāma ministered unto by Lakshmana, with a tearful countenance;and thus stood the unfortunate and weeping Sitābeholding the royal car and myself.\""

And having (done homage) unto both theprinces by joining my hands, I turned my back, bearingbest I could that load of sorrow. Indulging in the hope thatRāma might again summon me by any of the envoys (of Guhaleft there), I stayed there with Guha for many days. In thydominions, O monarch, exercised by the calamity that hasbefallen Rāma, even trees bearing blossoms and buds andsprouts look sad; the rivers and pools and liquid lapses havetheir waters dried up; and the woods and groves have theirfoliage withered. Creatures do not move and beasts of preycease to range about; and the forest appears to be dumb,stupified by grief on account of Rāma. And streams containinglotuses with their leaves shriveled, have their watersstained; and lotuses have their leaves burnt; and fishes and(aquatic) birds have grown lean. And flowers both on land andwater have been deprived of their freshness and fragrance;and they no longer retain their former condition. Andthe gardens are idle with their birds drooping. And, O bestof men, I do not find the bowers beautiful (as before). Andwhen I entered Ayodhyā, none greeted me. And not seeingRāma, the people sigh momentarily. And, O revered one,seeing the royal car returned hither without Rāma, the peopleon the highways from grief appear with tearful countenances.And from mansions, cars, and lorldly edifices, ladies seeingthe car come back, set up a chorus of 'Ah' and 'Alas,' afflictedwith the absence of Rāma. And becoming more distressedthan ever, the fair sex with their expansive and clear eyesfilled with tears, began to eye each other indistinctly. Andin consequence of the general grief that prevailed, I could notperceive any difference between friends and foes and personsindifferent. O mighty monarch, distressed in consequence ofthe exile of Rāma, men appear sunk in dejection, and elephantsand horses are spiritless; and seized with cheerlessness,they utter doleful sounds and heave profound sighs. Ayodhyāappeareth unto me joyless like Kauçalyā deprived of herson.\" Hearing the words of the charioteer, the king like oneexceedingly forlorn, addressed the former in words lost in thevapour of sorrow, \"Exhorted by Kaikeyi of a sinful country,born in a sinful race and cherishing sinful designs, I did nottake counsel with aged people capable of offering advice. Withoutconsulting with friends or courtiers or persons versed in theVedas, I have in the interests of a woman rashly done thisthing through ignorance. Meseems, O charioteer, for thepurpose of destroying this line entirely, this mighty disaster hathsurely befallen us through the influence of Destiny. Ocharioteer, if I have ever done thee any good, do thou immediatelytake me to Rāma: my life urges me on (in this direction). Orlet my command make Rāghava turn back. I cannot live for amoment without Rāma. But if that mighty-armed one hasproceeded far, do thou placing me on a car speedily show meunto Rāma. Where is that elder brother of Lakshmana of amighty bow, furnished with teeth resembling Kunda flowers?If I live so long, I will behold him in company with Sitā.What can be sadder than this, that reduced to such a pass,I cannot see here that descendant of Ikshwāku, Rāghava?Ah Rāma! Ah thou younger brother of Rāma! Ah thouunfortunate Vaidehi! You do not know that I am throughgrief lamenting like one deserted.\" Deprived of hisconsciousness through that sorrow of his, the king said, \"I haveplunged myself into this ocean of woe hard to cross, withgrief for Rāma as its mighty tide; separation from Sitā, itsother shore; sighs heaved, its furious billows and whirlpools;tears, rivers that rush into it; tossing of the arms, its fishes;lamentations its roar; my hair flung about, its moss; Kaikeyi,its submarine fire; my fast-flowing tears, its current;the words of the hump-backed one, its terrific ravenousanimals; the boon, its continents; and the exile of Rāma, itsexpanse. And, O Kauçalyā, without Rāghava, I shall sinkin this ocean. O exalted dame, living, it is hard for me tocross over this ocean. It is surely owing to my sin that todaywishing to behold Rāghava and Lakshmana, I do not getthem (before me).\" Having thus lamented, the illustrious kingall of a sudden dropped to the earth in a swoon. On the kingswooning away lamenting, that exalted lady, Rāma's mother,hearing his words doubly bitter and more piteous than etiuttered for Rāma, was seized with fresh apprehension."

Do thou without delayturn the car. Do thou take me also unto Dandaka. If I donot follow them, I shall repair to the mansion of Yama.\" Thereatthe charioteer with joined hands comforted that exalted ladywith ready words faltering and choked with rising vapour,\"Do you leave grief and sorrow and the violent emotion.Renouncing grief, Rāghava is living in the woods. And in theforest, the righteous Lakshmana, having his senses undercontrol, is ministering unto Rāma's feet and is thus adoringthe gods for happiness in the next world. And even in thelonely woods, Sitā as if remaining at home, having fixed herthoughts on Rāma, is living a life of love. And there appearsnot the least trace of any distress afflicting her; and Vaidehiseems to me as if she were meant (by Nature) for a lifeaway from home. And as formerly going unto urban villasshe disported, she disports now even in the lonely forest.And although living in the lone forest, that one of acountenance resembling the infant moon, sports merrily like agirl, in the garden represented by Rāma's self. Ayodhyāwithout Rāma would have seemed a wilderness to her whoseheart is fixed on him and whose very life depends upon him.Vaidehi is now asking (Rāma) concerning the villages andtowns (in their way); and observing various trees and thecourses of the rivers, Jānaki, asking Rāma or Lakshmana(for information), is learning all about them. And Sitā sportsas she used to do in arbours stationed at the distance ofonly one krosa from Ayodhyā. This only I remember; butall that she had from sudden impulse communicated untome concerning Kaikeyi, does not rise into consciousness.\"Suppressing this topic which had come up throughheedlessness, the charioteer spoke sweet words cheering up thatnoble lady. \"Neither through the fatigue of travel, nor theinfluence of the wind, nor excitement, nor the sun, hathVaidehi's lustre resembling the lunar light suffered anydiminution. The countenance of that fair-speaking oneresembling the lotus and comparable unto the full moonin splendour, hath not waxed pale. Her feet now withoutthe dye of the liquid lac, but naturally furnished with theroseate hue of the same, are gorgeous like lotus buds.Still Vaidehi decked in ornaments from affection for Rāma,goes gracefully, rebuking with her bangles the wavy gait(of cranes). Supporting herself on Rāma's arm, Sitā arrivedat the forest, is not inspired with fear on beholding eitheran elephant, or a lion, or a tiger. Therefore they are not to bebewailed, nor your own self, nor the lord of men. Thishistory of Rāma will endure for ever in this world. Renouncinggrief and with cheerful hearts, well established in thelife led by the Maharshis, they living in the forest on wildfruits as their sustenance, are maintaining the noble promiseof their sire.\" Consoled by the truth-telling yet sweeet-speeched charioteer, that lady oppressed with grief forher son, ceased not to wail loudly—\"My beloved,\" \"My son,\"\"Rāghava.\""

Why then have you forsakenthose foremost of men along with Sitā? Brought up inhappiness, and now brought to misery, how can they bear it?And how can the youthful daughter of Mithilā of slendermake, tender, and deserving of happiness, bear heat and cold?Having formerly partaken of (excellent) rice with curries, howwill Sitā feed on wild rice? Having heard excellent vocal andinstrumental music, how will Sitā hear the frightful cries ofcarnivorous lions? Resembling the gonfalon of the great Indra,where sleepeth the mighty-armed and exceedingly powerfulRāma, making his arm like unto a mace his pillow? Whenshall I behold Rāma's countenance hued like the lotus, withhis hair ending beautifully (in curls), and his breath impregnatedwith the fine perfume of the lotus, and his eyes resemblinglotus leaves? Surely my heart, without doubt, is made ofthe essence of the thunderbolt, since not beholding him, it isnot cracked in a thousand fragments. It is because ofyour sad act that mine own, being thwarted, although worthyof happiness, are miserably ranging the wilderness. If afterthe expiration of the five and ten years, Rāghava does return,it does not appear likely that Bharata will renounce thekingdom and the exchequer. Some on the occasions of theSrāddha (first) feast their own friends, and having done this,they mind the choice Brāhmanas. But those twice-bornones that are meritorious, learned, and like unto celestials, donot at the last moment regard even viands resemblingambrosia. Brāhmanas of high respectibility endowed withwisdom never bear being entertained after the other twice-born ones have been feasted, even as bulls never quietly bearto have their horns cut off. Why will not an elder brotherand one who has sterling merits, O monarch, disregard akingdom which hath been thus enjoyed by his youngerbrother? A tiger doth not like to feed on food procured byothers. Even so that tiger-like personage does not regardanything that has come to be tasted by another. Clarifiedbutter, sacrificial cakes, Kuça, stakes of catechu having beenused in one sacrifice cannot be used in another,—even sothis kingdom which hath been already enjoyed, like untoliquor deprived of its essence or a sacrifice whose soma hathbeen eaten, cannot be accepted by Rāma. Such an illtreatment Rāghava will not put up with, even as a powerful tigercannot bear the rubbing of its tail (by another). This worldaided by the gods fear to encounter him in high conflict;but he restrains himself, thinking any such action on his part asunrighteous. Indeed, that righteous one brings back peopleto morality. Surely, that mighty-armed one endowed withexceeding prowess, can with his golden shafts burn allcreatures and the oceans, like the Day at the dissolution of all. Butsuch a man of men, possessed of leonine strength, and gracedwith the eyes of a bull, has been destroyed by his father,like a fish destroying his offspring. If you had believed in themorality prescribed in the scriptures, and which is followedby the twice-born ones, you would not have banished yourson. But disregarding such morality, you have banishedyour virtuous son. One of the refuges of a woman is herhusband, a second is her son, and a third is her relatives; anda fourth she has none. But you cease to be mine; and Rāmahas been sent to the woods. I do not like to go into theforest; so I am entirely undone by you. This kingdom, yourown kingdom, has been destroyed by you; destroyed are;along with the counsellors; destroyed am I with my son; anddestroyed are the citizens: your son and your wife are alonedelighted.\" Hearing these words uttered in heart-rendingaccents, Daçarātha exceedingly distressed, became senseless.And being afflicted with grief, he again remembered his evilact."

Having thoughtfor a long while, that repressor of foes, the king, who hadlost his senses through grief, regained consciousness. Andhaving regained his senses, he sighing hot and hard, seeingKauçalyā beside him, was again lost in thought. As he wasthinking, the sinful act which he had through ignoranceformerly committed by means of the shaft which hits bysound, rose up (in his recollection). Afflicted with this griefas well as that on account of Rāma, that lord, the king, burnedin these two several griefs. Burning in grief and distressed,he trembling and with joined hands, with his head hangingdown, addressed Kauçalyā, with the view of pacifying her,\"I deprecate thy displeasure, O Kauçalyā, with joined hands.Thou art ever affectionate and dost not treat harshly evenenemies. Verily unto women cognizant of virtue, a husband,whether he has any merits or not, is a very deity. Evervirtuous, thou, that hast seen both the virtuous and the vicious,although aggrieved, ought not to say anything unpleasantunto me who am weighed down with woe.\" Having heardthese piteous words of the distressed king, Kauçalyā utteredwords even as a water-way lets out fresh accession of rain.And weeping, she drew on her head the joined hands of theking resembling lotuses; and then flurried spoke these wordshurriedly informed with extreme affection, \"Be thoupropitious; I beseech with (bended) head. I bow unto thee,falling on the ground. O reverend one, besought by thee,I shall be undone. I do not deserve to be forgiven bythee. She cannot be reckoned a gentlewoman, who ispropitiated by her intelligent husband, worthy of beingextolled in both the worlds. I know duty, O righteous one;I know that thou art truth-telling. And it is because I wasexceedingly distressed on account of my son that I spokeharshly to thee. Sorrow destroys patience, sorrow destroysknowledge of the scriptures, sorrow destroys every thing;there is no enemy like unto sorrow. One can falling down bearbeating from an enemy; but one cannot falling down bearever so little sorrow. This is the fifth night of the banishmentof Rāma, as calculated by me; and to me rendered cheerlessby sorrow, this interval has assumed the proportions of fiveyears. And fostered by thought on my part, this griefincreases in my bosom, like the mighty waters of the oceanincreased by the vehement discharge of rivers.\" As Kauçalyāwas thus speaking auspiciously, the rays of the sun grewmilder, and the night arrived.

And in consequence of the exile of Rāma andLakshmana, the king resembling Vāsava was overpowered by grief,like the darkness of Rāhu enveloping the sun. Then on Rāma'shaving gone along with his wife, the lord of the Koçalas,remembering his own misdeed, felt anxious to communicatehimself to that lady having her eyes furnished with dark outercorners. And on the sixth night after Rāma had repaired to theforest, the king Daçarātha, when it was midnight, rememberedhis own unrighteous act. And then unto Kauçalyā aggrieved onaccount of her son, he spoke these words, \"As are the actionsof one, O auspicious one—whether good or otherwise—are the consequences, O gentle lady, reaped by the doerof them. He that on the eve of beginning an actioneither relating to this world or the next, does nottake into consideration the fact that actions entailconsequences light or grave, disagreeable (or otherwise), isstyled a child. He that cutting down a mango grove, watersPalāsa trees, beholding the flowers (blooming), will covetfruits; and grieve when their season arrives. The personthat without apprehending (the principle of causation) rushesto action, grieves at the season of fruits, even like himthat watereth kinsuka trees (hewing down his mango grove).And in this way, I fool that I am having hewn down my grove ofmangos and watered Palāças,—having renounced Rāma in theseason of fruit, is grieving in the end. Having, O Kauçalyā,earned the expression—'The Prince can pierce his aim bysound alone,'—I, a prince and bowman, did this offence.Therefore, O noble dame, I have myself brought this misfortune onme. like a child who has eaten poison through ignorance. Andeven like another person fascinated by the sight of somePalāsa trees (and doing as mentioned above), I (did this act)not foreknowing the consequence that would follow myshooting by sound. O lady, thou wert then unwedded; and I was ayouthful prince. And it was at this time that the rainy seasonincreasing my desire set in. Drawing moisture from theground and heated the earth by his rays, the Sun goes to thedreadful quarter whither repair the dead. The heat wasimmediately dispelled, and the gelid clouds showed themselves;and frogs and Sārangas and peacocks began to rejoice; and,finding it unpleasant, the feathered ones bathed and with thesurface of their plumage shrunk up from the wet, took refugein trees shaken by the wind and rain. And the hill graced bymaddened Sārangas, covered by showers fallingsimultaneously looked like a mass of waters. And the watersalthough unstained, being mixed up with mineral substancesand ashes from the mountain, flowed in serpentine torrentsblack and red. At such a sweet hour, I intent upon takingexcercise, taking my bow and arrows and mounted on mycar, sallied out for the river Sarayu, with the intention thatI with my senses under control, should in the watery expenseslay any bufifelo, elephant, or any other beast that might havecome there in the night. And (coming there) while it wasso dark that nothing could be discovered, I heard soundsof a filling pitcher proceeding from the waters;resembling the roars of an elephant. Thereupon raising up myshaft flaming and like unto a serpent of virulent poison, Idesirous of hunting the (imaginary) elephant, let fly my shaft inthe direction of the sound. Thereupon from the spot wheretothe sharpened shaft resembling a poisonous snake had beendischarged by me in the twilight, proceeded cries of 'Oh' and'Alas' uttered by a forester pierced to the quick by the arrow,and falling into the water. And when he had dropped down,words spoken by a human being became audible. 'Why doththe weapon light upon me? I had come to this lone streamfor procuring water. By whom have I been wounded bythis arrow? To whom have I done wrong? And how can theslaying of one like me bearing a load of matted locks, and wearingbark and deer-skin, who subsists on what the forest yieldsand never injures others, be sanctioned by the scriptures?Who can serve any purpose by slaying me? And how can Ihave injured such an one? Such a purposeless act cannot butend in evil. This can never be reckoned as righteous; even likeunto violating the chastity of a preceptor's wife. I do not somuch lament my end as I lament it on account of my fatherand mother. To what will the old couple, who have everbeen maintained by me, betake themselves when I am gone?My father and mother are old, and I their only son am slain.What boy is it of uncontrolled senses that has killed us all?\""

And coming to the quarter, I exceedinglyunnerved and with an excited mind, discovered on the banksof the Sarayu an ascetic wounded with a shaft, with his mattedlocks scattered about, his pitcher of water lying by, hisbody smeared with blood and dust and afflicted by the dart.Gazing with his eyes at me who was extremely agitated and illat ease, he said these words sternly, as if consuming me withhis energy, 'What wrong, O monarch, had I residing in thewoods done thee, that coming to procure water for my parents,I have been thus afflicted by thee? By piercing my marrowwith a shaft, thou hast slain both my aged and blind father andmother. Surely, they feeble and blind, who afflicted by thirstare remaining in expectation of me, will now bear (the stressand tension of) the expectation as well as the parching thirst.Surely asceticism and study carry no fruit with them, sinceI lying low on the ground, my father knows nothing aboutit. And what could he do, even if he knew it, being as he isincapable and unable to go about? One tree cannot rescueanother that is being batttered (by the winds). Do thou, Odescendant of Raghu, thyself going to my father, speedilyinform of him this that has occurred. But take care that like afire waxing furious consuming a wood, he in his ire do notburn thee. This narrow way, O king, will lead thee unto myfather's dwelling. Do thou going there, pacify him, so thatgetting wroth he may not curse thee. Do thou (now), O king, takeout the arrow. Thy sharpened shaft afflicts my marrow, like thetide of a river wearing away a hollow-heaving sand bank.'But touching the extracting of the arrow, this thoughtperplexed me: 'If the arrow is left alone, it pains; ifextracted, death ensues.' As I was distressed, aggrieved andinflicted with sorrow, the son of the ascetic perceived myanxiety. Thereupon that one well versed in the scripturessinking motionless, with his eyes rolling upwards, andwaxing extremely weak, said with difficulty, 'Restrainingsorrow, I by dint of patience become calm. Do thou removefrom thy mind the grief caused by the consciousness of havingslain a Brāhmana. O king, I belong not to the twice-bornrace: let not thy mind be pained. O lord of the foremostmen, I was begot by a Vaicya on a Sudra woman.' As he,his vitals afflicted with the shaft, his eyes rolling, inert andtrembling on the ground, with his limbs drawn in, wasspeaking with difficulty, I drew out the arrow. Thereupon,looking at me, the ascetic, growing affrighted, gave up theghost. On beholding him with his body dripping with water,and mortally wounded, and breathing hard without respite,after he had bewailed his mortal wound, lying on thebanks of the Sarayu, I lamented him and was, O gentlelady, greatly aggrieved.\""

Thentaking up the pitcher filled with excellent water, I wentby the way mentioned and (at last) reached the asylum.There I found his aged, infirm, forlorn, parents, without aone to help them in moving about,—like unto birds whosewings have been severed, keeping up a talk about (their son)without experiencing any fatigue, and like helpless onesfeeding on a hope which had been blasted by me. My sensesoverpowered by grief, and my consciousness almost lostthrough apprehension, I, arrived at the hermitage, was againoverwhelmed with sorrow. Hearing my footsteps, theascetic said, 'Why, my son, delayest thou? Bring the drinkat once. Thy mother, O child, was exceedingly anxious inconsequence of thy sporting in the waters. Do thou speedilyenter the asylum. O child, it behoveth thee not to take toheart any unkind action that, O son, may have been doneunto thee of high fame either by thy mother or myself. Thouart the resource of these helpless ones; thou art the eyesof these bereft of their sight. Our lives are bound up withthee. Why dost not answer?' Seeing the ascetic with achoked utterance indistinctly speaking thus with the lettersnot articulated clearly, I, dashed in spirits, yet concealing thereal state of my mind by assuming a doughty tongue,communicated unto him the danger that had beffallen him inconsequence of the calamity of his son: 'I am a Kshatria,Daçarātha (by name), and no son of thine, O magnanimous one.I have come by a misfortune in consequence of an act blamedby the good. O revered one, desirous of killing somebeast of prey, an elephant (or some other), come to the waters,I went to the banks of the Sarayu bow in hand. Thenhearing sounds from the water of a filling pitcher, I thought,—Thismust be an elephant.—I wounded it with a shaft. Next comingto the edge of the river, I saw an ascetic lying down on theground almost deprived of life, with his heart pierced withan arrow. Then coming forward, I in accordance with thedirection given by him as he lay in agony, suddenlyextracted the arrow from his vitals. And as soon as the arrow hadbeen extracted, he ascended heaven, O reverend sir, lamentingand bewailing you, both grown old. It is through ignorancethat I suddenly wounded your son. This having been past,do you favor me with telling me what is now to be done,O ascetic.' Having heard these cruel words, the worshipfulascetic could well by his curse consume me to ashes. Witheyes flooded with tears, and well nigh deprived of his sensesby grief, that highly energetic one said unto me standingwith joined hands, 'If, O king, thou hadst not of thyselfimmediately communicated unto us this unpleasant news, thyhead would have been reduced to a thousand flaws. Not tospeak of Kshatriyas, I can even drag the very weilder of thethunderbolt himself from his position, if he knowingly killsone, in especial, that has assumed the Vanaprastha mode oflife. Thy head would have been severed in seven, if thouhadst discharged the weapon knowingly at such an asecticstaying in austerities and versed in the Vedas. It is becausethou hast done this through ignorance that thou (still) livest,else the race itself of the Rāghavas should be not,—andwhere art thou?' He then said, 'Do thou, O king, take usto the scene. To day will we look our last on our sonbesmeared with blood, his deer-skin garb falling off (from hisbody), lying senseless on the earth, and come under thesubjection of the lord of righteousness.' Thereupon I alonetaking them exceedingly disconsolate to the spot, made theascetic and his wife touch their son. And having approachedtheir son and touched him, those ascetics fell on his person,and then his father addressed him thus, 'Thou salutestme not to-day, nor dost thou speak to me. Why, my child,dost thou lie down on the ground? Art thou angry (with us)?If, my son, thou dost not feel kindly to me, do thou look upto thy virtuous mother. And why, O son, dost thounot embrace me? Do a thou speak tender words. At thesmall hours, from whom engaged in study, shall I hear thescriptures sweetly read in a way coming home to the listener'smind? Who, having performed his daily devotions andoffered oblations unto the sacrificial fire, will bathe me, afflictedwith grief for my son? And who procuring Kandas, fruitsand roots, will feed me like an welcome guest, incapable ofdoing anything and furnishing provisions, and without anyone to take care of myself? And, my son, how will Imaintain this blind ascetic mother of thine, proud of her son,who is passing her days in misery? Do thou stay, myson, in my behalf. Tomorrow thou wilt go to Yama's mansionwith me and thy mother. Distressed with grief and renderedmiserable in the forest, both of us deprived of thee shall soonrepair to the abode of Yama. Seeing Vivaswata's son, I willsay unto him,—Do thou, O lord of justice, forgiveme, and let this my son continue to maintain us, hisparents. It behoves thee, O righteous and illustriousguardian of the worlds, to confer on me reduced to such a passthis one enduring dakshinā capable of removing our fear.—Thou, my son, art sinless, although slain by this one who hasdone an unrighteous act; and by the force of this truth, dothou repair to the world of warriors. Do thou, O son, gothe supreme way that is gone by heroes who without turningback from the fight, are slain in open encounter. Do thou,O son, go the way that has been gone by Sagara and Saivyaand Dilipa and Janamejaya and Nahusa and Dhundumāra.Do thou, O son, go the way that is gone by all creatures! evenby ascetics engaged in the study of the Veda, by bestowersof lands, by those performing fire-sacrifices, by individuals eachdevoted to a single wife, men giving away a thousand kine,persons tending their preceptors, and individuals renouncinglives by fasting. He that is born in such a race cannotcome by any evil case. Such a condition be his that hastaken the life of thee, my friend.'"

Then (returning) along with Sakra, the asceticcomforting his aged parents, addressed them, saying, 'I haveattained a high state in consequence of having served you.Do you also without delay come unto me.' Having said this,the ascetic's son of restrained senses ascended heaven bymeans of an excellent and commodious car. Havingperformed the watery rites, the highly energetic ascetic alongwith his wife speedily said unto me staying with joinedhands, 'Do thou, O monarch, slay me on the instant. I do notgrieve to die'—thou hast by thy shaft rendered me who hadan only son, absolutely sonless. Since this sorrow arising fromthe calamity that has befallen my son, is at present mine(through thy instrumentality), I curse thee,—thou shalt evenin this way find thy death from grief for thy son. As thoua Kshatriya hast through ignorance slain an ascetic, the sin,O lord of men, of slaying a Brāhmana will not envelope theespeedily; but thou shalt shortly come by this dreadful andmortal condition, like a donor of Dakshinās (coming by thethings given away).' Having thus inflicted on me the curseand piteously lamented long, the couple ascended thefuneral pile and went to heaven. O noble dame, the crime thatI hitting by help of sound, had committed in my boyhood,has reverted to my recollection in course of thought. And,O exalted lady, even as a disease generated by one's takingrice with unhealthy curry, this danger is imminent inconsequence of that act. O gentle one, the words of that noble-minded person are about to be verified in me.\" Having saidthis and weeping, the king said to his wife, \"I shall renouncelife through grief for my son. And I shall no more behold theewith my eyes. Do thou, O Kauçalyā, touch me. Peoplegoing to the mansion of Yama no more behold (their friends).If Rāma touch me directly or otherwise, obtain theexchequer, and be installed as the heir-apparent, meseems, I mayyet live. O noble lady, what I have done unto Rāghava isnot surely like myself; but what (on the other hand) he hasdone by me is worthy of him. What sensible man forsakethhis son, albeit he may be wicked? And what son beingbanished, does not bear ill will towards his father? But I donot see thee with my eyes, and my memory fails. Theseenvoys of Vivaswata's son, O Kauçalyā, urge speed upon me.What can be an object of greater regret than, that I duringmy last moments cannot behold the righteous Rāma havingtruth for prowess? Even as the sun drieth up a drop ofwater, grief for not seeing my son of incomparable acts driethmy spirits. Those are not men—those are gods who in thefifteenth year shall again behold Rāma's countenance gracedwith elegent and burnished ear-rings. O thou of gracefuleye-brows, blessed are they who shall behold Rāma'scountenance furnished with eyes resembling lotus-petals, withexcellent teeth and a shapely nose, like unto the lord of thestars himself. Blessed are they that shall behold that fragrantface of his like unto the autumnal moon, or the full-blown lotus.Thrice-blessed they who with delighted hearts, shall beholdRāma returned from the forest and come back to Ayodhyā,like unto Sukra crowning the zenith? O Kauçalyā, my heartis weighed down with grief; and I do not perceive objectsof hearing, feeling, or taste. My senses are growing dim inconsequence of the mental stupor, like the rays of a lampreduced to smoke, becoming dim when the oil has beenexhausted. As the violence of a river wears away its banks.my grief occasioned through my own agency is destroying me,who am helpless and insensible. O mighty-armed Rāghava!O thou remover of my troubles! O thou that dost delightin thy father! thou art my stay, O my son, that hast goneaway. O Kauçalyā, I do not see. O wretched Sumitrā! Ocruel one, thou enemy of mine, thou Kaikeyi, who hastbefouled thy line!\" Having thus lamented in presence of Rāma'smother and Sumitrā, king Daçaratha breathed his last."

Filled with doubtsat sight of the king, the ladies at last concluded that whathad been apprehended (by the monarch) had certainly takenplace. Overcome by grief for their sons, Sumitrā andKauçalyā were sleeping as if they were dead, and hadnot yet awaked. Deprived of lustre, pallid, stricken bysorrow, and lying with her limbs contracted, Kauçalyā lookedlike a star enveloped in darkness. And after Kauçalyā, theking, and after him, Sumitrā; and with her countenancefaded from grief, this noble lady did not look particularlylovely. Finding these two ladies asleep and the kingseeming as if sleeping, the inmates of the inner apartmentshowed themselves as if their lives had departed out ofthem. Thereupon exceedingly distressed, those paragonsof their sex, like she-elephants in the forest deprived of theirleader of the herd, broke out into wailing. At the soundsof their lamentations, bpth Kauçalyā and Sumitrā suddenlyregaining consciousness, awoke from their sleep.

And whenthe king had departed this life, the women saw Kauçalyāfallen on the earth like the slain mate of an elephant. Thenall the wives of the monarch headed by Kaikeyi, burningwith grief and weeping, were well nigh rendered senseless.And the loud sounds emitted by these, mingling with those(who had been lamenting before them), attained greaterproportions and filled the hall. And the mansion of the kingbecame filled with people exceedingly excited andfrightened, eager to know all about the matter,—became filled withlamentations, with friends afflicted with distress, its joyinstantaneously vanished—a scene of distress and dole.Knowing that the lord of earth had departed, his wivessurrounding that illustrious one, smitten with excess of sorrowand weeping bitterly and piteously, holding the king's handsindulged in lamentations, like forlorn ones."

O cruel one, O thouof wicked ways, thou that forsaking the king had set thyheart (on having thy son crowned), Rāma had gone away,forsaking me; and now my lord has ascended heaven.

What other woman except Kaikeyi lostto righteousness, having lost her deity, her lord, wishesto carry on existence in another's kingdom? As a covetuousperson taking poison (through anger or some other passion),does not consider himself guilty, (so Kaikeyi) having donethis evil through Mantharā's incitement, does not bring herguilt home to her mind. It is through the instrumentality ofthe hump-backed woman that this race of the Rāghavas hasbeen destroyed by Kaikeyi. Hearing that the king beingmade to do an unrighteous action, has banished Rāmatogether with his wife, king Janaka will be filled with griefas I have been.

She that hasrenounced the king, Rāma, and Lakshmana along with Sitā—whom can such a one not renounce?\" Thus with tears intheir eyes, the wives of that descendant of Raghu, joylessand convulsed with a huge passion, displayed signs of sorrow.Like a night without stars, like a fair one forsaken by herhusband, the city of Ayodhyā without the magnanimousmonarch did not appear delightful as it had done before,with the populace filled with tears, the ladies utteringexclamations of distress, and the terraces and courts deserted.On the lord of men having ascended heaven from grief, andthe wives of the king remaining on the earth, the sun, hisjourney done, set, and the night began her course. Theidea of consuming the king's corpse in the absence of hisson did not recommend itself to the assembled adherents (ofthe departed). Thinking this, they in that way laid theking endowed with an inconceivably dignified presence. Andwith her terraces overflowing with tears that flooded thethroats of the mourners, the city appeared like the welkinwithout its splendour in the absence of the sun, or the nightwith the stars enveloped. And on the demise of thatillustrious personage, in the city men and women in multitudes,censuring Bharata's mother, became extremely distressed,and did not attain peace of mind."

Then facingthe royal priest, the eminent Vasistha, they said, \"That nightthat had appeared like unto an hundred years has at last beenpainfully passed. The king racked by sorrow for his son hasbreathed his last, the mighty monarch has ascended heaven,Rāma has taken refuge in the woods, the energetic Lakshmanahas gone with Rāma, and both Bharata and Satrugna—repressors of foes—are staying in Kekaya in pleasantRajagriha, the abode of their maternal grandfather. Do you selectsome one this very day from the descendants of Ikshwāku,be king here. Verily doth a kingdom go to ruin, when withouta king. He that goes garlanded with lightning, and has amighty voice, even the cloud—doth not with skyey showerdrench the Earth in a kingdom without a king. In a kinglesskingdom no one sows corn. In a kingless kingdom the son doesnot obey his sire, or the wife her husband. A kingless kingdompossesses no wealth, and wives are hard to keep in such aplace. This great fear attends a kingless country. Andwhere is other morality (besides that detailed above) to befound at such a place? In a kingless country men do notform themselves into associations, nor do they, inspired withcheerfulness, make elegant gardens or sacred edifices. In akingless country, the twice-born ones do not celebratesacrifices. In a kingless country, in mighty sacrifices wealthyBrāhmanas do not confer (on the officiating priests) thedakshinās (which they receive according to the ordinance),In a kingless country, neither social gatherings, nor festivitiescharacterised by the presence of merry theatrical managersand performers, increase. In a kingless country disputantscannot decide their point; nor are persons given to hearingPurānic recitations pleased by those delighting in thepractice. In a kingless country, bevies of virgins decked ingold do not repair to gardens for purposes of sport. In akingless country, the wealthy are not well protected; nor doshepherds and cultivators sleep with their doors open. In akingless country pleasure-seeking people do not in companywith females go to the woods by means of swift vehicles,In a kingless country long-tusked elephants sixty yearsold, bearing bells on their necks, do not walk thehighway. In a kingless country one hears not the clappingsof persons engaged in shooting arrows constantly. Ina kingless country traders coming from distant lands,loaded with various kinds of merchandise, do not withsafety go along the roads. In a kingless country the asceticwith his subdued senses, himself his sole protector, whomakes his quarters wherever evening overtakes him, cannotwalk contemplating the Deity. In a kingless country, onecannot protect what one has, or procure what one has not.In a kingless country, the forces cannot bear the onslaughtof the foe. In a kingless country men cannot at willgo on excellent and high-mettled horses and ornamentedcars. In a kingless country persons well versed in learningcan not engage in controversy, repairing to woods and groves.In a kingless country, persons with intent hearts do notoffer garlands, sweets, and dakshinās, for worshipping thegods. In a kingless country, princes smeared with sandaland aguru, do not look graceful like trees in spring. Even asa river without water, a wood without grass, a herd of kinewithout a keeper, is a kingdom without a king. The signof a car is its pennon, of fire is smoke, and our bannerthe king, has gone to heaven. In a kingless country aperson hardly preserves his life; and like fishes people eatup one another. Even those heretics who having disregardedthe dignity of social morality had met with chastisement atthe hands of the king, their fear removed—give themselvesairs. As the sight is engaged in the welfare of the body,the king—that fountain of truth and religion—is engagedin compassing the good of the kingdom. The king is truth,the king is morality, the king is the racial dignity of thosepossessed of the same, the king is the father, the king is themother—the king compasseth the welfare of men. By virtueof magnanimity of character, a king surpasses Yama andVaiçravana and Sakra and Varuna endowed with mighty strength.If there were not a king in this world to adjudge fairand foul, darkness would overspread (the face of the earth)and people could not distinguish anything whatever. As theocean keepeth within its continent, we even while themonarch lived, did not disregard your words. Do you, Obest of Brāhmanas, beholding our acts rendered nugatory,and this empire become a wilderness for want of a king,install that descendant of Ikshwāku or any other as king ofthis realm.\""

In a dream I beheld my father, pale, with his hair looselyflowing about, plunging from the summit of a mountaininto a dirty pool filled with cow-dung. And I saw himfloating on a sink of cow-dung, and yet with a momentarylaugh drinking oil by means of his joined hands. Thenfeeding on rice mixed with sessame, he again and againhanging his head down, dives into oil with his limbs rubbedwith oil. And in my dream I saw the ocean dried up, andthe moon fallen on the earth, and the earth as if invadedby enfolding darkness, and the tusk of the elephant on whichthe monarch rides falling in fragments, and flaming firesuddenly extinguished, and the earth rent, and the treeswithered, and all the mountains befching smoke. . AndI saw the king seated on a sable seat of iron, clad in a sablegarb; and women black and yellow beating him. Andbearing a garland of red flowers, with his body daubed withred sandal, he was fast proceeding to the south in a caryoked with asses. And women clad in red garment werelaughing at him, and a grim-visaged Rākshasa was seen byme as dragging him. This was the dream that I saw thisterrible night.

ThenDaçarātha's son went to the beautiful village of Varutha.Having for a while stayed at that romantic wood, heproceeded eastwards, and presented himself at the villa ofUjjihāyana, where abound trees (called) Priyaka. Coming tothe Priyakas, Bharata speedily yoking the horses, set outwithout delay, issuing his orders to the forces. Thensojourning at Sarvatirtha and crossing the river there flowingnorthwards as well as others abounding in various kinds ofmountainous horses, Bharata arrived at Hastiprishthaka.And at Lohitya that foremost of men crossed the Kapivati,at Ekasala, the Sthānumati, and at Vinaya, the Gomati. AndBharata arriving at a forest of Sala trees in the city ofKalinga, speedily passed it with his forces way-worn. Andhaving passed the forest swiftly over night, he at sunrisesaw Ayodhyā built by king Manu. Having spent sevennights on the journey, that chief of men beheld Ayodhyābefore him and thus addressed the charioteer, \"O charioteer,from the distance Ayodhyā seemeth like a mass of blackearth, albeit she boasts of sacrificial priests crowned with everyvirtue, Brāhmanas versed in the Vedas and opulent people,and albeit she is maintained by Rājarshis. Formerly one couldhear a great and mighty tumult all round Ayodhyā proceedingfrom men and women; but I do not hear this to-day. Thegardens wherefrom persons having sported in the eveningused to rush out (at day break) wear a different aspect now.Forsaken by the pleasure-seekers, the gardens appear toweep. And, O charioteer, the city appears to me like awilderness. And I do not as formerly behold the flower ofthe city leaving or entering her on cars or elephants orhorses. Gardens which, frequented by people inebriatedwith the honey of love, met together for purposes of sport,looked charmingly blooming, I find as utterly void ofcheerfulness, with the trees as if lamenting with tremulous leaves.Still do I not hear the inarticulate though sweet and deliciousvoice of beasts and birds crying in chorus.160 Why, as before,doth not the blameless161 and bland wind blow mixed with (theperfume of sandal and faint with dhupa? And why, again,have the sounds of Vinas and Mridangas developed by beatingsticks, which continually flew in a never-ceasing vigorouscourse, ceased to-day? And I witness various evil, unsightly,and unpleasant162 omens, and hence my mind is depressed. Ocharioteer, complete good fortune with my friends is hardlyto be realised. Bui although no apparent cause exists formy depression of spirits, yet my heart droopeth.\" ThenBharata depressed and cast down and with his senses afflicted,speedily entered the city ruled by Ikshwāku. And Bharatahaving his vehicles fatigued, entered by the Vaijayanta163 gate,and went on, followed by the gate-keepers, who enquiredafter his welfare. Then courteously telling the warders todesist, he with an agitated heart spoke unto the tiredcharioteer of Açwapati, \"0 sinless one, why have I been broughtin this haste without any (adequate) reason? My heartapprehendeth some evil; and my disposition gives way. Ocharioteer, I see around me all those signs which I had heardtold as occurring on the occasion of the deaths of monarchs.I behold the houses of the citizens unswept and unsightlywith the doors flung open,—and destitute of grace, withoutsacrifices and other religious ceremonies, without the incenseof dhupa, the citizens fasting, and the people appearingwith faded countenances, displaying no flags, etc. The abodesof the deities are not decorated with garlands, and theircourts are unclean; and remaining vacant, they look no longerbeautiful as formerly. And the images are not worshipped;and the places of sacrifice are in a like condition. Andgarlands are not displayed in the shops where they are sold.And traders looking anxious, with their business stopped,do not look as before. And in temples and Chaityas birdsand beasts appear dispirited. And in the city I behold menand women pale and woe-begone and emaciated and anxious,with tears filling their eyes.\" Having said this unto thecharioteer, Bharata, beholding these inauspicious sights,entered the palace of the king with a depressed heart.Beholding the city resembling the city of Indra, with hercrossings and houses and roads void of people, and thedoors and hinges covered with dust, Bharata was filled withgreater grief. And witnessing many unpleasant thingswhich he had never seen during the life of the monarch, thathigh-souled one entered the mansion of his father, bendinghis head, depressed in spirits, and with his mind extremelyaggrieved."

Onseeing her son before her after his sojourn from home,Kaikeyi delighted, rose up from her golden seat. On enteringhis own quarter which he found deprived of grace, thevirtuous Bharata took hold of his mother's auspicious feet. Thensmelling the crown of his head and embracing him and takingthat illustrious one on her lap, Kaikeyi addressed him,saying, \"How many days hence did you leave the residenceof the revered one? Hast thou felt any fatigue on the wayincident to the car proceeding swiftly? And is the reveredone well, and thy maternal uncle, Yudhājit? And, my son,hast thou passed thy time pleasantly during thy sojourn?It behoves thee to tell me all this.\" Thus asked, that sonof the king, Bharata, furnished with eyes resembling lotusestold his mother that all was well. \"Seven nights hence Itook leave of that revered one's residence. My mother'ssire is well, as also my maternal uncle, Yudhājit. My vehicleshad got tired in consequence of bearing the wealth andjewels which that subduer of foes, the king, had bestowed onme. And it is for this reason that I have come in advanceof them. Urged by the royal emissaries, I have come hereso swiftly. But it behoves my mother to tell me what Iwish to ask. This sleeping bedstead of yours adorned withgold is empty. I do not see the race of Ikshwāku in theirusual good spirits. The king generally remains in thisapartment of my mother. But coming here with the desire ofseeing him, I do not today find him at this place. I wouldtake the feet of my father. Do you tell me who ask you.Is he in the apartment of my eldest mother, Kauçalyā?\"Blinded by the lust of dominion, and looking upon that asdesirable (unto Bharata) which was exceedingly disagreeable(to him), Kaikeyi replied unto him, who did not know whathad transpired, \"That high-souled and energetic one everengaged in sacrifice—the refuge of the good—thy father, theking, has come by the state which pertains to all creatures.\"Hearing these words, Bharata of pure ways sprung from arighteous race, smit with the vehemence of sorrow on accountof his father, suddenly fell down to the earth. And exclaimingin the anguish of spirit and in the excess of grief, the words,\"Ah me! I am undone!\" that mighty-armed one endowed withprowess, fell down, tossing about his arms. Then,overwhelmed with sorrow and distressed at the death of his father,that highly energetic one, with his senses distracted, indulgedin lamentations, \"This bed of my father used to look likethe speckless welkin at night crowned with the moon, afterthe clouds have gone off. But to-day, deprived of thatintelligent one, it ceases to shine, like the firmament withoutthe moon or the sea devoid of its waters.\" Exclaimingwith tears trickling down, that foremost of victorious ones,extremely afflicted at heart, wept, muffling his gracefulcountenance. Seeing that one resembling a celestial fallento the earth, striken with sorrow, like unto a bough of theSāla that had been severed in the wood by an axe, hismother raising up his distressed son like a mad elephant orthe sun or the moon, addressed him, \"Arise, arise. Why dostthou lie down, O illustrious son of the king? Persons likethee having their senses under perfect control, and approvedby men of culture, do not grieve. O thou endowed withunderstanding, like the halo of the Sun in the solar disc,thy sense, entitled to dispensing gifts and celebratingsacrifices, ever follows morals, the Sruti, and asceticism.\""

But it has fallen out otherwise. That I do not beholdmy father ever engaged in the dear welfare (of his subjects)cleaves my heart, mother. Of what ailment hath the kingbreathed his last during my absence? Blessed are Rāmaand others who have personally performed my sire's last rites.Surely the renowned monarch doth not know that I havecome. (If he had done so), pressing down my head, myfather would at once have smelt it. Where is now thesoft hand of that energetic one which used to rub my personwhen it was covered with dust? Do you now withoutdelay convey the news of my arrival unto the vigorousRāma, who is at once my father, brother and friend, andwhose beloved servant I am. The eldest brother of one thatis noble and cognisant of morality, becomes his father.I shall take hold of his feet: he is now my refuge. And,noble lady, what did that virtuous one cognizant of virtue,that pre-eminently pious one, firm in his vow, and havingtruth for prowess—even my father, say? I wish to hear newsconcerning us relative to the last moments of the monarch.\"Thus asked, Kaikeyi related all as it had happened, saying,\"Bewailing 'Ah Rāma!' 'Ah Sitā!' 'Ah Lakshmana!' thatmagnanimous one, the foremost of those that have attainedto excellent state (after death), has gone to the next worldcoming under the law of time. Thy father like a mightyelephant fast bound with a cord, said unto me these wordsduring his last moments,—'Blessed are they that shall seeRāma and the mighty-armed Lakshmana returned along withSitā.'\" Hearing this, Bharata apprehending a secondmisfortune was deeply moved; and with a sad countenance, heagain asked his mother, \"Where hath gone that righteous*souled one, the enhancer of Kauçalyā's joy, along withLakshmana and Sitā?\" Thus questioned, his mother at thesame time duly said in words. which although highlyunwelcome, she took as agreeable to Bharata, \"O son, that son of theking wearing bark has repaired to the forest of Dandaka,along with Vaidehi and followed by Lakshmana.\"Hearing this, Bharata apprehending some moral lapse on thepart of his brother from the dignity of his race, asked inagitation, \"Has Rāma deprived any Brāhmana of his wealth?Or has he wronged any innocent person, whether rich orpoor? Has the fancy of the prince gone after the wife ofanother? For what reason hath brother Rāma beenbanished?\" Thereat his volatile mother, influenced by herfeminine nature, related faithfully unto him her own doings,Thus asked by the magnanimous Bharata, Kaikeyi vainlyturning herself on her wisdom, joyfully said, \"Rāmahas deprived no Brāhmana of his property, nor hath anyinnocent person rich or otherwise been wronged by him,—nor doth he ever with his eyes look at the wife of another.O son, as soon as I heard of Rāma's (coming)installation, I asked for the kingdom to be conferred on thee,and Rāma to be banished. Thereupon, he, staying by hispromise, did accordingly: Rāma hath been banished alongwith Sumitrā's son and Sitā.' Not seeing his beloved son,the illustrious lord of earth, stricken by grief on his account,has breathed his last. Do thou now, O thou cognizant ofduty, take charge of the kingdom. I have done all this inthy interests. Do not give way to sorrow. O son, assumepatience. This city is subject to thee, as well as thispeaceful kingdom. Having with the help of the principalBrāhmanas headed by Vasishtha, duly performed the funeralobsequies of the king, do thou, without suffering thy energyto depart, install thyself in the kingdom.\""

Thou, like one throwing alkali on a sore, hast,by bringing about the death of the king and making Rāmaan ascetic, heaped grief on grief. Thou hast come likethe fatal night for the destruction of this race. Notunderstanding it, my father embraced live coal. O thou that hastthy gaze fixed on sin, it is through thee that my sovereignhas come by death; and that, O stainer of the line, this racehas by thy infatuation been deprived of its happiness.Having got thee, my illustrious sire intent upon truth, kingDaçarātha, afflicted by extreme sorrow, has departed thislife. Why hath the king, my father, ever loving virtue, beendeprived of life? Why hath Rāma been banished; andwherefore hath he gone to the woods? Afflicted with grieffor their son, even if Kauçalyā and Sumitrā live, it will behard for them to do so in the presence of thee, my mother.Surely the noble and virtuous Rāma, well knowing his dutiestowards his superiors, regards thee as highly as he doth hisown mother. In the same way, my eldest mother, thefar-sighted Kauçalyā, doing her duties by thee, bearsherself like a sister. Why, O sinful one, having sentto the woods her magnanimous son, clad in bark, dostthou not grieve? Having exiled the famous and heroicRāma seeing no sin, clad in bark, what benefit dostthou perceive as thine? I deem that thou didst not knowhow very highly I regarded Rāghava; and therefore it isthat thou hast brought this mighty calamity. Not seeingthose chiefs of men, Rāma and Lakshmana, by virtue ofwhose energy can I venture to rule the kingdom? Themonarch was ever protected by that powerful one possessedof mighty energy, as Meru is protected by its forest. Like acalf burdened with a load capable of being borne by amighty ox, by what energy shall I bear this burthen which wasborne by an exceedingly strong person? And even if thisstrength be mine through yoga or vigor of intellect, I willnot crown with success the hopes of thee, proud of thy son.Nor, had Rāma not always regarded thee as his mother,would I hesitate to renounce thee, whose heart hath beenset on sin. O thou that viewest unrighteousness, O thouwho hast fallen off from the way of the good, how couldsuch thoughts unworthy of our line, arise in thy mind? Inthis race, the eldest brother of all is installed in the kingdom:the other brothers remain under him. O fell one, thou dostnot, I think, know the morality of kings, or the consequencethat attends its faithful observance. Of all the princes, theeldest is always installed as the king. Even this is theaccepted principle of all sovereigns—specially the descendants ofIkswāku. But to-day the pride of character of those whosevirtue was their sole concern,165 and who shone in thecharacter of their line, has been humbled through thyinstrumentality. And how, O highly exalted lady, O thou thatwast born in a royal race, could such reprehensible fatuity takepossession of thy senses? But, O thou bent upon sin, I willby no means fulfil the wish of thee by whom hath beenbrought in the first instance this calamity calculated to endmy existence. Further, O sinless one, I will do this at presentto displease thee: I will bring from the forest my brotherdear unto his relatives. And having brought back Rāma,I will in a perfectly contented spirit, become the slave ofthat one of flaming energy.\" The high-souled Bharata afflicted(his mother) with multitudes of words causing pain; anddistressed with grief, emitted sounds like unto a lion in thecave of Mandara."

Having been lost to righteousness,do not thou lament me dead. What qualities of thine weretaxed by the king or the exceedingly virtuous Rāma, thatboth of them simultaneously have come by death and exilerespectively through thy agency? O Kaikeyi, thou hast beenguilty of homicide in consequence of the destruction of thisrace. Do thou go to hell, never to the world attained by myfather; since, renouncing Rāma dear unto all, thou hastcommitted this sin by thy grim act and brought me intofear. Through thee hath my father met with his end, andRāma hath taken refuge in the woods; and it is throughthee that I have come to ignominy among all creatures. O thouenemy of mine in the guise of a mother! O fell one! O thouthat covetest the kingdom! do thou not speak to me, Owicked wretch! O slayer of thy husband! it is because ofthee, stainer of thy race, that Kauçalyā, Sumitrā, and othermothers of mine have been overwhelmed with a mightysorrow. Thou art never the daughter of the pious andintelligent Açwapati, thou art a Rākshasi born in that race,thou that hast destroyed my father's race, inasmuch as thevirtuous and heroic Rāma ever observing truth hath been sentto the woods and my father hath ascended heaven throughthy agency; inasmuch as thou that hast perpetrated thisarch offence, hast laid this sin on me, who have beenforsaken by my sire, renounced by my brothers, and comeby universal disfavor. O thou of sinful ways, havingseparated the virtuous Kauçalyā (from her son), what world, Othou that repairest to hell, shall be thy portion? Dost thounot, O tortuous one, know that that one sprung fromKauçalyā's, self, my eldest brother Rāma, who is like afather unto me, has ever been the refuge of his friends? Ason born from all the limbs of his mother, comes out fromher heart; and therefore it is that he is far dearer unto hismother, albeit her friends are dear to her.166 Once on a time, itis related by persons cognizant of morality, Surabhi regardedby the celestials, beheld two of her sons toiling on earth andseeming to be deprived of their senses. And, when the dayhad been half spent, seeing her sons fatigued on earth, shestricken with grief for them, began to weep with tearsflooding her eyes. And it came to pass that as themagnanimous sovereign of the celestials was passing below, her fineand fragrant tear-drops fell on his person. Turning his eyesup, Sakra found Surabhi stationed in the sky, distressed andweeping in extreme anguish of spirit. Seeing that illustriousone burning in grief, the wielder of the thunder-bolt, Indrathe lord of the celestials, waxing anxious, with joined handssaid, 'Is there any great danger in any quarter? Do thou,O thou that art intent on the welfare of all, say, whence isthis grief of thine?' Thus addressed by the intelligent king ofthe celestials, that one well skilled in speech, the sedate Surabhianswered, 'Auspiciousness, O lord of celestials! No sin isyours. But I mourn my sons fallen into evil plight, havingseen them lean, distressed, and burnt by the rays of the sun—Valivarddhas afflicted by the wicked-minded ploughman.Seeing those that have been born of my body, cast down andin trouble, I grieve: there is none that is dear like unto a son.'Seeing her the whole earth is filled with whose sons bythousands, weeping, Indra understood that none is an object ofgreater affection than a son. And that lord, Indra, alsoconsidered Surabhi of a person breathing a sacred odour, whosetears had dropped on his body, as the foremost being onearth. Even that one yeilding whatever is asked, auspicious,crowned with the choicest virtues, although having all naturalfunctions, showing equal kindness unto all, and of unequalledcharacter, who maintaineth all creatures, she who hath athousand sons, grieves (for her sons). How can then Kauçalyācarry on existence without Rāma? Chaste and having an onlyson, that lady has through thee been separated from her son,(like a cow separated from her calf). For this, thou wilt alwayshave to suffer misery alike in this world and the next I shallfor my part completely minister unto my brother and father;and shall, without doubt, increase my fame. Bringing hitherthe mighty-armed lord of Koçala endowed with immensestrength, I myself will repair to the forest inhabited byascetics. O thou that hast delivered thyself over to iniquity! I,looked at by the citizens with their throats oppressed withthe vapour of grief, cannot bear this (burden of) sin heapedon me by thee. Do thou enter fire, or dive intoDandaka, or wound a cord round thy neck: other desirable waythere is none for thee. On Rāma having truth for prowess,obtaining the earth, I, my disgrace removed, shall be blest.\"Grieving thus, Bharata, like an elephant in the forest afflictedwith a tomara or ankusa,167 fell to the earth sighing like anenraged snake. With his eyes reddened, and his clothfalling off, and his ornaments cast away, that subduer offoes, the king's son fallen on the earth, resembled a bannerof Sakra after the festival is over."

I had never consulted my mother. Nor did I knowthe installation that had been thought of by the monarch. Iwas then living in a far country in company with Satrughna.I did not know the banishment of the magnanimous Rāma tothe woods, or the exile of Sumitrā's son; nor did I know howSitā came to be banished.\" As the high-souled Bharata wasthus wailing, Kauçalyā recognizing his voice spoke untoSumitrā, \"Come is Bharata, the son of that one of crookedways. I am desirous of seeing the far-sighted Bharata.\"Having said this unto Sumitrā, that one emaciated and witha pallid countenance, trembling and almost deprived ofsensation, went to where Bharata was. And it came to pass thatthe king's son, Bharata, along with Satrughna had just thenby the way that led to the same, been proceeding toKauçalyā's quarter. Then Satrughna and Bharata seeingthe aggrieved Kauçalyā, embraced the stricken and fallenlady well nigh deprived of her senses. Thereupon,weeping from grief, the noble and intelligent Kauçalyā exceedinglyafflicted, embracing them as they indulged in sorrow,said unto Bharata, \"Thus hast thou, that hadst desired thekingdom, received it rid of its thorn. Alas! it has beenspeedily obtained through the crooked act of Kaikeyi. Whatis the good that is perceived by Kaikeyi of tortuous sightin sending away my son clad in bark to the woods? Itbehoveth Kaikeyi to send me also speedily to where isstaying my illustrious son furnished with a gold-gleaming navel.Or first performing the fire-sacrifice, I followed by Sumitrā,will myself happily seek the way by which Rāghava (hasgone to the woods). Or it behoveth thee to thyself bringme unto the place where that foremost of men, my son, isperforming austerities. This spacious kingdom aboundingin corn and wealth, and filled with elephants, horses, andcars, is thine, having been conferred on thee (by Kaikeyi).\"Thus reproached by many a harsh word, the sinless Bharatafelt exceeding pain like unto that produced by prickinga sore with a needle. Exceedingly agitated, he fell atKauçalyā's feet, lamenting much, and well nigh deprived ofhis senses. Bharata then regained his consciousness, andwith joined hands answered Kauçalyā lamenting thus andovercome with excess of sorrow, saying,—\"O noble lady,what for dost thou censure me who am without sin and whoknow nothing of this?

Lucky it is thatgraced with auspicious marks, thou swervest not fromvirtue. My child, for this reason thou wilt attain theregions of pious persons. Saying this, Kauçalyāoverpowered with emotion, drawing into her lap Bharata attachedto his brother, and embracing the mighty armed one, gaveway to grief. And bewailing thus, the mind of the highsouled (Bharata) wrought with sorrow, was overcome withthe burden of grief. And fallen on the ground, lamenting,senseless, with his intellect overpowered, and momentarilyheaving sighs, Bharata passed away night in grief."

  "Bālakāndam and Ayodhyākāndam": "As Bharata, the son of Kaikeyi was thus burning in grief,that foremost of those skilled in speech, the saint Vasishtha,endowed with excellence of language, said, \"Do not weep,good betide thee, O illustrious prince. Do thou perform thefunereal rites of the departed king.\" Hearing Vasishtha'swords, Bharata cognisant of duty, bowed down to the groundand despatched the ministers for performing the last rites.And raising from under the oil the body of the king with asallow countenance, and appearing to be asleep, Bharataplaced it on the ground upon a couch in front adorned withvarious gems. Then overwhelmed with grief, Daçarātha'sson bewailed him thus, \"O king, what was it that thou hadstintended to do, I absent and away from home, by banishingrighteous Rāma and the powerful Lakshmana? Whitherwendest thou, O mighty monarch, forsaking these aggrievedpeople, who have already been deprived of the lion likeRāma energetic in action? O father, thou having ascendedheaven and Rāma having taken refuge in the woods, whonow in this city of thine shall protect what the people possessand secure unto them what they have not? Widowed inconsequence of losing thee, this earth does not look graceful.The city appeareth unto me like the night deprived of theMoon.\" As Bharata was lamenting thus in dejected mood,the mighty ascetic Vasishtha again addressed him, saying, \"Omighty armed one, do thou without indulging in anyreflections, perform those funeral ceremonies of the monarchwhich ought to be performed.\" Thereupon honoring hiswords by saying, \"So be it,\" he urged speed upon all theRitwigas, priests, and Achāryas. And then those thathad brought the king's corpse outside from the fire chamber,instructed by the Ritwigas and priests according to theordinance began to offer oblations into the fire. Next placingthe king deprived of life on a car, the servants with theirthroats oppressed with vapour and with their minds weigheddown with dejection carried him. And scattering gold andsilver and various kinds of cloth, on the way, people went infront of the king. Others procuring sandal, aguru and otherresinous incenses, sarala, padmaka and devaduru, cast it(on the earth). And drawing near the king there, Ritwigaslaid various other fragrant substances on the funeral pile.Then offering oblations into the fire, the Ritwigas beganto recite japa; and as laid down in the scriptures, Sāmasingers chanted Sāmas. And by means of litters and otherconveyances, each mounted according to her rank, thewives of the king went out from the city, surroundedby aged men. And Ritwijas went round the corpse ofthe king who performed many sacrifices leaving it onthe left side. And kindling with grief, the females alsoheaded by Kauçalyā, (circumambulated the pyre). Andthen there was heard the wail of women distressedwith grief weeping piteously by thousands like untoKraunchis. Weeping again and again with their sense lost,the wives of the king alighted from the car on the banks ofthe Sarayu. Having performed the watery rites, the wivesof the monarch as well as the counsellors and priests, incompany with Bharata entering the city with tears in theireyes, spent ten days168 in mourning lying down on theground."

  "Bālakāndam and Ayodhyākāndam": "When the ten days had gone by, the king's son, hisuncleanness (consequent on the demise of his father)removed, performed the srāddha on the twelfth day. Onthe occasion of the ceremonies for the welfare of the departedspirit, the son of the king conferred on Brāhmanas wealthand gems, and rice in abudance, and herds of goats, andsilver in profusion, and countless kine, and maid-servants andman-servants, and vehicles and spacious mansions. And onthe thirteenth day, the long armed Bharata, overwhelmed withgrief, burst into lamentation. And coming to the foot of thefuneral pyre for gathering the bones of the departed, heovercome with grief, with his throat obstructed with thesounds of lamentation, said, \"my father, on brother Rāma,to whom I had been consigned by thee, having gone to theforest, I have been cast by thee into vacancy. My father,forsaking forlorn mother Kauçalyā, whose stay her son,had gone to the forest, where hast thou gone, O king?\"And seeing the spot where lay the bones of his father mixedwith ashes and embers, Bharata looking at the place whereoccurred the dissolution of his father's frame, carried away byemotion, indulged in sorrow. And seeing this, heexceedingly distressed, crying fell down to the ground. And raisedup (by others) he looked like an uplifted banner of Sakrabound to an engine. And his counsellors rushed towardsthat one of pure vows, like the saints making towards Jayatias he was falling on the extinction of his merit. SeeingBharata plunged in grief, Satrughna remembering the king,fell down to the ground deprived of consciousness. Anddevoid of sense and like a madman, he in grief of heartbegan to lament remembering all the virtues of his father againand again. \"This terrible sea of grief owing its origin toMantharā, containing its ferocious aquatic animal in theshape of Kaikeyi, and incapable of being disturbed inconsequence of the bestowal of the boon drowns (us). Ofather, where hast thou gone, leaving the tender andyouthful Bharata fondled by thee, to lament (thy loss). Thou didstuse to confer on us eatables and drinkables and attires andornaments. Who will now do so? Deprived of thee, thehigh souled king cognisant of duty, the earth albeit her timeof riving is come, is not yet riven. My father having goneto heaven and Rāma having sought the woods, how can Ilive? I will enter fire. Bereft of my brother and sire, Iwill not enter the empty Ayodhyā governed by the Ikshwākus.I will repair to the forest of asceticism.\" Hearing hislamentations and seeing that disaster, all the followersbecame all the more distressed. Then depressed andexhausted, both Satrughna and Bharata rolled on the earth like twobulls with their horns fractured. Then the all-knowingpriest of their father possessed of sterling worth, Vasishtha,raising Bharata, said unto him, \"O Lord this is the thirteenthday since the cremation of thy sire. Why dost thou delay,when thou hast to collect the bones? Three couples169 pertainin especial to all creatures and these being inevitable, thouought not to bear yourself thus. And Sumantra also versedin the nature of things, raising up Satrughna and pacifyinghim, discoursed the birth and death of all beings. Beingraised up, those renowned chiefs of men looked like Indra'sbanner stained by shine and shower. And as the princesstood there shedding tears, with reddened eyes, andspeaking sadly, the courtiers urged them on in behalf of the ritesthat remained."

  "Bālakāndam and Ayodhyākāndam": "Then Satrughna, the younger brother of Lakshmanaspoke unto Bharata burning in grief as he was revolving inhis mind the (intended) journey (to Rāma), \"Need it be saidthat Rāma is the refuge both of himself and all creatures introuble? That Rāma possessed of strength hath been exiledinto the woods by a woman! And powerful and havingprowess, why did not Lakshmana deliver Rāma by checkingour father? The king bent upon following an unrighteouscourse through the influence of a woman, should, the justiceor otherwise of the measure being fully weighed, at the veryoutset have been checked.\" As Lakshmana's younger brotherSatrughna was speaking thus, appeared there at the door infront the hump-backed one adorned with every kind ofornament, with her body besmeared with sandal paste,wearing regal apparel, and variously decked out with avariety of ornaments. And adorned with elegant cones,and divers other superb ornaments, she looked like a femalemonkey tethered with a rope. At that time seeing thatone of horrible misdeeds, (Bharata) who stood near thedoor, seizing the hump backed one ruthlessly, took her untoSatrughna, and said, \"That one through whom Rāma hasgone to the wood and our father has renounced his bodythis is that wicked and remorseless one. Do thou deal withher as thou likest.\" At Bharata's command Satrughnaobserving vows waxing exceedingly aggrieved, addressedall the inmates of the inner apartment, saying, \"This onehas occasioned intense misery unto my father and brothers.Let her now take the fruit of her fell deed.\" Having saidthis, he furiously fell upon the hump backed one surroundedby her maids. Thereupon she with her cries made thechamber resound. Concluding Satrughna fired with rage,her associates extremely pained, fled away in all directions.Then her companions in a body took counsel of each other,saying, \"considering the way in which he has entered uponit, he will annihilate us quite. Let us therefore seek theprotection of the tender hearted generous, pious and illustriousKauçalyā. Even she is our sure refuge. Overpoweredwith rage, that chastiser of foes, Satrughna, dragged theshrieking hump-backed one to the ground. As Mantharāwas pushed this way and that, her various ornaments werescattered over the floor. Aad strewn with those ornaments,the graceful chamber of the palace looked like the autumnalfirmament. And that foremost of men possessed of strengthholding her, began to reprove Kaikeyi with harsh speech.Extremely hurt by those rough words, Kaikeyi terrified onaccount of Satrughna, took refuge with her son. Thereuponcasting his eyes on Satrughna, Bharata said, \"A woman isincapable of being slain by any. Do thou therefore excuseher. I myself would have slain this wicked Kaikeyi of impiousdeeds, if the righteous Rāma should not be displeased withme on account of my slaying my mother. And if Rāghavaknows that the hump-backed one hath been slain, he surelywill speak neither with thee nor me.\" Hearing Bharata'swords, Satrughna, younger brother unto Lakshmana, refrainedfrom that wrong and set free the hump-backed woman in aswoon. Thereat, sighing hard in exceeding grief, Mantharāflung herself at Kaikeyi's feet, weeping piteously. Seeingthe hump-backed one deprived of her senses in consequenceof the pushing she had received at the hands of Satrughna,Bhjarata's mother consoled that distressed woman, whoappeared like a Kraunchi that had been entrapped."

Do thou, therefore, Oillustrious prince, become our king. Having been permitted bythe king, thou wilt commit no fault (by doing so), as thiskingdom is without a master. O Rāghava, having procuredall these necessaries for the installation, the counsellors andothers as well as the citizens wait, O king's son. Do thou,O Bharata, take charge of this secure kingdom bequeathedby thy father and grandfather. Do thou, O foremost of men,have thyself sprinkled, and rule over us.\" Thereupon,having gone round all the things procured for the sprinklingBharata firm in his vows addressed those persons, saying,\"In our line it is ever fit for the first-born alone to performthe task of government. It doth not behove ye who arewise to say so unto me. Certainly Rāma our eldest brothershall become the king; and I will abide in the forest forfive and nine years. Do ye array the grand and mightyarmy consisting of fourfold forces. I will bring back fromthe forest my eldest brother Rāghava. And taking all thesenecessaries for the investiture in front, I will go in thedirection of the forest for Rāma. And sprinkling that chiefof men on the spot, I will placing him in our front, bringRāma back, like unto fire brought in from the sacrifice. Iwill never fulfil the desire of this lady proud of her son. Iwill inhabit the impracticable woods, and Rāma shall becomethe monarch. Let workmen lay out level roads in uneventracts; and let those men that are adepts in threading placesdifficult to pass through, follow us.\" When the prince hadspoken thus in behalf of Rāma, all those persons answeredhim in these excellent words, \"For saying this, may Lakshmiseated on the lotus remain at thy side; inasmuch as thouwishest to confer the earth on the eldest son of themonarch!\" Hearing that graceful speech of the king's son,tear-drops, begot of delight began to trickle from their eyesand adorned those noble countenances. And their griefremoved, with cheerful hearts, the counsellors, courtiers,and others hearing that speech (of the prince), said,\"O best of men, according to thy order, artizans as well aspeople cherishing a high regard for thee have been directedto lay out a road.\""

And as themighty throng began to proceed, it resembled the swellof the sea on the occasion of a parva. And numbersof men skilled in road-constructing went before furnishedwith various implements. And hewing away boughs, andplants and shrubs and woody projections, stones, and diversetrees, they went on preparing a road. And they set up treeswhere there were none, and at places they felled trees bymeans of axes, tankas, and daos, others possessed of greaterstrength and more powerful, with their hands uprooted massesof Virana and here and there leveled a rising ground. Andothers filled up with dust wells and capacious hollows, andspeedily leveled deep places air around. And those men threwbridges wherever they became necessary, and broke theearth wherever such a process was required, and excavatedwhenever it was necessary. In a short time, they made placespoor of water overflow with many and various expansesresembling the ocean. And in tracts void of water, theydigged divers receptacles of water, decorated with daises.And the way of the army, furnished with pavements ofbricks and clay, with trees bearing blosoms, eloquent withthe tunes of birds, decorated with pennons, sprinkled withsandal showers, and garnished with flowers of various kinds,looked exceedingly beautiful, like unto the way of thecelestials. Then having received the command of Bharata, themen that were in charge of the tents, ordered (the workmen)to pitch the tents, and when they had been pitched at aromantic spot filled with tasteful fruits, in consonance withthe injunction of the high-souled Bharata, the men decoratedsplendidly the tents which themselves were like theornaments of the road. And under an auspicious statf and at afavorable hour, men well up in the work set the encampmentof the high-souled Bharata. And the tenfs surrounded by anentrenchment paved with dust, containing images made ofsapphires, graced with goodly thoroughfares, lined withedifices, encircled by towers and walls, decorated withstreamers, having well-made high-ways, and appearinglike celestial daises and containing stately mansionswith dove-cotes, resembled the metropolis of Sakrahimself. And passing by the Jahnavi abounding in varioustrees and woods, of cool and crystal waters, and filled withmighty fishes, that way of the chief of men constructed byartizans, looked more and more lovely as it proceeded, as theunclouded sky looks beautiful at night, adorned withinumerable stars."

And as if fillihg the heavens,those powerful blasts of the trumpet repeatedly renderedBharata burning in grief the more aggrieved. Then awakingand silencing those sounds with saying—\"I am not the king,\"he said unto Satrughna, \"Behold, O Satrughna, in what amighty wrong the people are engaged, on account of Kaikeyi.The king Daçarātha has gone away throwing down on me(the burden of) this misery.

As Bharata Was mourning thus, the highly famousand virtuous Vasishtha accompanied by his disciples enteredthe court of the Ikshwāku king: built of entire gold,charming, dazzling with gems and gold: like unto Sudharmā itself.Sitting down on a golden seat furnished with an elegantcover, that one versed in all the Vedas commanded theenvoys, saying,—\"Do ye speedily with collected minds bringhither Brāhmanas and Kshatriyas and warriors andcounsellors and generals of forces and Satrughna with the otherprinces, and the famous Bharata and Yudhājit170 and Sumantraand others that are engaged in our welfare.\" Then therearose a mighty hubbub occasioned by people coming up incars, horses and elephants. And when Bharata arrived, thesubjects rejoiced as they used to rejoice on Daçarātha'sarrival; and as rejoiced the immortals on the arrival of himof an hundred sacrifices.

Then in words choked with themelodious voice of a swan, lamented and taxed the priest, in themidst of the assembly, \"Who like myself ever deprives onethat hath led a Brahmācharyya mode of life, that is endowedwith understanding and performed his bath after havingacquired learning, and that is always intent onrighteousness, of one's kingdom? How begot of Daçarātha, shallI deprive Rāma of his kingdom. It behoveth thee to speakrighteousness before this assembly. First-born, andforemost in merit, righteous-souled, and comparable unto Dilipaand Nahusha, Kākutstha deserves the kingdom, just asDaçarātha did. If I commit myself to this sin dishonorableand calculated to bring me to perdition, I shall in this worldbring disgrace on the race of the Ikshwākus. I do not atall relish the sin that has been committed by my mother.Remaining here with joined hands I bow down unto Rāmagone to the forest fastness. I will follow Rāma. That bestof men is the king.

I have already despatched beforehand personsserving for love as well as those for money, and layers of roadsand their keepers; and I intend setting out now.\" Havingsaid this, the virtuous Bharata attached unto his brother spoketo Sumantra skilled in counsel, who was by, saying, \"Up,and go, O Sumantra, at my command.

Hearing of thejourney to Rāma, for bringing him back the wives of thesoldiers apprised of the order that had been issued to the latter,being exceedingly delighted, hurried on.

Then shall they with happy hearts rangethe metropolis of my father, furnished with fair-lookingterraces, with the highways laid out orderly, crowned withlordly edifices, adorned with various gems, crowded by carsand elephants and horses, resounding with the notes oftrumpets, abounding in auspicious things, filled with fat andcontented people, having gardens and pleasure-houses, andpossessed of divers classes of men indulging festal mirth. Shall we,on the occasion of Rāma's return, with glad hearts peacefullyenter the city in company with that one firm in his promise?As the magnanimous son of the king was thus lamenting, thenight passed away. In the morning, with an unclouded sun,both, having made matted locks on the banks of the Bhāgirathi,crossed the river along with me. Wearing matted locksand clad in barks of trees, those persons possessed of mightystrength, like unto leaders of elephant-herds, equipped withexcellent arrows and quivers and bows—those repressors offoes, expecting (their return from exile), departed with Sitā.\""

  "Bālakāndam and Ayodhyākāndam": "Hearing the words of Guha, exceedingly unpleasant,Bharata as soon as he heard them, became plunged in thought.And then taking heart for a while, that tender-framed onepossessed of immense strength, gifted with leonine shouldersand length of arms, having expansive eyes resembling whitelotuses, young in years, and endowed with a handsomepresence, affected with great grief, was overpowered, like anelephant wounded in the heart with a goad. Seeing Bharatadeprived of his senses with his countenance covered withpallor, Guha became exceedingly agitated, like a treeduring an earthquake. Seeing Bharata in that condition,Satrughna who was near, taking the former on his lap, beganto cry, almost deprived of his senses and oppressed with grief.Thereat, all the mothers of Bharata, fasting, undergoingdistress, and afflicted with the calamity that had befallen theirlord, came forward, and surrounding Bharata, began to lamenthim fallen on the ground. And the distressed Kausalyadrawing nigh embraced him like a cow approaching her calf;and weeping from excess of grief, spoke unto Bharata, saying,\"My son, doth any malady afflict thy body? Now the lifeof this royal race is, without doubt, in thy hands. Rāmahaving gone away along with his brother, I shall, O son, live,seeing thee. King Daçarātha having departed this life, thoualone art our lord. Hast thou, my son, heard anythingunpleasant concerning Lakshmana; or the son of that onehaving an only son,172 who has gone to the forest along withhis wife?\" Having taken comfort for a while, that one ofhigh fame weeping, and solacing Kauçalyā, spoke unto Guha,saying, \"Where did my brother pass the night? And wheredid Sitā? And where did, again, Lakshmana? And in whatbed did he sleep, and what did he previously partake of? Dothou, O Guha, tell me this.\" Thereat, well pleased, Guha,the lord of Nishādas, related unto Bharata how he had actedin respect of Rāma, his dear guest, studious of his welfare.\"I procured for Rāma's use rice and fruits and roots and variouskinds of food. All these Rāma having truth for his prowessaccepted, but observing Kshatriya morality, he did not takethem. 'O friend, we ought not to take anything: ours is alwaysto give.' Thus did that magnanimous one beseech us. Onthe high-souled Lakshmana bringing water, Righavahaving drunk it, fasted along with Sitā. Then Lakshmana drankup the water that remained. Then the three with fixed mindssilently performed their adorations unto the Twilight. Afterthat, Sumitrā's son prepared a goodly bed for Rāghava,himself bringing Kuça grass. And in that bed lay down Rāmain company with Sitā. Next washing their feet, Lakshmanaturned away. This is the foot of the Ingudi, and this thatgrass. On it both Rāma and Sitā lay down that nightFastening on his back a pair of quivers filled with arrows,furnished with finger-fences, and taking his mighty bow,Lakshmana all night kept watch around. I also taking anexcellent bow, remained where remained Lakshmana andsurrounded by my kindred who stayed there vigilantly,equipped with bows, guarded him that resembled the mighty Indra.\""

  "Bālakāndam and Ayodhyākāndam": "Having heard everything, Bharata in company with thecounsellors went to the foot of the Ingudi tree and saw thebed of Rāma. And he said unto his mothers, \"That high-souled one lay down here on the ground during the nightand his limbs pressed this spot. Begot of that foremost ofmonarchs, the exalted and intelligent Daçarātha, Rāma doesnot deserve to sleep on the earth. How can that chief ofmen having reposed in beds furnished with pillows madeof deer-skins and having superb cloths, have lain down onthe earth? Always reposing in mansions and in upperapartments paved with silver and gold and supplied withexcellent bed-cloths, decked with heaps of flowers, perfumedwith sandal and aguru, hued like unto pale clouds, resonantwith the notes of many parrots,—in palaces going beforethe choicest of their class, ringing with music, and perfumed—like unto Meru itself, with their bases composed of gold,Rāma used to be awakened with vocal and instrumentalmusic, the tinklings of elegant ornaments and the peals ofgoodly mridangas—that subduer of foes being in due seasonhymned by the eulogists, and friends, bards and genealogists,with worthy ballads and penegerycs. (This assertion ofRāma's lying down on the ground) appears to me incredible:it doth by no means look unto me like truth. Forsooth, Iam amazed. I take it, this is a vision. Verily, no destinyis superior to Time, since Daçarātha's son, Rāma himself,had to repose on the earth,—and the beauteous beloveddaughter of Videha's king, and the daughter-in-law ofDaçarātha, had to lie down on the ground. This was the bedof my brother; on this hard spot did he turn his lovely limbs,and this grass was pressed by them. I think that the gracefulSitā adorned with ornaments slept in this bed, for here andthere are scattered particles of gold. It is clear that Sitā hadspread her sheet at this spot,—hence it is that fibres of silkare discoverable here. I deem that the bed of her lordappeareth agreeable unto a wife, since a girl tender and inaffliction, the chaste daughter of Mithilā experienced noinconvenience (in sleeping in one such). Ah, I am undone!Baleful am I, for it is on my account that Rāghava along withhis wife, lay down in such a bed, like one forlorn. Born in theimperial race, and capable of conferring happiness on all, thebringer-about of all good, why did Rāghava of dark bluehue like that Of a lotus, graceful, and crowned with red eyes,the inheriter of happiness and undeserving of misery,—havingleft his dear consummate kingdom, lie down on the ground?Surely the mighty-armed Lakshmana graced with auspiciousmarks is blessed,—he who in the time of dire adversityfolloweth his brother Rāma. And blessed is Videha'sdaughter who followeth her husband into the woods. Bereftof that magnanimous one, we have all been brought intojeopardy. The Earth without her helmsman seemethme quite empty, on Daçarātha having ascended the celestialregions and Rāma taken refuge in the wilderness. On Rāmahaving set up his dwelling in the forest, one (like me) dothnot even mentally covet this earth which had been protectedby the immense prowess (of Rāghava). With her wallsundefended, her horses and elephants unrestrained, and hergates left open, the defenceless metropolis deprived of herpower, placed in peril and without any protection, is surely notregarded by the enemies, like food mixed with poison. Fromthis day forth I will lie down on the ground, or on the grass,daily subsisting on fruits and roots, and bearing mattedlocks and a cloth of bark. And for his sake I will in futurelive happily in the woods. (By my doing so), the promiseof that high-minded one shall not be rendered null. Meresiding in the forest in the interests of my brother, Satrughnashall bear company; while my noble one will ruleAyodhyā assisted by Lakshmana. The twice-born ones willsprinkle Kākutstha in Ayodhyā. May the deities realize thisdesire of mine! Propitiated by me personally in various wayswith bent head, if he do not consent, then shall I ever stay withRāghava in the woods. Surely he cannot long persist inputting me off.\""

Why sleepestthou? Bring thou at once that lord of the Nishādhas, Guha.Good betide thee! He will take the army (over the stream).\"Thus urged by his brother, Satrughna said, \"Thinking ofthat noble one (Rāma), I have not slept, but have remainedawake in a like manner.\"173 As those chiefs of men werethus conversing with each other, Guha appearing in timewith joined hands, remarked, \"O Kākutstha, hast thou spentthe night happily on the banks of the river? And is itcontinuous good fortune with thee along with thy forces?\"Hearing Guhā's speech fraught with affection, Bharata everobedient unto Rāiria, spoke on his part, saying, \"Happilyhave we spent the night; and we have also been wellreceived by thee. Now let thy servants take us over bymeans of many boats.\" Thereat, bearing Bharata's mandate,Guha, bestirring himself, re-entered the city and addressed hiskinsfolk, saying, \"Arise ye! Awake! May good always attendyou! Do ye draw up the boats; I shall ferry the forcesover.\" Thus asked, they arising and bestirring themselves inconsequence of the king's command, brought up five hundredboats around. Others also known by the name of Swastika,bearing large bells on their prows, and banners, well deckedout, furnished with oars, and manned by bargemen, with theirjoints firmly constructed, (were brought up). And Guhahimself brought a graceful barge called Swastika, covered withpale woolen cloth, and resounding with music. On this boatascended Bharata, the mighty Satrughna, Kauçalyā, Sumitrā,and other wives of the king. The priests, and preceptorsbelonging unto the Brāhmana order, had already ascended.After (Bharata and others had got up), ascended the wives ofauxiliary princes, and cars and provisions were got on board.And the uproar consequent on the troops burning downdwellings, pressing down descents unto the river, and loadinggoods, spread on all sides. Then those boats hung withpennons, managed by the kinsfolk (of Guha), set off at speed withthe teeming folks that had got on board. And some of thesewere filled with women, and some with horses, and someconveyed cars and cattle of great value. And going to theother bank and landing the crowds on the store, the friendsand slaves (of Guha) while returning, displayed variousmovements (of the boats). And elephants graced with flagsbeing spurred on by their riders, began to cross the stream,appearing like (so many) winged hills. Others ascended boats,and others crossed on rafts, others crossed by means ofreversed pitchers, and others by their arms alone. Ferriedover the Gangā by the servants (of Guha), that beautifularmy graced with streamers, at the third muhurta arrivedat the romantic woods of Prayāga. Having made the armytake rest at its ease, and encamped it (at the woods ofPrayāga), that magnanimous one, Bharata, for the purposeof seeing the asylum of the ascetic Bharadwāja, went thither,accompanied by Ritwijas and Sadasyas."

And leaving his attire and arms,and clad in a silk cloth, that pious one placing the priestin front, went on foot. Then with the view of seeingBharadwāja, that descendent of Raghu leaving behind thecounsellors also, went in the wake of the priest. Assoon as Bharadwāja of rigid austerities saw Vasishtha,he at once rose from his seat, saying unto his disciples\"Arghya!\" On being called upon by Vasishtha, thathighly energetic one understood that it was Daçarātha'sson.

Do not apprehend any wrong fromme; and do thou not reproach me thus. Whatever mymother has said in relation to me, does not express my wish.I am not satisfied with that, nor do I endorse her speech.I, intending to pacify him, am going to that chief of men,with the view of taking him unto Ayodhyā and of payinghomage unto his feet.

I know that even this isthy intention; but for the purpose of making thy mind all thefirmer, I had asked thee in this wise; so that thy fame mightgreatly increase.

And a rare breeze set in, and the multitudesof Apsarās danced; and the celestials and the Gandharbassang, and the vinās let out their notes. And the dulcetsounds high and low furnished with Sama and measure,entered the Earth and the firmanent and the ears of allcreatures. When that celestial symphony, delightful unto theears of men, had thus developed itself, Bharata's forces sawthe workmanship of Viçwakarmā. That spot widening intoa level plain measuring five Yoyanas was covered with thickgrass resembling blue lapises. And on it stood Vilwas,and Kapithwas, Panasas, citrons, and Amalakas, and mangos,embellished with fruits. From the north Kuru had spreada wood capable of conferring every enjoyment; and abeautiful river coursed through bordered by many a tree. Andthere had arisen white edifices having four divisions; andstables for horses and elephants; and grand gatewaysbelonging unto palaces and mansions; and royal residences withgraceful gates, resembling white clouds, bearing whitegarlands and washed with fragrant waters, having four corners,and spacious, fitted up with beds, seats, and vehicles, havingevery kind of excellent sapid food, stocked with excellentedibles and apparels, having every variety of food, possessingwashed and bright vessels, with every description of seats,graceful, and accommodated with choice beds with coverlets.Permitted by the Maharshi, Kaikeyi's son, Bharata, enteredthat mansion abounding in gems. And he was followed bythe counsellors and the priests; and the latter beholding thearrangements of the palace, were filled with delight. AndBharata in company with the counsellors there went roundthe august royal seat, the chowri and the umbrella, worthyof a king. And having bowed down unto Rāma, heworshipped that seat. And then holding the chowri of hair, he satdown on the seat of a minister. Then the counsellors andpriests seated themselves according to rank. Andthereafter the general and the protector of the encampment (gotthemselves seated). Then at Bharadwāja's command, cameinto being near Bharata streams having payaca for theirslime. And at the pleasure of the Brāhmana, on both theirbanks arose charming dwellings, covered with pale clay. Andat that very moment there came twenty thousand womencommissioned by Brahmā, adorned with divine ornaments.And there came also twenty thousand females sent by Kuvera,decked out in gold and gems, pearls and corals. The sightof these was capable of filling men's minds with enchantingravishment. And there came from Nandana twenty thousanddamsels; and Nirada and Tumvuru and Gopa, resemblingthe sun in splendour. The Gandharba kings began to singbefore Bharata. And Alamvusha, and Migrakesi, andPundarikā, and Vāmana danced before Bharata, at the commandof Bharadwāja. And those blossoms that are in the celestialregions, and that bloom in the forest of Chaitraratha, becamevisible in Prayāga at the energy of Bharadwāja. And Vilwasdid the office of players on the Mridanga, and Vibhitakas,that of keepers of Soma, and Açwaththas became dancers, atthe energy of Bharadwāja. And Saralas, Tālas, Tilakas, andTamālas, being delighted, became hump-backed ones anddwarfs. And Sinsapas, Amalakis, Jamvus and other plantsof the forest, wearing the forms of females, stood at themansion of Bharadwāja. \"Let wine-drinkers drink wine, thehungry eat Pāyaça, and those that are inclined to it, feed onclean meat.\" And every seven or eight females taking aman, bathed him on the lovely banks of the rivers. Anddamsels furnished with expansive eyes, having wiped thepersons (of the bathers), pressed their legs, and thosemagnificent women made them drink (wine). And the keepersduly fed excellent horses, elephants, camels and Suravi's sons(oxen), with their (proper) food. And some persons possessedof mighty strength, being directed thereto, fed the bearersof the foremost Ikshwāku warriors with suger-canes, honey,and fried paddy. And the groom forgot his horse, and theelephant-keeper his elephant: that army there becametransported with wine and exhilaration. And sumptuouslyentertained with every enjoyment, with their bodies decked withred sandal, the soldiery in the company of bevies of Apsarās,exclaimed, \"To Ayodhyā will we not go, nor yet to Dandaka.Peace be unto Bharata, and may Rāma reap happiness\"!Thus did footmen and the riders and keepers of elephantsand horses, as well as others, having experienced such a state,utter words. And men by thousands, exceedingly delighted,sent up shouts. And saying, \"This is heaven\" the retinueof Bharata—the soldiers—began to dance and laugh andsing; and bearing garlands, they on all sides rushed bythousands. And beholding the inviting viands resemblingambrosia, they, although already fed, became desirous ofeating once again. And wearing new clothes, all the serrante,and maids, and females of the household, became exceedinglywell pleased. And elephants, and asses, camels, kine andhorses, and beasts and birds, being fed their fill, did nothunger after anything else. And there appeared no one whowore a soiled habit, or who was hungry, or melancholy, orwhose hair was covered with dust. And the people withwonder beheld before them vessels of precious metals bythousands graced with chaplets of flowers, filled with essencesof fruits and fragrant soups and curries and the flesh of goatsand bears, and white rice. And there were on the skirts of thewood wells having Pāyaça for their slime; and the kineyeilded whatever was asked; and all the trees dropped honey.And the tanks were filled with Maireya as well as with cleanhot meat of deer, peacocks, and cocks, dressed in pans. Andthere were rice-holders by thousands, and curry-pots byhundred thousands, and golden vessels by Arvudas. Andthere were pitchers and water-pots and cleaned vessels forchurning curd, filled with the same. And there were tanksof savoury and yellow butter-milk, well-tempered. Andthere were tanks filled with Rasāla;174 and others filled withmilk, and with sugar. And men saw sediments, acrid powdersand various others things in vessels, (or the purpose of bath,on the terraces of tanks; and tooth-cleaning sticks of Ançumānand other (trees); and white sandal paste lying before; andcleaned mirrors; and lots of cloths; and sandals; and shoesin pairs by thousands; and collyrium-pots; and combs; andbrushes; and bows at some places; and mail; and variouskinds of seats and beds. And they saw reservoirs for asses,camels, elephants, and horses, with easy descents, filled withwater to assist their digestion; and pools furnished withlotuses, of the hue of the firmament, with transparent water,comfortable for ablutions; and tender (plots of) grass allaround colored like blue lapises, to serve as pasture for beasts.Witnessing the wonderful hospitality provided by theMaharshi Bharadwāja, like unto a vision, the men marvelled.Thus entertained like unto celestials in Nandana, they passedthe night at the hermitage of Bharadwāja. Then taking thepermission of Bharadwāja, all the Gandharbas as well asthe superb damsels went away as they had come. And themen remained intoxicated and highly inebriate with theliquor, their persons daubed with goodly aguru and sandal;and the various elegant garlands beautiful to behold, lay bythemselves all around, crushed by the people."

Lean and trembling and in woful guise, Kauçalyāalong with the noble Sumitrā, with her hands took the feetof the ascetic. Despised universally because of herunrighteous desire, Kaikeyi also bashfully took hold of his feet,and, having circumambulated the mighty and venerableanchoret, stood near Bharata in dejection of spirits. Thenthe mighty ascetic Bharadwāja asked Bharata, \"O descendantof Raghu, I wish to know particularly about thy mothers.\"Thus accosted by Bharadwāja, the pious Bharata deftin speech said with joined hands, \"O reverend sir, shewhom thou beholdest depressed and emaciated through griefand fasting—resembling a very goddess—is the noble Queenof my father. This one, Kauçalyā, it is that gave birth untothat chief of men, having the powerful gait of a lion, Rāma,even as Aditi gave birth to Dhātā. She that stands at herleft hand, in dejected guise, is the noble Sumitrā afflictedwith sorrow, the second wife of the monarch—like aKarnikāra bough in a forest, with all its blossoms shrivelledup. The sons of this exalted lady are the youthful andheroic Lakshmana and Satrughna, having truth for theirprowess, and resembling celestials in shape. And her inconsequence of whose act those foremost of men have comeby crushing misfortune, and the king Daçarātha hath gone toheaven, deprived of his son,—wrathful and proud of her goodfortune, setting her heart on wealth—Kaikeyi, dishonorable,although endowed with the semblance of honor, do thouknow this wicked one intent on sin as my mother. In herdo I perceive the root of my mighty misfortune.\" Havingsaid this, with his words choked with emotion, that best ofmen with his eyes reddened, sighed like an enraged serpent.As Bharata was speaking thus, the great ascetic Bharadwājagifted with high understanding and knowing interest,answered Bharata, saying, \"O Bharata, thou ought not tocast any blame on Kaikeyi. This banishment of the king(Rāma), shall be for the good (of all). The banishment ofRāma shall surely be for the welfare of the gods and theAsuras and sages of concentrated souls.\" Thus blest,Bharata saluted the ascetic and went round him, and thensummoning the soldiery, said, \"Yoke.\" Thereupon, getting readyexcellent steeds and cars decked with gold, many peoplemounted, with the intention of departing. And male andfemale elephants with golden chains round their necks, andfurnished with banners, with the sounds (of bells), proceeded,like clouds at the end of the summer season. And then proceededvarious kinds of cars great and light of movement andof high value; and the infantry went on foot. And on amagnificent car went the ladies headed by Kauçalyā, withdelighted hearts, eager to see Rāghava. And ascending anelegant car resembling the infant sun or moon, driven bycharioteers, went the graceful Bharata well attired. Andthat mighty host abounding with horses and elephantsproceeded, blocking up the southern quarter, like a oolossalcloud arisen (in the sky), leaving behind on the otherbank of the Gangā woods inhabited by birds and beast*and coursing by rivers and. mountains.

And having proceeded a long way, the gracefulBharata, with his bearers extremely tired, said these wordsunto that foremost of counsellors, Vasishtha, \"Fromappearances, and from what I had heard, it is evident that we havearrived at that region which Bharadwāja had told us of.This is the mountain Chitrakuta and that the river Mandākini.And from a distance this forest appeareth like dark clouds.And now our elephants resembling hills afflict the romanticsides of Chitrakuta. And the trees scatter blossoms over thesides of the mountain, even as after summer sable clouds pourdown showers. O Satrughna, behold the realms inhabitedby Kinnaras, scattered with steeds, like the main withmakaras. And these herds of deer furnished with celerity, beingurged on, roam about like masses of clouds in the sky inautumn, propelled by the winds. And like the people of thesouth, these warriors bearing shields resembling clouds, areadorning their heads with ornaments of perfumed blossoms.And this forest, although void of men and dreadful inappearance, at present appeareth unto me like Ayodhyā, teemingwith people. The dust raised by the hoofs (of horses) standscovering the sky: anon the wind bearing it away, compassesmy pleasure. And, O Satrughna, see how fast these carsyoked with steeds and driven by skilful charioteers, areproceeding in the forest. And behold these beauteouspeacocks, which, being frightened, take refuge in the mountain—the home of feathered tribes. This country appears to meexceedingly lovely. This abode of the ascetics is likeonto the way to heaven itself. Male and female deer andPrishatas in the forest, beautiful to look at, appear as ifvariegated with flowers. Now let the soldiers go advisedlyand search this forest, so that they light upon those chiefsof men, Rāma and Lakshmana.\" Hearing Bharata's speech,persons with weapons in their hands, plunged into theforest, and those heroes presently discovered the top of a(column of) smoke. Having seen the top of the (column of)smoke, they came before Bharata and said, \"Fire cannotexist where there is no man present. Therefore it is evidentthat even here are those descendants of Raghu. But if thoseforemost of men, those subduers of their enemies, theprinces, be not here, there are others, being ascetics,resembling Rāma.\" Hearing their words acceptable unto thepious, that afflicter of hostile ranks, Bharata, said unto theentire army, \"Do ye carefully stay here: do not proceedfurther. I myself will go, and Sumantra and Dhriti.\" Thusdesired, the troops remained all about that place. Bharatawent away, keeping his gaze fixed in the direction of thetop of (the column of) smoke. Desired by Bharata to halt,that army, looking in the direction of the smoke, rejoicedsoon on learning that the beloved Rāma had arrived (at thatplace)."

My gentle one, look but at the hill abounding with flocks of various birds, adornedwith summits cleaving the welkin and teeming with mineralsubstances. And some parts of this monarch of mountains are like silver, and some are blood-red, and some yellow likethe hue of Manjisthā, and some lustrous like sapphires, andsome shining like blossoms or crystal or Ketakas, and someblazing like stars or mercury, and some dight in mineralsubstances. And the mountain shines, being filled with diversbeasts and multitudes of innocuous tigers, hyenas and bears,and thronged with innumerable birds. And overspread withmangos, rose-apples, and Asanas, and Lodhras,175 Piyālas,jacks, Ankolas, and Bhavyatiniças, and Vilwas, andTindukas, and bamboos, Kaçmaris, Arishtas, and Varanas, andMadhukas, sesames, and jujubes, and Amalakas, Nipas,canes, Dhanwanas, and citrons—all in full flower, and bearingfruits, umbrageous and charming,—the mountain attains anaccession of loveliness. And, thou gentle one, on thepicturesque plateau of the hill behold these intelligent couplesof Kinnaras engaged in sport at spots yeilding everyenjoyment; and look at their swords hung up on the boughs. Andsee the gorgeous apparel of Vidyādharis, as well as thecharming regions in which they sport. And like an elephantdropping the temporal juice, this hill appeareth beautiful withcascades, fountains and rillets, flowing here and there. Whomdoth not the breeze laden with the perfumes of many aflower, soothing the sense of smell, fill with delight? If, Oblameless one, I dwell (here) for many years with thee as wellas Lakshmana, grief cannot overcome me. O damsel, I takedelight in this picturesque peak abounding in flowers andfruits, and frequented by various birds. By this banishmentof mine, I have gained two things—my father has maintainedhis truth in religion, and Bharata has obtained his dearinterest. O daughter of Videha, art thou being pleased onviewing along with me on Chitrakuta, various objects gratefulunto mind, speech and body? O queen, this abode in theforest like unto ambrosia hath been declared by those royalsaints, my ancestors, as working out one's emancipation afterdeath. The giant crags of the mountain grace the place allround by hundreds; many and various-hued, blue and yellowaad pale and red. In the night, the annual herbs bythousands growing on this foremost of hills, shine and becomevisible by their own lustre, like flames of fire. And, O lady,some parts of the mountain appear like dwellings, and somelike gardens, and some, again, consist of single rocks (capableof accommodating numbers of men). And Chitrakuta looksas if it had arisen, riving the earth; and the fair front ofChitrakuta can be perceived from every point. Beholdthe beds of pleasure-seekers, consisting of the petals oflotuses, with Sthagaras, Panagas and Bhuryapatras fortheir coverlets. And, my wife, behold these lotus-garlandshave been crushed and scattered; and the various fruits havebeen partaken of. The mountain Chitrakuta abounding infruits and roots and waters, surpasses Kuvera's capital orSakra's city or the north Kurus. My wife, O Sitā, if inconsonance with my own excellent rules, I can, remaining in thepath of the pious, pleasantly pass this time along with thyselfand Lakshmana, then I shall attain the happiness resultingfrom observing the duties of one's race.\""

And the waters rendered muddy inconsequence of herds of deer drinking of them, as well as thegraceful descents unto the river, fill me with pleasure. And,my beloved, sages wearing matted locks and deer-skins, withbarks for their sheets, are in season performing their ablutionsin the river Mandākini. And observing rules, persons raisingup their arms, are worshipping the sun, and, O thou ofexpansive eyes, after these appear ascetics following vows, (engagedin Japa). And the hill seems to dance on the wind swayingthe tops of trees; and on both sides of the river, the treesare crowned with flowers and leaves. And behold the riverMandākini, somewhere with its waters resembling pearls,and somewhere with islets, and somewhere filled withpersons who have attained emancipation. O thou of slenderwaist, behold these hosts of flowers spreading along, andothers dipping themselves (in the stream). And, Oauspicious one, behold these sweet-throated birds, the Chakravākas,getting upon the islets, uttering pleasant notes. Methinks,O beauteous one, the sight of Chitrakuta and of Mandākiniis even more delightful than life in the metropolis, or thesight of thy own self. Do thou like unto her companionperform thy bath with me in this stream, whosewaters are perpetually stirred by emancipated ones,furnished with asceticism, self-restraint, and control overthe senses, who have had their sins removed. Do thou,O Sitā, perform thy ablutions in the Mandākini, scattering atthe same time, O girl, red and white lotuses. Do thou, mywife, always consider the wild animals as citizens, themountain as Ayodhyā, and this stream as the Sarayu. The virtuousLakshmana is ever obedient to my commands; and, OVideha's daughter, thou also art favourable to me. Thiscauses delight in my heart. Bathing thrice (in this river),and living on tasteful fruits and roots, I in thy company donot today wish either for Ayodhyā or royalty. Bathing inthis beauteous stream agitated by herds of elephants, whosewaters are drunk by elephants, lions and monkeys,—which isgraced with flowers, and which is decked with multitudes ofblossoms, there is no one who has not his fatigue removed,and who does not feel exhilarated.\" Having thus along withhis beloved one, spoken variously regarding the stream, thatperpetuator of the Raghu race, Rāma, began to range thecharming Chitrakata, resembling the collyrium in hue."

And filling the heavens, therearose clouds of dust raised by the army as well as an uproar.And at this time mad leaders of elephant-herds accompaniedby the latter, scared by the terrible tumult, scudded on allsides. And Rāghava heard the noise raised by the army; andalso saw all those leaders of elephant-herds scampering away.And having seen them running away and heard that hubbub,Rāma spoke unto Sumitrā's son, Lakshmana of flamingenergy, \"Ha!

A tremendous and dreadful uproarresembling the rumbling of cloulds is being heard; and inthe woods and mighty forest, deer and buffalos and herds ofelephants being accompanied by lions are suddenly scamperingaway in all directions. O Sumitrā's son, it behovesthee to learn whether any king or prince is hunting in theforest, or any ferocious beast is (ravaging the woods).

Therefore it behoves thee to learn allabout it, as has actually been the case.\"—Thereat, hurriedlyascending a flowering Sāla tree, Lakshmana surveying allsides, fixed his gaze on the east. And viewing the east, hediscovered a mighty army, abounding with elephants, horsesand cars, and consisting of equipped infantry. Thereupon,Lakshmana communicated unto Rāma tidings concerningthat army filled with elephants and steeds, and decked withcars and streamers; and spoke unto Rāma, saying, \"O nobleone, do you put out the fire; and let Sitā go into the cave.And do you string your bow and make ready the arrows anddon on your mail.\" Thereat, Rāma—chief of men—answeredLakshmana, saying, \"O son of Sumitrā, do thou (first)ascertain whom this host belongs to.\" Thus accostedby Rāma, Lakshmana, as if consuming that army by hiswrath resembling, fire, said, \"Having got himself installed,Kaikeyi's son, Bharata, anxious to render his royalty perfectlysafe, is coming hither for the purpose of slaying us both.Yonder is seen the graceful tree.

O hero, we have met withthat foe of ours for whom, O Rāghava, you, Sitā and myselfhave (experienced such misery), for whom, O Rāghava, youhave been cast off from the entire kingdom. Surely, Bharatashould be slain by me. O Rāghava, fault find I none inslaying Bharata; slaying a former wronger, one doth notreap unrighteousness. O Rāghava, there is religious meritto be reaped by slaying Bharata, who had formerly done uswrong. On this one being slain, you will rule the entireearth. To day shall Kaikeyi lusting after the kingdom, withgrief behold her son slain in battle by me, like a tree rivenby an elephant. I will also kill Kaikeyi along (with thehump-backed one), and her friends. Let the earth today befreed from foul sins. To day will I, O bestower of honor,vent my restrained ire and bad blood upon the hostile hosts,like fire set to a heap of hay. To-day with sharpenedshafts will I cut the bodies of the hostile hosts and drench thewoods of Chitrakuta with their blood.

And do they regularly informthee of the proper seasons for performing the fire-sacrifice?A dost thou regard the deities, the ancestral manes, thepreceptors like unto predecessors, the physicians, theBrāhmanas, and the servants? And dost not disregard thepreceptor Sudhanwā, versed in excellent arms whetherinspired with mantras or not, and accomplished in theknowledge of polity? And, my child, hast thou employed as thyconcillors, persons, heroic, learned, self-controlled, well-born,and understanding signs, who are like thy own self? Odescendant of Raghu, counsel well kept by clever councillorsversed in lore, is the root of victory with kings. And thouhast not come under the sway of sleep? And thou awakestat the proper hour?

And thy counsel dothnot range the kingdom (i. e. doth not take air)? And,O descendant of Raghu, having determined upon a coursecosting small effort but fraught with a mighty result, thousetst about it sharply and delayest not? And do the(auxiliary) kings know only those acts of thine that havebeen accomplished or those that are well nigh so, and notthose that thou intendest to set thine hand to? And doothers through inference or appearances come at aknowledge of thy counsels, although undivulged to others by thyselfor thy counsellors; and (do thou and thy ministers) attainto a knowledge of others' counsels? And passing by athousand dunces, dost thou set thy heart on having a singlewise man? In times of pecuniary stress, a wise man standsin excellent stead. And although a king might be surroundedby a thousand or ten thousand fools, yet he can count uponno assistance (at their hands). And a single able counsellor,intelligent, heroic, and sagacious, bringeth great prosperityupon a king or a prince.

He that doth not slay aphysician skilled in ways and means, a servant given toenlisting the sympathies of his fellow-servants against hismaster, or a hero that covets riches, is slain (by them). Andhast thou chosen for thy general one that is confident,is endowed with intelligence and fortitude, sprung ina respectable race, and attached and able? And dostthou practically honor thy foremost warriors possessedof prowess, who have already given evidence of theirmanliness? And dost thou at the proper time grant thysoldiers what thou shouldst—provision and pay; and dost notdelay in doing this? If the proper time for granting provisionand pay be passed, the servants get wroth with their masterand tax him; and great is the evil that springs herefrom.And are the principal descendants of our race attached untothee; and are they, when enlisted on thy side withconcentrated minds, ready to lay down their lives?

And, my child, dost thou protect the prosperousand renowned Ayodhyā, inhabited formerly by our heroicpredecessors; bearing a true name; having strong gates; filledwith elephants, steeds, and cars; thronged by thousands; withnoble Brāhmanas, Kshatriyas and Vaiçyas breathing highspirits, and with their senses controlled, each engaged in hisown task; abounding in people learned in the Veda; andsurrounded with palatial mansions of various shapes? And,O descendant of Raghu, are the flourishing provinces markedwith hundreds of Chaityas, filled with prosperous people,graced with abodes of deities, places for distributing water,and tanks, with men and women in happy mood, gay withmeetings and festivities, having their outskirts well furrowed,provided with beasts, void of ill feelings, depending on tanksfor their water supply, charming, renounced by fierce animals,free from all kinds of fear, decked with mines, left byunrighteous people, and well governed by my predecessors,—having a good time of it? And do agriculturists andcowherds find favor in thy sight? And remaining in theirrespective vocations, do they enjoy happiness? And dostthou maintain them by securing unto them what they wish forand removing from them what they wish away? All thedwellers in his dominions should be protected by the king.And dost thou conciliate the females; and are they wellprotected by thee? And dost thou not regard them; anddost thou not open unto them thy mind? And are the woodswhere elephants breed, kept by thee; and hast thou kine?And dost thou not foster mares and female-elephants?And dost thou show thyself daily in the court, well robed?And rising in the morning, dost thou show thyself in thehigh-ways? And do thy servants boldly presentthemselves before thee; or do they all keep away? A middlecourse contributes to their good fortune. And are all theforts furnished with wealth, corn, arms, water, machines,artizans, and bowmen? And are thy incomings great andoutgoings slender? And, Raghu's descendant, thou dostnot give away thy coffers unto the undeserving? And dostthou spend thy wealth in the interests of the deities, or thepitrtis, or the Brāhmanas who have come unto thee, orwarriors, or friends? If any respectable, pure-spirited and cleanperson happen to be accused by some one of theft or othercrimes, dost thou from covetuousness punish him without firsthaving him tried by persons versed in scripture? And, O bestof men, is a thief, that hath been caught, interrogated (as to hisguilt), and found with the stolen property on his person, setfree (by thy men) from motives of gain? And do thycounsellors, O descendant of Raghu, accomplished in various lore,uninfluenced by greed, consider the conduct of both the richand the poor involved in peril? O son of the Raghu race,the tears of those who have been falsely charged with anyoffence, (and who have failed to obtain justice), dropping,destroy the sons as well as the beasts of the ruler that mindshis own comfort only. And dost thou with these three—gifts,mind and word—try to win over aged people, boys,physicians, and the principal ones? And dost thou salutespiritual preceptors, aged persons, ascetics, gods, guests,Chaityas, emancipated ones, and Brāhmanas? And thou dostnot oppose righteousness by interest, or interest by virtue,or both by desire, intent on gratifying the senses? And, Oforemost of conquerors, dost thou, O thou cognisant oftime, in season resorting to interest, desire, and virtuerespectively, attain them, O bestower of boons? And doBrāhmanas versed in all religious lore and knowing interest,together with the citizens and the inhabitants of theprovinces wish for thy happiness, O highly wise one? Atheism,untruthfulness, inattention, anger, procrastination,companionship with evil persons, indolence, gratification of thesenses, consultation with a single person concerning theneeds of a kingdom, taking counsel with those that arecognisant of evils alone, omission to take in hand a taskthat hath been decided upon, divulgence of counsel,noncommencement of a course in the morning, and marchingagainst all the foes at one and the same time,—hast thou eschewed these ten and four faults? And, Odescendant of Raghu, truly understanding the tenth,177 fifth,178fourth179 and seventh180 classes as well as the eighth,181 and thirdones,182 and the three kinds of learning,183 and victory overthe senses, and the evils human and superhuman, sixattributes,184 and the (peculiar) duties (of royalty), andthe twenty classes,185 and the kinds of Prakritis186 andMandala,187 and Yatrā,188 chastisement, and war and peacehaving each two sources; dost thou with due order observe allthese? And, O wise one, dost thou, as laid down in theordinance, take counsel, severally and in a body with three or fourmen? And dost thou observe the Vedas? And dost thouperceive the fruit of thy acts? And have thy wives borne children?And has thy knowledge of scripture borne fruit? And,descendant of Raghu, is thy intellect going the way that Ihave indicated above? This course is conducive to long life,and fame; and virtue, desire and interest. And, O child, artthou following the course that was followed by our ancestors?And art thou maintaining the conduct that is excellent andpasses along pious ways? And, O son of Raghu, thou dostnot alone partake of sapid meats thyself alone? And dostthou share them with those friends who expect it? Thelearned king ruling (all) righteously—that chastiser of thesubjects—the monarch attaining duly the entire earth, goingaway from hence, acquires the celestial regions.\""

It behoveth thee to tell me allthis.\" Thus accosted by the high-souled Kākutstha, Kaikeyi'sson, suppressing his grief by a strong effort, with joinedhands said, \"O noble one, forsaking us all, our fatherpossessed of mighty arms, having performed this terrible task, inconsequence of being urged by a woman, my mother Kaikeyi,hath gone to heaven afflicted with grief on account of hisson, O repressor of foes. And she hath committed a signalsin capable of destroying her fame. And without obtainingthe kingdom which she had coveted as the fruit of heraction, a widow tried with grief, my mother will fall into aterrible hell. Now it behoves thee to extend thy favor untome who have become thy slave. Do thou this very day getthyself installed in the kingdom, like unto Indra himself.All these subjects and our widowed mothers have comeunto thee. It behoves thee to show thy favor unto them.Thou art the first-born; and meet it is that thou shouldst getthyself installed, O bestower of honor. Therefore do thoureceive the kingdom righteously and fulfil the desire of thyfriends. And like the autumnal Night on having theunclouded moon, let the entire Earth cease to be a widow onhaving thee, her lord. With bent head I beseech thee alongwith these counsellors. It behoves thee to show thy favor untothy brother, disciple, and slave. Therefore, O chief of men,thou ought not to pass by this honored band of ancestralministers, who have always been serving this race.\" Havingsaid this, with tears flooding his eyes, the mighty-armed sonof Kaikeyi, Bharata, again took Rāma's feet on his head.Thereupon Rāma embracing his brother Bharata resemblinga mad elephant, and sighing again and again, said, \"Of ahigh race, possessed of strength, endowed with energy, andvowed unto sterling worth of character, how can one likeme commit sin for the sake of dominion? Fault find I noneever so small in thee, thou destroyer of foes. Nor doth itbecome thee from puerility to tax thy mother, O exceedinglywise one, O thou that art sinless, superiors may act as theylist in relation to those wives and sons of theirs that are aftertheir heart. And this also thou shouldst learn that wives,sons and disciples should always be obedient as has beenheld by the emancipated ones. O mild one, the monarchis competent to make me stay in the woods clad in blackdeer-skin, as to establish me in the monarchy. And, O thouconversant with morality, O foremost of those observingrighteousness, in respect of virtuous conduct, a mother shouldbe as much regarded (by a son) as a father is. How can I,O descendant of Raghu, having been told by my righteousfather and mother—'Go to the woods'—act otherwise? Thouought to receive the kingdom, Ayodhyā, honored of men;and I ought to dwell in Dandaka dressed in bark. Havingmade this division of duties in the presence of all, and alsoenjoined this, the mighty monarch, Daçarātha, hath ascendedheaven. That superior of all, even the virtuous king, is thyevidence. It behoves thee to enjoy that which hath beenassigned unto thee by thy sire. And, O mild one, takingrefuge in the forest of Dandaka for fourteen years, I will actthe part that hath been set apart for me by my magnanimousfather. What hath been assigned to me by that one respectedby all men, my high-souled father resembling the lord ofcelestials himself, is my prime good; the masterdom of allthe worlds I would decline (should it be opposed to the willof my sire).\""

And on that thunder-bolt of a speechbeing uttered by Bharata, like unto a (real) thunderbolthurled in battle by the enemy of the Dānavas (Indra), thatsubduer of foes, Rāma, stretching his arms, fell down to theearth, like a blossoming tree that hath been hewn by an axe.Seeing that lord of the world and mighty bowman, Rāma,fallen, like a sleeping elephant fatigued with turning up earthwith its tusks, his brothers exercised with sorrow, broke outinto lamentations, and along with Videha's daughter beganto sprinkle water (on his face). Then regaining hisconsciousness, Kākutstha shedding tears from his eyes, distressfullyaddressed himself to speech. And hearing that lordof earth, his sire, had gone to heaven, that righteous onesaid unto Bharata words fraught with virtue and interest,\"What shall I do with Ayodhyā, my sire having gone theway ordained by the gods? And who will govern her,now that she hath been deprived of that foremost ofmonarchs? Of fruitless birth that I am, what can I do for thatmagnanimous one? And of him that renounced his lifefrom grief on my account. I have not even performed thelast rites. Ah! Bharata, thou, O sinless one, art blessed,since by thee as well as by Satrughna have been performedall the funeral rites of the king. To Ayodhyā, bereft of themonarch, having none to preside over her destinies, andmany rulers, will I not return even when the term of myabode in the woods has been passed. My father having goneto the other world, who, O subduer of enemies, will againcounsel me when, my stay in the forest being over, I shall havereturned unto Ayodhyā? And from whom shall I hearthose words grateful unto the ear, which my father gratifyingme used to speak unto me when I happend to do somethingwell?\" Having thus addressed Bharata, Rāghava burningin grief, spoke unto his wife, with her countenance resemblingthe full moon, saying, \"O Sitā, thy father-in-law is deadand, O Lakshmana, thou art fatherless. Bharata hascommunicated unto me the sad intelligence that our father hathascended heaven.\" When Kākutstha had said this, tearsbegan to shower forth from the eyes of the renowned princes.Then all those brothers pacifying as best they could Rāmastricken with sorrow, said unto him, \"Do thou perform thewatery rites of that lord of the earth, our sire.\" Havingheard that her father-in-law, the king, had gone to thecelestial regions. Sitā with her eyes filled with tears, couldnot see her beloved. Thereupon, pacifying the weepingdaughter of Janaka, Rāma moved with grief, spoke unto thedistressed Lakshmana, saying, \"Do thou bring Ingudi fruitsas well as a piece of new bark. I will go to perform thewatery rites of our high-souled sire. Let Sitā go first. Dothou follow her. I shall go last. Even this is the courseof those in mourning.\" Then that magnanimous one, havinga knowledge of the soul, mild, graceful, capable of controllinghis senses, steady in his regard for Rāma, and ever followinghim—Sumantra—in company with those sons of the king,having cheered up Rāghava, brought him to the auspiciousriver, Mandākini. Then those illustrious ones, havingin distress arrived at the river Mandākini, having convenientdescents, charming, ever furnished with blossoming woods,and of rapid currents; and approached its descents, goodlyand void of mud, offered water unto the monarch, uttering,\"May this be so!\" And the protector of the earth (Rāma),holding water with his joined hands, facing the south, saidweeping, \"O foremost of monarchs, may this clear waterknowing no deterioration, reach thee, who hast gone to theworld of the ancestral manes!\" Then drawing nigh untothe marge of the Mandākini, the energetic Rāghava alongwith his brothers, offered the Pinda unto his father. Andplacing the Ingudi Pinda mixed with juyube on a bed ofdarbha Rāma crying in distress, said, \"O mighty monarch,do thou well pleased feed on this, which we also live upon.That which is the fare of an individual, is also the fare ofhis divinities.\" Then that foremost of men ascending thebank of the stream by the self-same way, got up on thecharming side of the hill. And having arrived at the gate ofthe cottage of leaves, that lord of the earth held bothBharata and Lakshmana with his hands. And there the hillreverberated at the sounds raised by the brothers wailingalong with Vaidehi, like unto lions roaring. Andperceiving the loud uproar of those mighty ones engaged in offeringwater unto their sire, indulging in lamentations, the army ofBharata became agitated. And they said, \"For certainBharata hath met with Rāma; and this mighty noise proceedsfrom them, as they are bitterly mourning their deceasedsire.\" Thereat leaving aside their vehicles, they with onemind, rushed towards the spot wherefrom proceeded theuproar. And of those that were tender, some went on horses,and some on elephants, and some on ornamented chariots,while others went on foot. And eager to behold Rāmastaying away for a short time, though seeming to do so for a longperiod, all the men at once went to the hermitage. Anddesirous of witnessing the meeting of the brothers (withRāma), they with all despatch proceeded by means of variousvehicles consisting of beasts and cars. And the groundtrodden by the wheels of innumerable cars, emitted loud sounds,like those emitted by the sky on clouds gathering.And frightened by the uproar, elephants accompanied byfemale ones, perfuming all sides (by the fragrance oftemporal juice), went to another forest. And boars, and deer,and lions, and buffalos, and Srimaras, and tigers, andGokarnas, Gayals and Prishatas were striken with panic. Andwild with alarm, Chakravākas and swans, and Natyuhas,and Plavas, and Karandavas, and male coels, and Kraunchas,fled away in all directions. And the welkin was envelopedby birds frightened by the noise, as the earth was covered bymen, and both the sky and the land then gave out greateffulgence. As the people suddenly saw that foremost of men,the sinless and illustrious Rāma seated on the ground,accusing Kaikeyi as well as the vile Mantharā, the peopleapproached Rāma, with their countenances discoveringtears. Seeing those men oppressed with grief with theireyes filled with tears, that one cognizant of virtue like fathersand mothers, embraced those that deserved it And heembraced some persons; and some offered him salutations.And the king's son, as each deserved, properly received themalong with their friends and equals in age. And the sounds,produced by those high souled persons lamenting,resounding the earth and the sky, and the mountain-caverns, andall the cardinal points, were heard like peals of Mridangas."

Thereupon Kauçalyā, withher eyes filled with tears and her countenance rendered pale,observed unto the forlorn Sumitrā as well as the other wivesof the king, \"Sacred like unto a first wife, in this forest thisis the landing-place of those unfortunate ones of untiringenergy, who had been deprived of the kingdom. From here,O Sumitrā, doth thy son, Saumitri, ever vigilant, personallyprocure water for my son. Although thy son performeth aservile office, yet he is not to blame: (the performance of) thatalone which serves no purpose of his brother possessed ofmany perfections, could bring blame upon him. To day let thyson, who doth not deserve such toilsome work, cease toperform that office which is fraught with hardships fit only for thebase.\" That lady of expansive eyes happened to see on theearth the Ingudi pinda, which had been placed by Rāmafor his sire on the darbha with their tops pointingsouthwards. Seeing this, which had been placed on the ground byRāma disconsolate for his sire, the noble Kauçalyā addressedall the wives of Daçarātha, saying, \"Do ye behold this thathath been duly offered to the high-souled descendant ofRaghu—lord of the Ikshvāku race—by Rāghava. I do notdeem this as fit fare for that magnanimous monarchresembling a celestial, who had enjoyed every luxury (in life).Having enjoyed this earth bounded by the four seas, how can thatlord of the world, resembling on earth the mighty Indra,feed on this Ingudi pinda? Nothing appeareth to me moredeplorable in this world than this that the auspicious Rāmahath offered an Ingudi cake unto his father. Seeing the Ingudipinda offered by Rāma unto his father, why doth not myheart break into a thousand shivers? Now the traditionin vogue among men, appearth to be true, viz., that \"the farethat is partaken by a person, is also partaken by his deity.\"Then those that were co-wives with her, consoled thedistressed Kauçalyā; and, (entering the asylum), beheld Rāmalike an immortal dropped from the celestial regions. SeeingRāma, who had been deprived of every comfort, his mothers,overwhehhed with grief and distress, began to shed tears,lamenting. Raising his mothers, that foremost of men,Rāma, true to his promise, took hold of those lotus feet oftheirs. And those ones furnished with expansive eyes, (ontheir turn) by means of their fair hands of delicious feelfurnished with soft fingers and palms, fell to rubbing the dust offRāma's back. After Rāma had done, Sumitrā's son also, seeingall his mothers, with sorrow gently paid his reverence untothem with affection. Thereat, as they had treated Rāma, all theladies treated that one sprung from Daçarātha, Lakshmana,graced with auspicious marks. Sitā also with her eyes filledwith tears, having taken hold of the feet of her mothers-in-law, stood before them in distressful guise. Embracing thatwoeful one in banishment, even as a mother doth her daughter,Kauçalyā, smitten with grief, said, \"The daughter of Videha'sKing, and the daughter-in-law of Daçarātha, and the wife ofRāma himself—why doth such a lady undergo misery in thelone forest? O Vaidehi, beholding thy face like unto a lotusheated under the sun, or a lily that hath been crushed, orlike unto gold covered with dust, or the moon enveloped byclouds, grief begot of this vortex of disaster that is in mymind, fiercely burneth me, as fire consumeth a structure.\" Ashis wretched mother was thus speaking, Bharata's elderbrother, Rāghava, approaching, took the feet of Vasishtha.Having taken hold of the feet of the priest resembling aflame, and of accumulated energy,—like unto that lord of theimmortals, Indra, taking the feet of Vrihaspati, Rāghava satdown with him. Then behind them (Rāma and Vasishtha),along with his own counsellors, and principal citizens, andgenerals, and persons of eminent piety,—sat the virtuousBharata in the presence of his elder brother. SeeingRāghava in the guise of an ascetic, flaming in grace, theexceedingly powerful Bharata with joined palms sat down incompany with his brother, like the great Indra of controlledfaculties in presence of Prajapāti. \"What will Bharata, havingbowed unto Rāghava and paid him homage, will say to him?\"—this intense curiosity arose in (the minds of) all the noblepersons present there.

Then Bharataaddressed Rāma in the midst of those friends, saying, \"Mymother was (first) pacified (by grant of the kingdom.)The kingdom is (now) mine. I grant the same unto thee.Do thou enjoy the kingdom rid of its thorns. Like unto adyke forced by a torrent during the rains, this mightymonarchy is difficult of being protected save by thee. As amule is incapable of imitating the course of a horse, or asbirds, that of Tarkshya, I, O Lord of earth, lack the strengthto imitate thee. O Rāma, ever happy is the life of him thatothers depend upon for subsistence: unhappy is the life ofthe person that depends upon others for support. As a treeplanted by a person, and by him made to increase, (until atlast), sending out branches, a mighty tree, it isincapable of being got up by a dwarf; and then, if, flowering, itshow no fruits, it cannot contribute to thesatisfaction of htm for whom it hath been planted. O mighty-armed one, this comparison is meant for thee. This189 itbehoves thee to apprehend, inasmuch as thou art ourexcellent lord, and thou dost not teach us who depend upon theefor support.

TheDestoyer draws him both here and hereafter. Those thatincrease, are destined to deteriorate; those that go upward,ultimately fall, those that come together, separate in the end;and life at length meets with death. As a ripe fruit hath noother fear than fall, so man who is born, hath no other fearthan death. Even as a stout-pillared edifice, gettingdilapidated, waxes weak, so men coming under the sway of decrepitudeand death, get enfeebled. A night that hath gone by, dothnot return, as the full Jamunā, when she hath entered theocean, doth not come back. In this world, days and nightspass away with creatures, and speedily impair their lives,even as in summer the rays (of the sun) (dry up) thewaters. Do thou therefore deplore thyself. Why dost thoulament any thing else? Every one's life is decreasing, whetherhe sits or moves. Death goeth with one, sitteth downwith one, and, after having gone a long way, returneth withone. The person is filled with folds in the skin, the hairhath grown hoary, the individual is enfeebled because of age,—by doing what, can he prevent this? People rejoice on therising of the sun; they feel delighted at the approach ofnight,—but they do not understand that their lives have(meanwhile) been shortened. People are exhilarated at thecommencement of a new season in novel fashion; creaturesget their lives shortened at the change of seasons. As onthe mighty ocean, one piece of wood comes in contactwith another; so, a person, having been in association withanother, is seperated from him in time. In this way,wives and sons and kindred and wealth, having been inassociation, go away; their separation is certain. Thereexists not one in this world that can change one's nature asreceived. A person lamenting a dead individual, hath nopower to prevent his own death. As, while one isproceeding on a road, another stationed by the way, says,'I too will go in thy wake', even so, the way that hathbeen followed by our predecessors, (must be followed aswell by us.) Why should people mourn (for deceasedrelatives), when they are themselves subject to the fate thatknoweth no turning? (Perceiving the destruction of) lifedeclining, like unto a current that never turneth back, oneshould engage his soul in happiness; for all men are said tobe born for the same. My child, our righteous sire, who,after having performed excellent and entire sacrifices,accompanied with dakshinās, hath repaired to heaven,honored of the good, should not be mourned.190 Havingrenounced his human frame wasted and worn out withage, our father hath attained celestial state, whichexists in the regions of Brahmā. Such an one shouldnever be mourned by any wise person like thee ormyself, accomplished in learning and more than ordinarilyintelligent. Such manifold grief and mourning andlamentation should be renounced by intelligent and firmpersons in all conditions in life. Do thou cast off this grief:let not sorrow overpower thee. Going thither, stay in thatcity. And, O best of speakers, this was also enjoined byour sire of controlled senses. I also must do my noblefather's will as to whatever that one of pious acts has laidupon me. O subduer of foes, it is not proper for me to passby his orders. So thay are also worthy of being honored bythee. He is our friend and father. O descendant of Raghu,that mandate of our righteous father, acceptable unto me,will I obey by abiding in the woods. O foremost of men,(good in) the next world is capable of being attained by anhonest and pious person crowned with sterling virtues,ever following his superiors. O best of men, thinking thatour father Daçarātha has attained excellent state, do thou,resorting to all noble qualities, seek thy welfare in the nextworld.\" Having said these significant words unto his youngerbrother, with the view of making him obey the injunctionsof their father, that lord, the magnanimous Rāma, paused."

Pain doth not afflict thee,nor doth pleasure exhilarate. Thyself the exemplar of evenaged people, thou referrest to them on doubtful points(of morality). 'Living like unto dead and existing likeunto non-existing'—what shall make a person that hathattained this intellectual state, grieve? O lord of men, hethat like unto thee understands the nature of the soul andits environment coming by any calamity, ought not todespond. Thou resemblest, O Rāghava, the god instrength, and art magnanimous, and truthful in promise!and knowest every thing and art endued with intelligence.Calamity, however unbearable it may be, should notoverpower a person like thyself furnished with such virtuesand cognizant of life and death. The sin that in my absencefrom home hath been perpetrated by my mean-mindedmother doth not find favor in my sight. Be thou thereforepropitous to me. I am bound by the fetters of religion. Forthis it is that I do not by a severe penalty slay my wickedmother deserving of chastisement. How having sprungfrom Daçarātha of righteous deeds and born of immaculaterace, and knowing virtue and vice, can I commit such areprehensible action? Daçarātha is our superior, ofmeritorious acts, aged our king, a departed spirit, and our father, itis on account of this that I do not censure our fatherwho is a deity unto us. O cognizant of virtue, what virtuousperson conversant in morality, should, seeking the pleasureof his wife, commit such a sinful act devoid of bothrighteousness and interest? 'Creatures, as their end approaches,lose their sense' this ancient adage has been illustrated inthe world by the course the king has taken. Do thou, intentupon bringing about good, redeem the wrong that hath beendone by our sire through anger, ignorance and recklessness.The son that repaireth the wrong done by his father byacting contrary to the latter is in this world consideredreally a son; but not he that acteth otherwise. Be thou that(real) son (of the monarch). Do thou not approve the actionof thy father, since what he has done is divorced fromrighteousness and is blameworthy. Do thou rescue all these—Kaikeyi, myself, my father, our friends and adherents,and the whole body of the citizens as well as theinhabitants of the provinces. Where is the forest? And whereis Kshatriya morality? Where are matted locks? And whereis thy government of the country? It behoves thee notto act in such an untoward way. Even this is the firstduty of a Kshatriya, viz.,—getting oneself installed,—bymeans of which, O highly wise one, he can compass thegovernment of the people. What base Kshatriya settingaside this indubitable morality, resorts to a dubious andinaupicious course, which should be followed by the oldalone? But if thou be bent upon practising this austeremorality, do thou undergo this trouble, after having righteouslyruled the four orders. O thou cognizant of morality, thoseversed in duty say that of the four modes of life, the lifeof the householder is the foremost. Why then dost thouwish to renounce the same? I am inferior to thee in learning,in position, and in birth. How can I then govern theearth, thou existing? Void of sense and quality, a boy, andinferior to thee in point of years, I, deprived of thee, cannot live. O thou cognizant of morality, do thou, along with thyfriends, according to thy proper morality rule this entireancestral kingdom rid of its thorns and enjoying tranquillity.Even here, O thou cognizant of the Mantras, let allthe subjects and the Ritwijas with Vasishtha, versed inthe Mantras, install thee. Having been installed, go to Ayodhyā,for the purpose of governing it, having with ourassistance conquered thy enemies by thy strength, like Vāsavaconquering (his foes) with the help of the Maruts. Havingfreed thyself from thy threefold debts, do thou govern me,repressing thy foes, and propitiating thy friends with everygratification. O noble one, to-day let thy friends rejoicein consequence of thy coronation. To day let those thatintend to do thee harm, being frightened, fly to the tencardinal points. O foremost of men, wiping out the disgraceof my mother, do thou emancipate our sire from sin. Ibeseech thee with bent head. Be thou merciful unto me,unto all our friends, and, O great lord, unto all creatures ingeneral. But, if disregarding my solicitations, thou wendfrom here to the forest, I shall go along with thee.\" Althoughthus besought and propitiated by Bharata with bent head,that lord of the earth, Rāma, possessed of strength,established in the words of his father, did not decide for going.Witnessing that wonderful firmness in Rāghava, the peoplewere at one and the same time delighted and depressed.They were aggrieved because he would not go to Ayodhyā;they rejoiced on seeing his firm resolution. Then theRitwijas, the citizens, and their leaders, and the motherswith their senses lost and with tears in their eyes,extolled Bharata as he was speaking thus; and, bowing downunto Rāma, they directed their solicitations together."

O brother,formerly when our father espoused the hand of thy mother,he promised her the kingdom as her marriage portion. Thenon the occasion of the war between the gods and the Asuras,that master, the king, well pleased (with her), beingbesought, granted her a boon.

Who is whose friend? And to what is oneentitled and by virtue of what relation? And who is such?Since a creature is born alone and dies alone, a person thatcherishes his father and mother with affection, must, ORāma, be looked upon as a madman. No individual hathany one (in this world). As on the eve of setting out foranother country, a person stays somewhere (outside thevillage he lives in), and the next day goes away, renouncingthat abode, even such are a man's father and mother, houseand wealth. O Kākutshta, worthy people never bearaffection towards a mere abode. Therefore, O best of men,leaving thy ancestral kingdom, thou ought not to abide in thedisagreeable forest filled with dangers and difficulties. Dothou get thyself sprinkled in the prosperous Ayodhyā. Thecity expects thee wearing a single woven braid. O king'sson, enjoying costly regal pleasures, do thou sport inAyodhyā, like Sakra in the celestial regions. Daçarātha is noneunto thee, and thou too art none unto Daçarātha: He isquite other than thy sire; and thou hast no connectionwith him. Therefore, do thou act as I tell thee. A fatheris merely an instrumental cause (touching the generationof his child). A father's semen coming in contact with amother's blood, at the time befitting conception, a personis brought into being. The king hath gone the way heshould. This is the nature of all creatures. But thoufor naught denyest thyself (the manliness of monarchalpower). Those that disregarding interest are devoted tovirtue, do I mourn—and not others; for having sufferedmisery here, they in the end meet with extinction.

Doth any dead person feed?If food partaken by one is transferred to the body of another,offer Srāddha unto one going to a distant land, and thatshall serve for his provender on the way. Works (onmorality) enjoining—'Worship,' 'Give away,' 'Be initiated,''Observe rites,' 'Renounce',—have been composed byintelligent persons, for inducing people to be charitable.

  "Bālakāndam and Ayodhyākāndam": "Hearing Javali's words, Rāma having truth for prowess,by help of an exceedingly subtle intellect uninfluenced (underthe exhortations of that sage), said, \"What thou, wishingfor my welfare, hast dwelt upon, though wearing the guise ofa good action, is really not such; and though appearing to bebeneficent, is really calculaled to entail misery. The personthat with his sinful acts sticking to him, walketh astray,as well as he that holdeth up (unto others) different patternsof character (from those recommended by scripture), dothnot win honor with the good. One's character (fashionedaccording to scripture) shows whether one is high-born orbase, heroic or vainly priding himself on his manliness,pure or impure. (But by adopting the code of conductinculcated by thee), a mean character may appear as a nobleone, one bereft of purity may appear pure, an inauspiciousindividual may seem auspicious, and one of vile ways mayappear honest. If I adopt this unrighteous course, calculatedto produce confusion of castes, and do acts not recognisedby scripture, I shall, renouncing good, have to reap onlyevil. Then what man possessed of consciousness andcapable of discriminating between right and wrong, shallhonor me, given to wicked ways and deserving of universalreprehension? Whose is this course (that thou askest meto follow)? And by what way shall I attain heaven, byfollowing the present course, which would make me giveup my vow? When I have (first) myself set up desire as mystandard of action, the entire body of the people shall followme: subjects take to the ways that have been adopted bytheir sovereigns. This eternal regal morality founded inkindness towards the subjects, is verily true. Hence akingdom is essentially based upon truth; and this worlditself is established in truth. Saints and celestials for certainregard truth alone. In this world a truthful person attainsthe regions of Brahmā. Untruthful persons harass peopleas much as serpents. In this world virtue, which is said tobe the root of everything, is itself established in truth. Inthis world, truth is the Lord; in truth is establishedrighteousness. Everything hath truth for its basis. No conditionis superior to truth. The Veda, which inculcates gift,sacrifice, homa, and asceticism, is based on truth. One protectsmen, another his family; one is plunged in hell,—anotheris honored in heaven. Why should I not then obey themandate of my father? My father was of truthful promiseand of righteous ways; and with the object of observinghis promise, he laid on me this (for faithful performance).Having promised to my superior with an oath, I shall neverthrough covetuousness or forgetfulness or pride rive thebridge of truth. We have heard that the gods and the Pitrisdo not accept offerings from one inclined to untruth, or who isunsteady and of volatile faculties. This duty of maintainingtruth, whose influence radiates all over one's soul, I certainlyfind to be the prime one; and this burthen hath (ere this)been borne by worthy people. And it is for this that Ireverence the same. I abjure that Kshatriya morality which,wearing the garb of righteousness, is in fact impiety, andwhich is pursued by the low-minded, or the wicked, or thecovetuous, or the sinful. A person commits a sin by meansof his physique, but after he hath accurately cast it in hismind; and he hath also spoken an untruth with his tongue.Thus a sin is threefold. The earth and fame and renownand auspiciousness pay court unto the truthful person. Thegood follow truth,—therefore even truth is to be sought (byall). Therefore the seemingly excellent thing that thou, afterhaving well ascertained it, hast said unto me in wordsinformed with reason—'Thou hadst rather do this'—appears to mewanting in nobility. How, after having promised unto mysuperior this exile of mine, shall I act up to Bharata's words,setting aside those of my superior? I having remained firmin the promise I had made unto my superior, that noblelady, Kaikeyi, became excceedingly delighted. Living in theforest, pure, with regulated fare, I shall, propitiating the godsand the Pitris with fruits, flowers and roots, (fulfil my vow).Satisfying the five classes,192 I shall, retaining my simplicityand my religious faith, and being able to distinguish betweenright and wrong, pass away the term (of banishment). Havingcome to this scene of action, one should do that which isproper. Even Agni and Vāyu and Soma reap the fruits oftheir own acts. Having acquired the appellation ofSatakratu, the sovereign of the celestials hath gone to heaven;and, having performed rigid austerities, the Maharshis haveattained the celestial regions.\" Having heard of the reasonscouched in that atheistical speech which he could not allowto pass without stricture, that one of fierce energy, the king'sson, censuring what Jāvāli had said, again spoke, \"Truth,righteousness, prowess, kindness to creatures, fairspokenness, and worship of the twice-born ones, gods and guests,these have by the pious been styled the ways to heaven.Having duly heard that these are capable of conferring thesummum bonum, and also come to the same conclusionby reasoning, Vipras, adequately and competely observingmorality with the utmost care, are eagerly desirous ofattaining those regions. I blame this act of my father's, viz.—that he took (for his priest) one of perverse understanding,who rangeth by help of such an intellect—who is frightfullyatheistic, and who hath swerved from the path ofrighteousness. As a thief is, so is a Buddha, and know that in thismatter, an atheist is in a like predicament. Therefore, suchan one, when capable of being punished like a thief for thegood of the people, should be punished like a thief; andlet no Brahmāna ever speak with an atheist. OtherBrāhmanas than thyself, superior to thee, have,serving this world as well as the next, performed variousexellent acts. Therefore those Brahmānas, amen, who havespared life and in other ways practised morality, and havealso given away in charity, performed austerities and servedothers, (perform sacrifices in consonance with Vedas). Andprincipal ascetics engaged in religion, surrounded by thegood, possessed of energy, having charity for their foremostattribute, void of envy, and their hearts free from all stain,—are honored in this world.\" When the magnanimous Rāmaof undiminished strength had wrathfully said this, thatVipra with supplications again spoke words fraught withmorality and high spiritual truth. I do not speak the languageof atheists; nor am I an atheist; nor yet is it true that thereis nothing (hereafter). On the occasion of things havingreference to the next world being performed, I am again abeliever; and on the occasion of things' connection withthis world being taken in hand, I am an atheist once again.O Rāma, the time has gradually drawn nigh when for thepurpose of making thee turn back, it is necessary that Ishould speak the language of atheism. But pacifying thee,I have (again) spoken this (i.e. I am a believer)."

Anxious of making thee turn back,he had spoken thus. Do thou now, O lord of the world,learn the genesis of creatures from me. Water waseverywhere. The earth was constructed therein. Then sprangthe self-create Brāhma along with all the celestials. Havingbecome a boar, he raised up the earth, and along with hissons of subdued souls created everything. Brahmā eternal,existing through all time and incapable of decay, sprangfrom the sky. From him Marichi came into being, andKaçyapa is Marichi's son. Vivaswat drew his birth fromKaçyapa, and Manu from Vivaswat. Manu was formerlyknown as Prajāpati. Ikshwāku is son unto Manu; and thisworld was first conferred upon Ikshwāku by Manu. Dothou know Ikshwāku as the first king in Ayodhyā. Thegraceful Kukshi is known as the son of Ikshwāku. And,O hero, Kukshi's son was Vikukshi. Vikukshi had thepowerful Vāna possessed of exceeding energy for his son.Vāna had the mighty-armed Anaranya of high austeritiesfor his son. During the time of that foremost of righteouspersons, the monarch Anaranya, drouth or famine did notoccur (in Ayodhyā); nor were there any thieves at that time.O mighty king, from Anaranya sprang king Prithu. FromPrithu sprang Trisanku of mighty energy. This hero byvirtue of his truth telling went to heaven in person.Trisanku had the famous Dhundumāra for his son; and fromDhundumāra Juvanāsya was born. Juvanāsya's son was thehandsome Māndhata; and from Māndhāta Susandhi cameinto being. Susandhi had two sons; Dhruvasandhi andPrasenajit. Dhruvasandhi had the illustrious Bharata,destroyer of foes (for his son) From Bharata sprang Asita—towhom sprang these hostile kings as foes, Harhayas,Tālajanghas and Sasavindus—heroes all. Having engaged with themin battle, the king was excited (by them). And on theromantic Himavat, he became engaged in asceticism. It is saidthat at the time, his two wives were gone with child. Thereone of the exalted ladies having eyes resembling lotus petalssaluted Bhrigu's son furnished with the splendour of a celestial,desirous of having an excellent son. Another administeredpoison unto the other for destroying her foetus. Bhrigu'sson named Chyavana was at that time staying in Himavat.Appearing before the sage, Kālindi saluted him. Thereuponhe returned the greeting that had been made by that ladyanxious to secure a boon for the birth of a son. \"Thou,shalt, O lady get a son of mighty soul, who shall be celebratedamong men; and who shall be pious and powerful—theperpetuator of his race and destroyer of enemies\" Hearingthis, that noble lady having gone round him and paid inrespect unto the ascetic went to her home and gave birth toa son furnished with eyes resembling lotus-petals, andof sheen like that of the inside of a lotus. And becauseher co wife, had given her poison for destroying her foetus,and as in consequence of this, he had come in contact withpoison, he came to be called Sagara. The name of thatking is Sāgara, who having been initiated in a sacrificeexcavated the ocean, frightening the people with thevehemence of his operations. Asamanja is known tohave been the son of Sāgara. This wicked man whileyet in life, was banished by his father. Asamanja's sonwas the puissant Ançumat. Dilipa is the son of Ançumatand Dilipa's son is Bhagirtha. From Bhagiratha sprangKākustha; from whom the Kākusthas came to be wellknown. Kākutstha had Raghu for his son; after whomhave been named the Rāghavas. Raghu's son is theenergetic Pravirda, who ate human beings. He is known onearth under such names as Kalmāshapāda, Saudāsa. Wehave heard that Kalmāshapāda's son was Sankhana, whohaving been endowed with prowess, found destructionalong with his forces. Sankhana's son was the beautifuland heroic Sudarçana. Sudarçana's son was Agnivarnaand Agnivarna's, Sighraga; Sighraga's son was Maru, andMaru's Praçuçruva's. Praçuçruva's son was themagnanimous Amvarisha. Amvarisha's son was Nahusha having truthfor his prowess. Nahusha's son was the exceedinglyVirtuous Nābhāga. Nābhāga had two sons,—Aja andSuvrata. Aja's son was the virtuous king Daçarātha. Hiseldest son art thou celebrated under the name of Rāma. Dothou receive thy own kingdom and look after the world.Among the Ikshwākus, the first born becomes the sovereign.The first born existing, an inferior son cannot be installedin the kingdom.

But if he must dwell here, and thus act out themandate of our father, I also will abide in the forest forfourteen years.\" Astonished at the determination of Bharata,the righteous Rāma eying the citizens and the inhabitantsof the provinces, said, \"Neither Bharata nor I can anual anysale or pledge or purchase effected by our father during hislife. Therefore I ought not to accept any substitute for livingin the woods, who can but contribute to my censure.Kaikeyi hath spoken what is proper; and my father hath actedwell.

And there doth not breathearound the aroma of liquor, or the perfume of garlands, orthe incense of aguru and sandal. And on Rāma beingbanished, in this city is not heard the mild neighing of steeds, therattle of vehicles, the roar of mad elephants, or the mightyclatter of arms. And on Rāma having repaired to theforest, youthful folk stricken with sorrow do not enjoy theincense of aguru and sandal, or costly fresh chaplets. Andpersons bearing variegated garlands do not walk abroad;and no festivities are celebrated in the city stricken withgrief on account of Rāma. Surely, the grace of the city hathgone away with my brother. Surely, that Ayodhyā doth notlook beautiful like an autumnal night with showers pouringdown. When shall my brother, coming hither like a carnival,gladden all hearts in Ayodhyā like rain in summer? And thehighways shall be graced with young people elegantlyattired and bearing themselves bravely in Ayodhyā.\" Havingsaid this in grief, Bharata in company with the charioteerentered Ayodhyā and immediately went to the residenceof his father, bereft of that foremost of men, like a cavernbereft of its lion. Seeing the inner apartment shorn of itssplendour, like a day deprived of the sun, mourned by thedeities, and everywhere unclean, the self-possessed Bharata,mowed by grief, began to drop tears."

ThereI shall suffer all this grief on account of Rāma's absence.The king hath gone to heaven, and my superior is stayingin the woods. I shall remain in expectation of Rāma,assuming the reins of government. Verily that illustrious oneis the king.\" Hearing this excellent speech of the high-souled Bharata, the counsellors as well as the priest Vasishthasaid, \"What, O Bharata, influenced by affection for thybrother thou sayst, is worthy of thee and is highlycommendable. Who will not endorse what hath fallen from thee,ever engaged in serving thy friends, established in fraternallove, and who hast entered upon a noble course?\" Havingheard the words of the counsellors acceptable and welcome,Bharata said unto the charioteer, \"Do thou yoke my car.\"Then with a cheerful countenance having spoken to hismothers, that graceful one ascended the car in companywith Satrughna. Having swiftly ascended the car, bothSatrughna and Bharata, right glad at heart, set out, surroundedby counsellors and priests. And going ahead, all thepreceptors headed by Vasishtha proceeded eastwards, in whichdirection lay Nandigrāma. And the forces, filled withelephants and horses and cars, although not called, set out onBharata proceeding, as well as all the citizens. Andascending the car, the virtuous Bharata attached unto his brother,speedily went to Nandigrāma, holding the sandals (of Rāma)on his head. Then entering Nandigrāma in a short time,Bharata swiftly alighted from the car and addressed hispreceptors, saying, \"This monarchy hath been consignedunto me as a trust; and these gold-decked sandals shallcarry on the work of government, protecting what thepeople have and securing unto them what they have not.\"Then bowing unto the sandals which represented the trust,Bharata burning in grief addressed the entire body of thesubjects, saying, \"Do ye speedily hold the umbrella (overthese sandals). These represent the dear feet of the exaltedone. Through these sandals of my superior, will beestablished the regal morality (of the kingdom). This kingdomfrom love hath been conferred on me as a trust; thereforeI shall govern it until Rāghava comes. Again speedilyputting these sandals on Rāghava's feet, I shall beholdthem with the sandals on. On Rāghava coming (back), Ishall, my burden being cast upon him, making over thekingdom unto him, engage myself in serving my superior.And having rendered unto Rāghava the trust in the shapeof these sandals, this kingdom, and Ayodhyā, I shall bewashed from my sin.\" Henceforth wearing bark andmatted locks, and in the guise of an ascetic, the heroicBharata dwelt in Nandigrāma along with his forces. Havingconsigned all rule unto the sandals, Bharata himself heldthe umbrella and the chowri furnished with hair. And thegraceful Bharata, having installed the sandals of the nobleone, always carried on the government in subordinationto them."

And those asceticsthat were living happily in the asylum in Chitrakuta,relying upon Rāma (for their protection), he found to bewrought up with anxiety. And by means of signs by theeye and contractions of the brow, they, afflicted with fear,were, alluding to Rāma, slowly speaking to each other.Perceiving their anxiety, Rāma apprehensive of himself, withjoined hands addressed the patriarchal ascetic, saying, \"0reverned one, do ye find me deviating from the path offormer sovereigns, or acting contrary to their practice,—which hath perplexed (the minds of) these ascetics? Have thesages seen my younger (brother), the high-souled Lakshmana,do anything from inadvertance that is unworthy of him? Dothnot Sitā engaged in serving you, having to serve me, nowminister unto you as a woman should?\" Thereat a certainaged and decrepit ascetic, with his frame trembling, saidupto Rāma ever kind towards creatures, \"Where is thefalling-off of that one of excellent character, engaged inoffices of beneficence,—more specially with reference toascetics? This fear arising from Rākshasas afflicts the asceticsbecause of thee and they, extremely agitated, conversewith each other (on the subject). A Rākshasa named Khara,a younger brother of Rāvana, hath been harassing the asceticsdwelling in Janasthāna. And Dhrishta also a fearless andwicked Rākshasa feeding on human beings,—and theunrighteous Avalipta, cannot bear thee, my child. As long, mychild, as thou hast been residing in this asylum, theRākshasas have been plaguing the ascetics. And they showthemselves sometimes in disgusting shapes, sometimes inhorrible and dreadful ones,—in various frightful forms capableof frightening folks. And they throw execrable and uncleanthings among the anchorets, and torment those that happento come before them. And they take delight in approachingasylums unperceived, and slaughtering ascetics, afterhaving bound them by means of their arms. And on theoccasion of sacrifices, they throw away the vesselscontaining sacrificial articles, pour water on the sacrificial fire andbreak vessels containing water. Eager to renounce thisasylum infested by those wicked ones, and removing toanother place, the sages today have been exhorting me (onthe subject). And, O Rāma, ere this, those wicked oneshave slain ascetics. Therefore we would renounce thisasylum. Not far from here is a picturesque wood aboundingin fruits and roots. Thither shall I betake myself togetherwith my own folks. Khara shall also annoy thee. If thouthink it proper, go hence in company with us. O Rāghava,although thou art vigilant, able, and in all ways capable,it would be unpleasant for thee to dwell here now in doubt.\""

Then having paid homage unto Rāma,and spoken to him and encouraged Rāghava, the patriachascetic renouncing the asylum, went away along with his ownpeople. And Rāma having (for a time) followed the sagewho was departing from that place, and having paid himrespects, being permitted by them, well-pleased, and advised(as to what it behoved him to do), came to his quartersreposing there. (Thenceforth) Rāghava never for a moment leftthat asylum forsaken by the sages.—Rāghava having suchqualities in his character as were likely to stand the sagesin stead, the ascetics (that remained behind) ever followedRāghava."

And in consequence of the troops of that high-souled one having quartered here as well as the dungdischarged by his elephants and horses, this place has gotexceedingly dirty. Therefore will I go to another quarter.\"Having settled this in his mind, Rāghava departed alongwith Videha's daughter and Lakshmana. And havingarrived at Atri's asylum, that renowned one paid obeisance (untothe sage); and the reverend Atri also on his part receivedRāma as a son. And having personally given Rāmarespectful reception and entertainment, the ascetic regarded theexalted Lakshmana and Sitā with a gracious eye. And his agedwife having come there, Atri greeted her; and after shehad been paid homage, the sage cognizant of virtue everengaged in the good of all creatures, gladdened her (bypresenting Sitā unto her.) And that best of sages said unto thepious fetnale ascetic, Anasuyā, engaged in offices of virtue, \"Dothou accept Videha's daughter.\" And Atri related untoRāma matters connected with the female ascetic, engaged inoffices of virtue, \"The people were ceaselessly burning inconsequence of a drouth extending over ten years. O sinlessone, that one resembling thy mother is this, by whomfurnished with rigid asceticsim and adorned with voluntarypenances, were created fruits and roots and the Jāhnavi was madeto flow through the asylum; by whom were performed mightyausterities for ten thousand years,—in virtue of whosepenances, disturbances to the asceticism of the sages ceased,—by whom ten nights were brought within the compass of asingle one. Let Vaidehi always resort to this aged asceticdevoid of anger, who is worthy of being bowed down to byall creatures.\" When the saint had spoken thus, Rāghavasaying, \"So be it,\" turned his eyes to Sitā, and thus spokeunto that one knowing morality, \"O princess, thou hastheard what hath been uttered by the ascetic. For the sakeof thy own welfare, do thou speedily resort to the femaleanchoret. Do thou without delay resort unto the asceticAnasuyā, who is worthy of being associated with, and who hathby virtue of her acts attained renown among men.\" Hearingthese words of Rāghava, Mithila's daughter, the illustriousSitā, drew near the righteous wife of Atri. Thereupon Sitā,announcing her name, saluted the pious and chaste Anasuyā,old, with slackened joints, with folds all over her skin, andher hair hoary from age, whose frame shook perpetually, likea plantain-leaf in the wind. Having paid homage unto thatascetic with her senses subdued, Vaidehi glad at heart, withjoined hands, enquired after her welfare. Seeing the virtuousSitā engaged in righteous acts, the old lady consoling her,said \"By luck it is that thou regardest righteousness. O Sitā,having left thy kindred, and banishing pride, thou hast, Ohonored lady, followed Rāma staying in the woods. Theythat love their husbands, whether living in the city or theforest, whether well or ill disposed towards them, attain greatstate. Wicked, or libidinous, or indigent, a husband isa supreme deity unto a wife of noble character. Thanthe husband a greater friend find I none, O Vaidehi, whois worthy of being served both in this world and thenext, and who is like imperishable asceticism. But badwomen whose hearts hunger after carnality, and wholord over their husbands, do not get acquainted withthe virtues and demerits (of their husbands); and range attheir will. Mithila's daughter, surely women of this sortwho are given to doing evil acts, reap infamy and fall off fromrighteousness. But worthy women like thee furnished withexcellences, see a superior and better world, and range thecelestial regions, like pious people. Therefore followingthis one, and adopting the course of chaste women, do thouprove the associate in virtue of thy husband,—and then shaltthou attain both fame and religious merit.\""

  "Bālakāndam and Ayodhyākāndam": "Thus addressed by Anasuyā, Vaidehi devoid of malice,honoring her words, began, \"That thou shouldst instruct meis no wonder in thee. I know that a woman's spiritualguide is her husband. Even if a husband should be poorand of a disreputable character, he should be ungrudginglyobeyed by the like of me. And to be said of one thatis crowned with qualities, kind, self-controlled, of steadyaffection, righteous-souled, and who is dear as a father ora mother? The exceedingly strong Rāma beareth himselftowards the other wives of the monarch as he doth towardsKauçalyā herself. Renouncing sense of self-importance,that heroic one conversant with righteousness, devoted tohis king, regardeth as his mothers those on whom themonarch once cast his eyes. What my mother-in-lawinstructed me at the time that I was leaving for the lonely andfearful forest, is constantly present in my mind. And whatalso my mother taught me in presence of fire on the occasionof the bestowal of my hand, is also remembered by me.And, O thou engaged in acts of righteousness, I have notforgotten the words that my relatives said unto me, viz, theasceticism of a woman is ministering unto her husband.They did not teach any thing else. Having served her lord,Sāvitri is highly honored in heaven; and thou also,following the same course, by virtue of having served thy husband,hath secured heaven. And this foremost of females, thisgoddess of heaven, Rohini, is not seen for a momentwithout the moon. And prime women of this sort, firm in theirhusbands, are highly respected in the celestial regions byvirtue of their pious acts.\" Hearing Sitā's words, Anasuyā,exceedingly delighted, smelling her head, spoke thus,pleasing Maithili, \"By observing restrictions, I have earned greatasceticism. By resorting to that energy, I would, O Sitā,confer a boon upon thee, O thou of pure vows. O Maithili,thy words are just and proper. I am well pleased (withthee). Tell me, O Sitā, what good shall I do thee?\"Hearing her words, Sitā, surprized, said with a smile, unto thatlady equipped with ascetic strength, \"All this hath beendone by thee.\" Thus accosted, that one cognizant of virtue,was still more pleased, and said, \"I am exceedingly pleased(with thy words). I will attain a desire of mine. This nobleand grand garland, this apparel, these ornaments, and thisprecious paste for adorning the person, presented by me—let these, O Sitā, grace thy person. These, worthy of theewill never be tarnished. O daughter of Janaka, daubingthy person with this excellent paint, thou wilt grace thyhusband even as Sree doth the undeteriorating Vishnu.\"Thereupon Mithilā's daughter accepted those thingspresented unto her out of love, viz., the apparel, the paint, theornaments and the garland. Having accepted those presentsconferred on her from love, that illustrious one, Sitā, quietlysat beside the female ascetic with joined hands. Then asSitā was sitting, Anasuyā firm in vow asked her concerninga thing that was near her heart, saying, \"I have heard, O Sitā,that thou wert won by the renowned Rāghava on theoccasion of a self-choice. O Maithili, that story I should like tohear, related at length. It therefore behoves thee torelate that unto me in detail.\" Thus addressed, Sitā, sayingunto the ascetic engaged in pious acts, \"Listen!\" beganto tell the story. \"Mithilā's lord, the heroic Janaka, justlyruleth the earth, engaged in observing the duties ofKshatriyas. As he was ploughing a plain intended for a sacrifice, Irose from under the earth; and (in this sense) I am thedaughter of that king. Tending me, with my body coveredwith dust, Janaka, engaged in throwing handfuls of dust(to level hollow spots), was struck with amazement.Being childless, he took me on his lap from affection, andsaying—'This is my daughter', conceived affection for me.Then there were uttered words in the welkin, resemblingthose of a human being,—'O king, in all righteousness, this isthy daughter.' Then well-pleased, my righteous father,the king,lord of Mithilā, receiving me, attained mighty good fortune.Consigned unto the pious eldest noble one (queen), desirousof having offspring, I was brought up by that mild lady, withthe tenderness of a mother. (In time) seeing me fit for thecompany of a husband, my father in distress was plunged inthought, like a poor man that hath lost his wealth. Evenif the father of a girl be like unto Sakra himself on earth,he reapeth odium at the hands of his equals and inferiors.Perceiving this obloquy at a short distance, the king wasplunged in a sea of anxiety, but could not cross it, like onethat hath no raft. Knowing me as unborn from any femalevessel, the lord of earth reflecting upon it, could not comeupon a suitable and fit husband for me. Then as he reflected,this thought occurred to him 'I will righteouslycelebrate the self-choice of my daughters'. In the great sacrificeof Daksha, the high-souled Varuna had well-pleased conferredon Devarāta an excellent bow with inexhaustible arrowsand a couple of quivers. Incapable of being moved onaccount of its weight, the kings could not even dream ofbending the bow. Having obtained the bow, my truthful fathersaid, 'No fear!' inviting at the same time the kings to anassembly of sovereigns. 'He that, raising the bow, shallstring it, shall doubtless receive my daughter for his wife.'Seeing that best of bows in weight resembling a hill, thekings saluting it, go away, unable to move it. And it cameto pass that after a long time, this highly effulgent Rāghavacame to witness the sacrifice in company with Viçwāmitra.And Rāma having truth for his prowess, and the righteousViçwāmitra were respectfully received by my sire. ThenViçwāmitra said unto my father, 'The descendants of Raghu,sons of Daçarātha, Rāma and Lakshmana, are anxious tobehold the bow.' Thus accosted by the Vipra, my fatherbrought the bow, and showed that celestial bow unto theprinces. Thereupon, in the twinkling of an eye, bending it,the powerful (Rāghava) stringed the bow and drew it. Andis he drew it vehemently, it broke in the middle in twain.And the sound of it was dreadful like unto the bursting ofa thunder-bolt. Then raising an excellent vessel of water,my truthful father prepared to bestow me on Rāghava. Andbestowed on Rāghava, I was accepted of him, after he hadconsulted the wish of his father, that lord, the master ofAyodhyā. And inviting my father-in-law, the old kingDaçarātha, my father bestowed me on Rāma, having aknowledge of self. And my father bestowed on Lakshmanafor his wife, my younger sister, the beauteous and chasteUrmilā. Thus was I bestowed on Rāma on the occasionof that self-choice. And ever since I have been devotedunto my husband, the foremost of those possessing prowess.\""

O sweet-speechedone, I have been delighted with thy narration.But ushering in the auspicious night, the graceful Sunhath set. And there are heard the notes of featheredones, which, after having gone about in search of foodare resting now for the purpose of sleeping. And theseascetics having bathed, are wending their way in abody, carrying water-pitchers, their barks drenched withwater. And the smoke arising from the fire-sacrifice dulyperformed by the ascetics,—reddish like the hue of thepigeon's neck, is seen, wafted by the wind. And trees ofspare foliage appear dense (on all sides); and distance isno longer perceptible. And animals ranging in the nightare going about all round; and those deer of the asylumare reposing on the daises. O Sitā, the night crested bythe stars hath arrived; and, veiled in moonlight, appeareththe moon in the heavens. Go thou; I permit thee. Do thouseek the society of Rāma. I have been pleased with thysweet converse. And, O daughter of Mithilā, do thou deckthyself before me. Do thou thus please me, my child, thouthat lookest beautiful with excellent ornaments.\" Thereat,having adorned herself, Sitā, resembling the daughter of acelestial, bowing down to the feet (of the female ascetic),directed her steps towards Rāma. And that best ofspeakers, Rāghava, saw Sitā, decked with the ornamentsaffectionately presented by the ascetic; and he rejoiced thereat.Then Mithilā's daughter, Sitā, related unto Rāma all abouther having been affectionately presented by the asceticwith attire, ornaments and the garland. Thereupon,witnessing the honor that had been accorded unto Maithili,—rare among men, Rāma became well pleased,—as also thatmighty car-warrior, Lakshmana. Then Raghu's son,ministered unto by the ascetic, happily spent the delightful nightthere, with her face resembling the moon. On the nighthaving passed away, those foremost of men, after performingtheir ablutions, enquired of the ascetics performingfire-sacrifices, who lived in the forest. Thereat the righteousascetics ranging the forest said that all the sides of the forestwere infested by Rākshasas. \"Ferocious beasts feastingon blood, and Rākshasas, O Rāghava, living on humanbeings,—wearing various shapes, abide in this mighty forest.These eat up ascetics leading the Brahmācharya mode oflife, who happen to be unclean or heedless. Do thou,therefore, O Rāghava, let them. This is the path of the Maharshis,who procure fruits in the forest. By this way thou wilt beable to enter the impracticable wild, O Rāghava.\" Thusaddressed by the ascetic twice-born ones, and having beenblessed by them, that repressor of foes, Rāghava, enteredthe forest in company with his wife and Lakshmana, likethe sun entering a mass of clouds."

  "Column2": "Here the commentators differ in fixing the age of Rāma at the time of his going to the forest. Rāma's age was under sixteen at the time of marriage, and after he was married to Sica he enjoyed her company for twelve years, when the proposal of installation was made. This makes totally an age of twenty-seven. In the text 'dasa saptacha' (ten and seven) ten years fall short which are to be made up by taking into account the age of ten being left out, preceding Rāma's entering into the second birth which begins at maunji-bandhana or initiation into the mysteries of the Vedic literature. Following the example of Bhashyakara Patanjali, the commentator, Rāmanuju has in the sentence 'dasa saptacha' supplied another (dasa) (ten) by means of ellipsis, thus giving an age of twenty-seven. This, however, contradicts the statement of Sitā to Rāvana in guise of an anchorite, informing him of the age of her husband being twenty-five. A modern annotator with great ingenuity has devised ways to make up this discrepancy. The age of Rāma was under sixteen, when Visvamitra asked his assistance in destroying Tārakā. 'Under sixteen' may mean fifteen or twelve as well. After marriage at twelve, Rāma enjoyed twelve years more the pleasure of home. This giving in total twenty-four, it is to be supposed that when he was exiled he stepped at twenty-five. The text 'dasa saptacha' is correct, considering the age of eight being left out preceding his second birth at the initiation into the mysteries of the Veda."

The typesetters of the original bookrepresented the letter ā (with a macron above) as â (with circumflex above) whenitalicized, but this etext uses the macron throughout. Words in italicsin this etext were italicized in the original book. I have corrected obviousmisspellings but I've left variant spellings alone. Some words and names,like yojana and Garuda, were spelled two different ways in the same text.I have spelled them consistently to avoid confusion."

Beholding thatcollection of asylums belonging unto the ascetics, resemblingthe regions of Brahmā, resonant with the voices of Vedicrecitations; and grateful; with highly pious Brāhmanasversed in the Vedas,—the exceedingly energetic and gracefulRāghava entered the same, having first unstrung hismighty bow. Thereupon, seeing the righteous Rāmaresembling the moon risen, as well as Lakshmana and the illustriousVaidehi, those Maharshis endeued with spiritualintuition, came forward (to meet the incomers); and, havinguttered benedictions, those persons of rigid vows, receivedthem. And those dwellers of the wood, struck with wonder,beheld Rāma's tender grace and lovliness and eleganceof dress. And struck with astonishment, those inhabitantsof the woods of pre-eminent piety saw Vaidehi,Lakshmana and Rāma, with winkless eyes. And those personsof exalted virtue, engaged in the welfare of all creatures,made Rāghava, their guest, sit down in their thatched cottage.Then, having received Rāma respectfully according toscriptural prescription, those virtuous ones of eminent piety,resembling fire, procured water (for Rāma). And, experiencinggreat delight, those high-souled ones, uttering benedictions,procured wild fruits, flowers and roots; and, having assignedan asylum (unto Rāma), those persons cognizant ofrighteousness, said with joined hands, \"Possessed of high fame, thou,the protector of righteousness, art the refuge of thesepeople. Thou shoudst be honored and worshipped, beingtheir king, holding the rod, and their superior. O Rāghava, itis because he that governs his subjects, is a fourth part of Indrahimself, that the king, being bowed down unto by all,enjoys the choicest things. And we, being in thy dominions,ought to be protected by thee. Whether living in the cityor in the woods, thou, lord of men, art our sovereign. Wehave renounced chastising others; and, O monarch, we haveconquered our anger, and subdued our passions. Therefore,even as a child in its mother's womb (should be protectedby her), should we be protected by thee.\" Having said this,they entertained Rāghava, along with Lakshmana, withfruits and roots and flowers and diverse other ediblesprocurable in the woods. In the same way, other ascetics ofaccomplished purposes, living lives of integrity, duly pleasedthat lord, Rāma, resembling Vaiçyānara."

  "Āranya, Kishkindhā, and Sundara Kāndam": "Having received the homage of the ascetics, Rāmaabout sun-rise, having greeted them all, entered into theforest. And Rāma, followed by Lakshmana, saw the heartof the forest abounding in various kinds of beasts,—ranged bybears and tigers, with its trees and shrubs torn and trampled,its pools turbid, and its birds crying. And, having in companywith Sitā arrived at that forest abounding in terrible beasts,Kākutstha saw a man-eater, resembling a mountain-summit,emitting tremendous roars, with hollow eyes, a huge face,frightful, having a deformed belly, disgusting, dreadful,Cyclopean, mis-shapen, of a horrible sight, clad in a tiger-skin,besmeared with fat, covered with blood, capable offrightening all creatures, with his mouth widely extended, like untothe Destroyer himself, and uttering loud shouts,—who stoodpiercing with his iron dart three lions, four tigers, twoleopards, four Prishatas, and the huge tusked head of an elephantdripping fat. Having seen Rāma and Lakshmana, as well asSitā the daughter of Mithilā, he growing angry, rushed(against them), like the Destroyer himself rushing againstcreatures at the universal dissolution. Uttering a dreadfulyell, and, as if making the earth tremble, he took Vaidehion his waist, and, going a little distance, said, \"O ye wearingbark and matted locks, O ye of feeble strength, thataccompanied by your (common) wife, have entered the forest ofDandaka, bearing bows and arrows and scimitars, why, beingascetics, do ye wish to associate with a (single) woman? Yewicked wretches, ye impious wights, who are ye that bringdisgrace upon ascetics? I am a Rākshasa, Virādha by name.This forest is my fastness. Accoutred in arms, I range(here), feeding on the flesh of ascetics. This transcendentallybeauteous one shall be my wife. And in battle I shalldrink your blood, wretches that ye are.\" Hearing thewicked and vaunting speech of the impious Virādha, as hesaid this, Janaka's daughter, Sitā, began to tremble fromfear, like a plantain tree shaken by the wind. Seeing thegraceful Sitā on the waist of Virādha, Rāghava with a blankcountenance said unto Lakshmana, \"O amiable one, behold thedaughter of king Janaka, my wife of pure ways, an illustriousprincess brought up in luxury—on Virādha's waist OLakshmana, what had been wished for by Kaikeyi withreference to us, (hath taken place), and the dear boon (thatshe had asked) hath born fruit. That far-sighted lady—mysecond mother—who had not been satisfied with havingsecured the kingdom in the interests of her son, and by whomI that was dear unto her above all other creatures, had beenbanished to the woods, hath to-day her wishes crownedwith success. O Sumitra's son, nothing can impart unto megreater anguish than the touching of Vaidehi by another—which surpasses my father's demise and my having beendeprived of the kingdom.\" As Kākutstha with his eyesflooded with tears was speaking thus, Lakshmana flying intoa rage, spoke like unto a confined elephant: \"Why dost thou,O Kākutstha, being the lord of all creatures and resemblingVasava himself,—and also backed by myself, thy servant,—grieve like one forlorn? The earth shall drink the goreof this Rākshasa, Virādha, when deprived of life, after hehath been slain with a shaft by my angry self. That ire ofmine which I had conceived against Bharata hankering after thekingdom, will I discharge on Virādha; even as the weilder ofthe thunder holt hurls his weapon at a hill. Let my mightyarrow acquiring velocity from the speed imparted to itthrough the energy of my arms, light on his huge breast,and force his life from forth his body; and let him whirling(at length fall down to the earth)."

  "Āranya, Kishkindhā, and Sundara Kāndam": "Then Virādha again spoke filling the forest, “Do ye tellme who ask you,—who are ye and whither are ye going?\"Thereupon, the highly energetic Rāma answered theRākshasa with a flaming face, when he had thus asked (Rāma)—that he belonged to the Ikshwāku race. “Know us thatare in ihe forest, for Kshatriyas of respectable character.I also am anxious of knowing who thou art, that goestabout the Dandakas.\" Virādha answered Rāma havingtruth for his prowess, \"Ah! I will tell thee, O king. Dothou, O Rāghava understand! I am son unto Java, andmy mother is Satarhadā. All the Rākshasas of the earthhave called me Virādha. Having gratified Brahmā by myasceticism, I received (this boon) that none in the worldwould be able lo slay me by mangling my body withweapons. Forsaking this fair one, do ye renouncing all hope(of either recovering her or vanquishing me), speedily fleeaway to that place whence ye had come;—else I shall depriveyou of your lives.\" Thereat, Rāma with his eyes reddenedthrough wrath replied unto that Rākshasa of a deformedshape, the wicked Virādha—saying, “Little! shame on theeof base purposes! Thou surely seekest thy own death; and(death) thou shall get in battle. Stay! Thou escapestme not with life.\" Then stringing his bow, Rāma,speedily aiming at the Rākshasa, pierced him with sharpenedshafts; and (then) from his bow-string let go seven shafts,having their feathered parts plaited with gold, furnishedwith great velocity, and coursing like Suparna or thewind. Thereat, resembling flames, those arrows furnishedwith peacocks' feathers, pierced Virādha's body, and fell tothe earth, covered with blood. On being thus pierced, theRākshasa set Vaidehi down, and, upraising a dart, rushed inwrath towards Rāma and Lakshmana. And sending forth amighty roar, he took up a dart resembling the banner ofSakra; and he then appeared like the Destroyer3 withopening mouth. Then the brothers showered a blazing volley ofshafts on the Rākshasa, resembling the Destroyer himself.And stationing himself at a spot, the Rākshasa, laughingterribly, yawned, and as he yawned the flest-coursing shafts felloff from his person. And by virtue of the bestowal of the boon(by Brahmā), the Rākshasa Virādha drew up his vitalenergies, and, lifting up a pike, darted at the descendants ofRaghu. That best of those bearing arms cut off with twoarrows that dart resembling the thunder-bolt and flamingin the sky. And the dart severed by the shafts of Rāma,fell to the earth, as falls a crag severed by the thunderbolt.Thereat, swiftly raising up a sword, resembling a blacksnake, each (of the Rāghavas) approached his antagonist,and began to assail him hastily. Thus hard beset, thatterrible one, seizing them both with his arms, attempted tomake away with those foremost of men, who, however,retained their calmness. Reading his purpose, Rāma spake untoLakshmana, \"Let the Rākshasa bear us by this way.Not use of letting him. Sumatra's son, let the Rākshasa bearus wherever he likes. Even this, by which the ranger of thenight is proceeding, is our way.\" And lifting up (Rāma andLakshmana) by his might and prowess, as if they werestriplings, that haughty ranger of the night laid them onhis shoulders. And having deposited the Rāghavas on hisihoulders, Virādha—ranger4 of night—sending up dreadfulshouts, directed his course towards the forest. And he atlength entered the forest resembling a mighty mass of clouds,furnished with various kinds of trees, picturesque withdiverse species of birds, and abounding in jackals, serpentsand beasts."

Me bears will devour andtigers and panthers. Renouncing the Kākutsthas, do thoucarry me away. I bow unto thee, O best of Rākshasas.\"Hearing these words of Vaidehi, Rāma and Lakshmana bestirredthemselves for compassing the death of that wicked one. AndSumitra's son broke his left arm; while Rāma at once brokethe Rākshasa's right one. On his arms being broken, theRākshasa resembling a mass of clouds, growing weak, sank downon the ground in a swoon, like a hill riven by the thunderbolt.Thereupon, they assailed the Rākshasa with their fists,arms and feet; and lifting him up once and again,and pressing him, they trod on him over the ground.Although he was sore pierced by full many an arrowand cut sorryly by scimitars, and pressed down on the earthin various ways, yet the Rākshasa expired not. Seeing himutterly incapable of being killed, and resembling a hill, thatinspirer of hope in times of peril, the graceful (Rāma), said,\"O foremost of men, in consequence of his austerities, yonRākshasa cannot be vanquished with weapons in conflict.Therefore, let us cast him into a pit. O Lakshmana, dig acapacious pit in this forest6 for this Rākshasa resembling anelephant, terible, and of a grim presence.\" Having said thisunto Lakshmana,—\"Do thou dig a pit,\" the powerful Rāmaremained planting his foot on Virādha's throat. Havingheard Rāghava's words, the Rākshasa spake gently, \"Slainam I, O chief of men, by thee possessed of strength equal tothat of Sakra. Through ignorance, O foremost of men,I could not before know thee. Now I know thee that artRāma, the worthy Son of Kauçalyā, my child; as well as thehighly virtuous Vaidehi and the renowned Lakshmana. Byvirtue of a curse, I entered this dreadful Rākshasi form, I aGandharba, having been cursed by Vaiçravana. Beingpropitiated by me, that greatly famous one said,—'When Rāmathe son of Daçaratha, shall slay thee in encounter, thou,attaining thy natural condition, shalt repair to the celestialregions.' Getting wroth, he cursed me, who had been absent;and thus did king Vaiçravana address me, who had conceivedlove for Rambhā. Through thy grace have I been freed fromthis fearful curse, I shall (now) repair to heaven. Hail, Orepressor of foes! Half a Yoyana hence, my child, dwells therighteous and potent Maharshi, Sarabhanga, resembling theSun. Seek him speedily: he will bring about thy good. Castingme (into this pit) in the wood, do thou, O Rāma, peacefully gothy way. Even this is the eternal usage of the Rākshasas.hose that die in the forest, attain eternal regions.\" Havingsaid this unto Kākutstha, the mighty Virādha, afflicted witharrows, having his body deposited (in the pit), attainedheaven. Having heard that speech of Virādha, Righavaordered Lakshmana, saying, \"O Lakshmana, do thou in this forestdig a capacious pit for this Rākshasa resembling an elephant,dreadful, and of terrible acts.\" Having said untoLakshmana, \"Dig a pit,\"—Rāma possessed of prowess remainedfixing his foot on Virādha' s throat. Then taking a hoe, Lakshmanadug a spacious pit by the side of the huge-bodied7 Virādha.Then when his throat had been freed, (Lakshmana) castinto the pit Virādha having ears resembling javelins, sendingloud and dreadful sounds. Having vanquished him in fight,Rāma and Lakshmana possessed of activity and steady infight, being exceedingly delighted, raising up the dreadfulRākshasa by main force, cast him howling (into the pit).Reflecting that he was incapable of being slain (by sharpenedweapons), those foremost of men, exceedingly well versed (inarms), compassed the death of that mighty Asura, Virādha,in the pit, after they had dug it. Virādha had himselfsincerely wished for his death at the hands of Rāma; and thatranger of the woods had accordingly told (Rāma),—\"Mydeath cannot be effected by means of weapons.\" Havingheard these words, Rāma decided upon casting him into apit. And when the excessively strong Rākshasa entered thecavity, he made the forest resound with his cries. Havingthrown him into the hole, Rāma and Lakshmana, their fearsremoved, appeared with joyful looks, and rejoiced in thatforest like the sun and the moon seated in the heavens.8"

Therefore will we speedily repair to the asceticSarabhanga.\" Thereupon Rāghava set out for the hermitageof Sarabhanga. And Rāma beheld a mighty wonder nearthat one of celestial virtue, who had purified his soul throughasceticism. He saw the lord of the celestials, possessedof a resplendent person, resembling in effulgence the sun orVaicwānara—mounted on a superb car—(saw) him that isfollowed by all the celestials, stationed in the sky, nottouching the earth, adorned in luminous ornaments—the goddressed in a clean apparel; worshipped by many ahigh-souled personage dressed in the same way. And from adistance, (Rāma) saw the car stationed in the sky yoked withgreen steeds—resembling the infant sun; and he saw thespotless umbrella possessing the beauty of a mass of whiteclouds, resembling the lunar disc,—and graced withvariegated wreaths. And his (Indra's) head was being fannedby two chowris, costly and furnished with golden handles,held by two magnificent damsels; and innumerableGandharbas and Siddhas and prime sages were hymning the celestialstationed in the welkin. And seeing Sarabhanga engagedin converse with Satakratu, Rāma said unto Lakshmana (thefollowing words). And pointing out the car, Rāma showedthe wonder unto his brother. \"Behold, O Lakshmana, yondercar stationed in the sky, splendid, furnished with exceedinggrace, wonderful, and seeming as if the sun had fallen fromthe heavens. The steeds standing in the sky are for certainthose of which we had formerly heard as belonging untoSakra of many sacrifices. And, thou foremost of men, theseyouths environing (the celestial) by hundreds, wearingearrings, and bearing swords in their hands, are broad of chest,have arms resembling bludgeons in size,and are clad in crimsonvesture, like unto tigers incapable of being approached. Overthe breasts of all appear chains of blazing sheen; and, O sonof Sumitrā, their beauty appears that of five and twenty. Andeven this is the ever-enduring age of the celestials, as theseforemost of men of sweet looks appear. O Lakshmana, stayhere awhile with Vaidehi, so long as I do not gatherwho it is that is in the effulgent car.\" Saying untoSumitras son, \"Stay here,\" Kākutstha bent his steps towardsSarabhanga's aslylum. And seeing Rāma approach, Sachi'slord, taking Sarabhanga's permission, addressed the celestials,saying, \"Rāma is coming hither. Do ye set out for anotherplace, ere he yet addresses me. He is not fit to beholdme (now.) When he shall have vanquished (his foe in fight),and won success, shall I readily show myself unto him. Heshall have to achieve an act incapable of being achieved byothers.\" Then rendering homage unto that anchoret andconversing with him, the weilder of the thunderbolt—subduerof enemies—repaired to heaven in a car yoked with steeds.When the thousand-eyed one had gone away, Rāghavaaccompanied by his companions appeared before Sarabhangain the Agni-hotra chamber. Taking his feet, Rāma, Sitā andLakshmana sat down with the permission of the ascetic,who received them and set apart quarters for them. ThenRāghava questioned (the sage) concerning the visit of Sakra;and Sarabhanga related everything unto Rāghava. \"O Rāma,this bestower of boons wishes to take me to the regions ofBrahmā. I have conquered them, incapable of being attainedby persons that have not schooled themselves,—by virtue offierce austerities. O chief of men, knowing that thou wertnear, I became anxious to go to the minor celestial regionsand this supreme heaven (of Brahmā), after I had seen thee,righteous and high-souled, who art my dear guest now. Oforemost of men, I have for aye attained the excellent regionsof Brahmā. and Nākaprishtha. Do thou receive them aspertaining to me.\" Thus addressed by the sage, Sarabhanga,that best of men, Rāghava, versed in every branch oflearning, said, \"O mighty anchoret, I shall acquire all thoseregions myself. I now wish that thou mayst direct me asto my abode in this forest.\" Thus accosted by Rāghavaresembling Sakra in strength, the eminently wise Sarabhangaagain said, \"O Rāma, here in this forest lives a pious andself-restrained ascetic of mighty energy, named Sutikshna. Hewill bring about thy good. O Rāma, follow this Mandākiniflowing among flowers, which (here) runs in an oppositedirection to her usual course; and then wilt thou reach there.This is thy course, thou best of men. Do thou now, mychild, for a space look at me; while I leave off my limbs,even as a serpent renounces its slough.\" Then preparinga fire and with Mantras offering oblations into it, theexceedingly energetic Sarabhanga entered into the fire. The fireconsumed the down, hair, old skin, bones, flesh and blood ofthat high-souled one. (Anon) Sarabhanga became a youthresembling fire; and rising from the flame, he appearedsplendid. And proceeding past the regions of high-souledsages sacrificing with fire, as well as of the celestials, heascended those of Brahmā. And that one of pious acts doneon earth—that best of the twice-born race—saw thegrand-father, in company with his followers. And the grand-fatheralso, beholding that Brāhmana, rejoiced greatly, and said,—\"Hail!\""

And coming before Rāma, theforemost of those practising righteousness, those sagesconversant with morality,—met in a body, said unto thatpre-eminently virtuous one, \"A mighty car-warrior, thouart the foremost person of the Ikshwāku race and the world;as well as their lord,—even as Maghavan is the lord of thecelestials. Famous over the three worlds in high worth andprowess, in thee are found truth and virtue in profusion andobedience unto the mandate of thy sire. O lord, it behovesthee cognizant of virtue and attached unto it, to forgive usfor what we as suiters say unto thee. The sin, O lord, ofthat monarch is mighty that taketh a sixth part of thesubjects' incomes, but doth not protect them as sons. Buthe that, setting his heart on protecting the people, doth evercarefully protect all the inhabitants of his dominions, likehis own life or like his son dearer unto him than life itself,reapeth, O Rāma, enduring renown extending over manyyears, and (at length) attaining the regions of Brahmā, isglorified there. The king that protects his subjectsrighteously, is entitled to a fourth part of the great religious meritthat is reaped by an ascetic subsisting on fruits and roots.O Rāma, this many Brāhmanas—this great body of men thathave assumed the Vānaprastha mode of life, although havingthee for their lord, are being sorely troubled by Rākshasas,as if they had none. Come and behold the bodies ofinnumerable ascetics of pure hearts that have in various waysbeen slaughtered by Rākshasas in the forest. And greatis the worry that is experienced by the dwellers on the riverPampi and the Mandākini as well as those that reside inChitrakuta. We cannot bear the terrible affliction of theascetics in the forest at the hands of Rākshasas of dreadfuldeeds. Therefore, for obtaining refuge, have we come beforethee who art the refuge (of all). Do thou, O Rāma, deliverus all, who are being exceedingly afflicted by the rangers ofthe night. O hero, we have no greater refuge on earththan thyself. Do thou, O king's son, rescue us all fromRākshasas.\" Hearing these words of the sages and ascetics,that righteous-souled one addressed them, saying, \"It dothnot behove you to speak thus. I should be commanded bythe anchorets. I have entered the forest solely with a viewto my own purpose. I have entered this forest in obedienceto the mandate of my father, with the object (at the sametime) of putting an end to these ravages of the Rākshasas onyou. I have at my own will come hither for securingyour interest. Then shall my stay in the woods be crownedwith mighty fruit. I wish to slay in battle the enemiesof the ascetics. Let the sages and ascetics behold myprowess as well as that of my brother.\" Having beenconferred a boon by the ascetics, that hero entered upon a nobleundertaking, and accompanied by the ascetics, in companywith Lakshmana directed his course to (the hermitage of)Sutikshna."

Then those worthy scions ofthe Ikshwāku race—descendants of Raghu—with Sitāentered the forest ever furnished with various kinds of trees. Andhaving entered the dense forest abounding in blossoms andfruits and trees, Rāma saw in a recess an asylum glitteringwith bark and garlands.

This asylum now hath been furnished with its masterin consequence of thy visit. O illustrious one, O hero,expecting thee, I have not yet ascended heaven, renouncingon earth this body of mine. I had (already) heard that, comingto Chitrakuta, (thou hadst been staying there), having beendeprived of the kingdom. Here came, O Kākutstha, theSovereign of the celestials of an hundred sacrifices. Comingto me, that mighty deity, the Sovereign of the celestials, saidthat I had acquired all the worlds by my pious acts. Do thou,by my grace, in company with thy wife and Lakshmana, dwelldelightfully in those regions won by my asceticism,containing Devarshis.\" Thereupon the self-possessed Rāmaanswered that blazing and truth-telling Brahmana of fieryausterities, like Vasava answering Brahma, saying, \"Omighty ascetic, I myself will win those regions. I wish tobe directed to a dwelling in this forest. Thou art possessedof ability in respect of everything, and art (at the same time)engaged in the welfare of all beings,—this hath been toldunto me by the high-souled Sarabhanga of the Gautama race.\"Thus addressed by Rāma, that Maharshi known over all theworlds, spoke sweet words ia great joy, \"O meritoriousRāma, even this is the asylum (for thee). Do thou live herepleasantly. It is inhabited by numbers of saints and is alwaysprovided with fruits and roots. This forest is haunted byherds of deer that range here without doing harm to anyone, although they possess great energy; and go away, havingbewitched people (by their beauty). Save what comes fromthese deer, there is no other evil to be encountered here.\"Hearing those words of the Maharshi, the placid elderbrother of Lakshmana, taking up his bow with the arrow set,said \"O exalted one, if by means of sharpened shafts blazinglike lightning, I slay those herds of deer when theycome, it shall impart pain unto thee,—and what can be moreunfortunate than this? Therefore I shall not be able todwell long in this asylum.\" Having said this, Rāma ceasedand became engaged in his evening adorations, and, havingfinished them, along with Sitā and Lakshmana fixed hisquarters in the asylum of Sutikshna.

But thoucouldst by refraining from action, eschew this unrighteousnessthat springs from an evil begot of desire. This evil begotof desire is threefold. One prominent evil is falsehood,and both the others are of weightier significance,—association with others' wives, and vindictiveness without any(basis of) hostility. Falsehood, O Rāghava, hath never beenthine, nor can it ever be thine (in the future). Nor yet, Oforemost of men, canst thou ever even in fancy be (guilty of)going after others' wives, which marreth all religious merit.These, O Rāma, are by no means in thee. O King's son, thouever and a day directest thy attentions unto thy own wife.And thou art righteous and truthful and doest the will of thysire. In thee are established virtue and truth—and everything; and by help of thy conquered senses, thou, Omighty-armed one, art capable of bearing everything. And, O thouof a gracious presence, thine is control over sense. The thirdevil that leads men through ignorance to bear hostility towardsothers without any (cause of) hostility, is now present (untothee). Thou hast, O hero, for the protection of the saintsdwelling in the forest of Dandaka, promised the slaughterof Rākshasas in battle. And it is for this reason thatequipped with bows and arrows, thou hast along with thy brotherset out for the forest known as Dandaka. Seeing thee set out,my mind reflecting on thy truthfulness as well as thyhappiness in this world and welfare in the next, is wrought upwith anxiety. And, O hero, I do not relish this journey toDandaka. Thereof I will tell thee the reason. Do thou listento me as I tell thee. Bearing bows and arrows in thy hands,thou hast come to the wood along with thy brother; and (itmay well happen) that seeing grim rangers of the forest,thou mayst discharge thy shafts. And even as the vicinity offaggots increases the energy of (ire, the proximity of (the bow)enhances the strength and energy of the Kshatriya.Formerly, O long-armed one, in a sacred wood haunted by beastsand birds, there lived a truthful ascetic of a pure person.Intending to disturb his austerities, Sachi's lord, Indra,bearing a sword in his hand, came to the asylum in the guiseof a warrior. And in that asylum, that excellent scimitarwas deposited as a trust with that righteous personpractising asceticism. Receiving that weapon, that ascetic intentupon preserving his trust, rangeth the forest, maintaining hisfaith. And intent upon preserving his trust, he goethnowhere for procuring fruits and roots without that sworddeposited with him as a trust. Constantly carrying the sword,by degrees, the ascetic, foregoing all thoughts aboutasceticism, had his mind involved in fierce sentiments. Thus inconsequence of bearing that weapon, that ascetic taken upwith fierce thoughts, losing his sobriety and led astray fromrighteousness, went to hell. This ancient story anent thecarrying of arms, asserts that even as fire worketh change ina piece of wood, the presence of arms worketh alteration inthe mind of him bearing them. From affection and the highhonor in which I hold thee, I merely remind thee of this matter.I do not teach thee. Equipped with bows as thou art, thoushouldst renounce all thoughts of slaying without hostility theRākshasas residing in Dandaka. Without offence none shouldbe slain.—It is the duty of Kshatriya heroes by means of theirbows to protect persons of subdued souls, come by anycalamity. Where are arms? And where is the forest?Where is Kshatriya virtue? And where is asceticism? Thesearc opposed to each other,—let us, therefore, honor themorality that pertains to this place. From following arms,one's sense gets befouled and deformed. Again going toAyodhyā, thou wilt observe the duties of Kshatriyas. Thenmy mother-in-law and father-in-law shall experience enduringdelight, if, having renounced the kingdom, thou lead the lifeof an ascetic. Interest springs from righteousness; andhappiness also results therefrom. One attains everythingthrough righteousness—in this world the only substantialthing. Repressing self by diverse restrictions, intelligentpeople attain righteousness; but virtue crowned with felicity,is incapable of being attained by following pleasure. O mildone, ever cherishing thy heart in purity, do thou practisepiety, in the wood of asceticism. Everything—the threeworlds—are truly known unto thee. I have spoken thisthrough feminine fickleness. Who can speak of righteousnessunto thee? Reflecting on and understanding things, do thoualong with thy younger brother speedily do what thou likest.\""

These asceticsare devoured by terrible Rākshasas) living on human flesh.Being eaten up (by the Rākshasas), the anchorites living inthe forest of Dandaka—those best of the twice-born ones—said unto us—'Be thou gracious unto us.' Hearing thosewords of theirs which fell from their lips, I, resolving to actin accordance with their request, said,—'Be ye propitious.'This is surpassing shame unto me that such Vipras whothemselves are worthy of being sought, seek me. What shallI do? I said this in the presence of those twice-born ones.Thereat all those that had come, said, 'We have been, ORāma, immensely harassed in the forest of Dandaka byRākshasas wearing shapes at will.

We can by virtue of the energy of our asceticismeasily destroy the rangers of the night; but we are loathto lose our asceticism earned in a long time. O Rāghava,our austerities are constantly disturbed, and we can hardlyperform them. Therefore, although sore afflicted anddevoured by the Rākshasas dwelling in the forest of Dandaka,we do not cast our curse on them. Thou along with thybrother art our protector: thou art our master in this forest.'Having heard these words, I promised my perfect protectionunto the saints in the forest of Dandaka, O daughter ofJanaka. Having promised, I living cannot violate my vowconcerning the ascetics; verily truth is ever dear unto me.I had rather renounce my life, or thee, O Sitā, along withLakshmana,—but by no means my promise made, especiallyunto Brāhmanas. O Videha's daughter, the protection ofthe saints is incumbent on me even without anyrepresentation,—and what (shall I say) when I have promised thesame? Thou hast spoken this unto me through affectionand friendship. I have been well pleased with thee, O Sitā.One doth not instruct another that one doth not bear affectionto. O beauteous damsel, (what thou hast said) is worthy ofboth thy love and thy race. \" Having said these words untoMithilā's princess, the beloved Sitā, the high-souled Rāma,equipped with bows, along with Lakshmana, directed hissteps towards the inviting woods of asceticism."

Having proceeded a long way, when thesun was aslant, they together saw a delightful tankmeasuring a yojana, fifed with red and pale lotuses,graced with herds of elephants, and abounding in aquaticcranes, swans and Kadanivas. And in that tank containingcharming and pleasant waters, they heard sounds of songand instrumental music; but no one was seen there.Thereat, from curiosity, Rāma and Lakshmana—mightycar-warrior—asked an ascetic named Dharmabhrit,saying, \"Hearing10 this mighty wonder, we have beenworked up with intense curiosity. Do thou tell us whatthis is.\" Thus accosted by Rāghava, the ascetic thenat once began to expatiate over the potency of the pool.\"This tank goes by the name of Panchāpsara, and is alwaysfilled with water. It was made, O Rāma, by the asceticMāndakarni, by virtue of his asceticism. In yonder tank, themighty ascetic, living on air, performed signal austerities forten thousand years. Thereat, exceedingly agitated, all thedeities with Agni at their head, assembled together, said,'This ascetic wishes to have the position of one of us.' Thusall the deities present there were filled with anxiety. Thenwith the view of disturbing his austerities, the deities orderedfive principal Apsarās, possessed of the splendour of livelightning. And for compassing the end of the celestials, thatascetic conversant with the morality and otherwise as wellof this life as that to come, was brought by those Apsarāsunder the sway of Madana. And those five Apsarās(ultimately) became the wives of the ascetic; and their hiddenresidence was reared in the pool. And there the fiveApsarās living happily, pleased the anchorite, established inyouth through asceticism and yoga. As thy sport, we hearthe sounds of their musical instruments, and the sweet voiceof their song mixed with the tinklings of their instruments.\"(Hearing this), the illustrious Rāghava along with his brotherdeclared the story narrated by that one of a pure heart tobe wonderful. Thus conversing, Rāma saw the collectionof asylums, strewn with Kuça and bark, and be-girt withenergy derived from Brahma lore. Entering (the place) alongwith Vaidehi and Lakshmana, the highly famous Rāghavadwelt there respected by all the ascetics. Having happilydwelt in those collections of graceful asylums, honored ofthe Maharshis, Kākutstha by turns went to the hermitages ofthose ascetics with whom that one well versed in arms haddwelt before. And Rāghava happily passed his dayssomewhere for ten months, somewhere for one year, somewherefor four months somewhere for five or six months, somewherefor many months, somewhere for a month and a half,—somewhere for more, somewhere for three months, and somewherefor eight. And as Rāma lived in the asylums of theascetics and amused himself through their good graces, tenyears were passed away (in this way). Having gone roundthe asylums of all the ascetics, Rāghava cognizant ofrighteousness returned to the hermitage of Sutikshna. Comingto this asylum, respected by the ascetics, that subduer ofenemies, Rāma, stayed there for a time. Once upon a time,as Kākutstha dwelling in that asylum was seated, he humblyobserved unto that great ascetic, \"I have always heard frommen speaking on the subject that that foremost of ascetics,the reverend Agastya, lives in this forest. On account ofthe vastness of this forest, I do not know that place. Whereis the hermitage of that intelligent Maharshi? For propitiatingthat revered one, I, accompanied by my brother and Sitā, willgo to Agastya for paying our respects unto the ascetic. Thisgreat desire is burning in my heart, that I should myselfminister unto that best of anchorets.\" Hearing these wordsof the righteous-souled Rāma, Sutikhna, well pleased,answered Daçaratha's son, saying, \"I also am desirous oftelling thee this along with Lakshmana. Repair untoAgastya in company with Sitā, O RSghava. By luck thouhast thyself said this unto me as to thy purpose. I will, ORāma, tell thee where that mighty ascetic, Agastya, is. Mychild, go four miles from the hermitage in a southerlydirection; and thou wilt come to the hermitage of the brother ofthe auspicious Agastya situated on a land covered with trees,graced with Pippali woods, abounding in fruits and flowers,charming, and resonant with the notes of various birds. Thereare many tanks containing delightful waters, swarming withswans and Karandavas, and beauteous with Chakravakas.Passing a night there, do thou, O Rāma, in the morning,taking a southerly course, go by the skirts of the forest tract.Passing a yojana, thou shalt come upon Agastya's asylum,located at a charming woodland graced with many a tree.There Videha’s daughter and Lakshmana shall experiencedelight in thy company. O magnanimous one, if thou intendto see the mighty ascetic, Agastya, in that charmingwoodland, containing a great many trees, then do thou make upthy mind to set out this very day.” Hearing these words ofthe anchoret, Rāma, saluting him, along with his brother, set off for Agastya's(place) with his younger brother and Sitā.And, pleasantly proceeding by the way directed by Sutikshna,seeing pirturesque woods, hills resembling clouds, wateryexpanses and streams flowing by their path; Rāma filled withdelight said these words unto Lakshmana, “Surely we see theasylum of that high-souled one, the ascetic, Agastya’s brotherof pious acts. These trees standing by thousands onthe way bending beneath the weight of fruits andflowers, hear the signs that had been mentioned to me asbelonging to this wood. And from the wood is wafted bythe wind the pungent odour of ripe pippalis. And here andthere are found heaps of fire-wood, and torn Darva are seen,of the lustre of lapises. And the top of the column of smokebelonging unto the fire lit in the asylum in this wood,appears like the peak of a dark mountain. And twice-bornones, having performed their ablutions in sacred and retiredbathing places, are offering flowers gathered by themselves,O placid one, from what I had heard from Sutikshna, thiswould appear to be the asylum of Agastya’s brother. Therighteous Agastya it is who, wishing for the welfare of theworlds, destroying by virtue of his austerities a Daityaresembling Death, hath rendered this quarter habitable. Onceon a time here dwelt together two mighty Asuras, brothersgiven to slaughtering Brāhmanas—the wily Vātāpi and Ilwala.Wearing the form of a Brāhmana, and speaking Sanskrit,the cruel one used to invite Vipras to a Srāddha. And,cooking his brother wearing the shape of a sheep, he used to feedthe twice-born ones according to the rites prescribed forSrāddhas. Then when the Vipras had fed, Ilwala said,—\"O Vātāpi, come out, uttering a loud sound.\" Hearing hisbrother's words, Vātāpi, bleating like a sheep, came out, rivingtheir bodies. In this way, thousands of Brāhmanas gatheredtogether, were destroyed by flesh-eating ones wearing shapesat will. (And it came to pass that once upon a time) theMaharshi Agastya, having been invited to a Srāddha, fed onthe mighty Asura. Thereupon uttering—'Finished' andoffering water to wash hands with, Ilwala said unto his brother,'Come out'! And, as that brother of Vātāpi, given toslaughtering Vipras was speaking thus, that foremost of ascetics,the intelligent Agastya, said with a laugh, 'Where is thepower of coming out, of the Rākshasa, thy brother wearingthe shape of a sheep, who hath gone to Yama's abode?'Hearing his words, from wrath the ranger of the nightprepared to assail the ascetic, and he rushed against thatforemost of the twice-born ones. And, being consumed by thatascetic of flaming energy with his eyes resembling fire, theRākshasa met his end. This asylum graced with pools andgroves belongs to the brother of him who hath performedthis arduous feat from compassion for the Vipras'. AsRāma was thus conversing with Sumitrā's son, the sunset and evening approached. Then, duly performing hisafternoon adorations along with his brother, Rāma enteredthe hermitage, and saluted the ascetic. Well received by theascetic, Rāghava spent there a night, eating fruits and roots.When the night had passed away, and the solar disc arose,Rāghava greeted Agastya's brother, saying, \"O reverendSir, I salute thee. I have pleasantly passed the night. I greetthee; I shall go to behold my preceptor, thy elder brother.\"Thereat, on the ascetic's saying, 'Go thou,' the descendant ofRaghu went away by the prescribed route. And Rāma viewedthe forest, and Nihāras, and Panaças, and Sālas, Vanjulasand Tinisas, and Chirivilwas, and Madhukas, and Vilvas, andTindukas,—all in full flower, and graced with blossomingcreepers, and trees in the wood by hundreds, roughly handledby elephants with their trunks, and graced by monkeys, andresounding with the voices of an hundred maddened warblers.Then the lotus-eyed Rāma said unto that enhancer ofauspiciousness, the heroic Lakshmana, who was by him, and wasfollowing him at his back, \"The leaves of these trees areglossy, and the beasts and birds are mild, even as (we hadbeen told). The asylum of the pure-hearted Maharshi mustnot be far. This asylum capable of removing the fatigue ofthe weary, belonging to him that is known among men asAgastya by his own acts, is seen, with the (neighbouringwoods) filled with smoke, and itself decorated with bark andwreaths, containing herds of mild deer, and ringing with thenotes of various birds. This is the asylum of that pious one,who destroying (the Asura resembling) Death, hath, desirousof the welfare of mankind, rendered the Southern quarterhabitable, and through whose potency the Rākshasas fromfear barely cast their eyes in this direction, but do notapproach. Ever since that one of pious ways possessed himselfof this quarter, the rangers of the night have foregone theirhostility, and assumed a peaceful attitude. ThisSouthern quarter rendered safe (by Agastya),and incapable of beingharassed by those ones of tortuous ways, is celebrated overthe three worlds in conection with the name of the reverendascetic. And this graceful asylum ranged by mild beastsbelongs to that long-lived one of renowned achievements—Agastya—in obedience to whose command, the Vindhyamountain—foremost of its kind—which had always obstructedihe way of the Sun, doth not increase. This pious onehonored of men, ever engaged in the welfare of the righteous,shall do good unto us, who have come to him. I shall adorethe mighty ascetic, Agastya, and, O mild one, O master, herepass away the remainder of the term of my banishment.Here celestials with the Gandharbas, and Siddhas andeminent saints, observing restrictions in respect of food,adore Agastya. And the ascetic is such that a liar cannotlive here, nor a cunning or a crafty person, nor a wicked wight,nor one that is given to unrighteousness. And adoringrighteousness, celestials, and Yakshas, and Nāgas, and birds,live here restricting their fare. And high-souled Siddhasand eminent saints, renouncing their bodies, repair tocelestial regions in cars resembling the sun. And adoredby auspicious individuals, the deities here confer on them thestates of Yakshas and celestials, and divers kingdoms. OSumitra's son, entering the asylum before us, do thouannounce unto the saints that I along with Sitā, have arrivedhere.\""

  "Āranya, Kishkindhā, and Sundara Kāndam": "Having entered the asylum, Rāghava's youngerbrother, Lakshmana, coming to a disciple of Agastya, spokeunto him, saying, \"There was a king, named Daçaratha.His eldest son, the strong Rāma, hath come (to this asylum)along with his wife, Sitā, for seeing the ascetic.—NamedLakshmana, I am his younger brother, obedient and devotedto him.—Thou mayst have heard of it. Having entered thishorrid forest, in consonance with the mandate of our sire,we desire to see the reverend one. Tell this unto him.\"Hearing Lakshmana's words, that ascetic, saying. \"So be it!\",entered the chamber of the sacrificial fire, for the purposeof communicating (the news unto Agastya). Entering in,Agastya's beloved disciple, with joined hands communicatedunto that foremost of ascetics, incapable of being repressed,11exactly what Lakshmana had told him,—\"For seeing thereverend one, and serving him as well, those subduers oftheir foes, Daçaratha's sons, Rāma and Lakshmana,accompanied by Sitā, have entered this asylum. It now behovesthee to command what is to be done next.\" Hearing fromhis disciple that Rāma had come along with Lakshmanaand the highly virtuous Vaidehi, Agastya said, \"By luck itis that after a long time, Rāma hath come to see me. I hadmentally wished for his arrival. Go thou; and let Rāma,having been respectfully received, come before me. Whyhast thou not brought him thyself?\" Thus addressed by thehigh-souled and righteous ascetic, the disciple saluting him,with joined hands, said, \"So be it.\" Then issuing out, thedisciple said unto Lakshmana, \"Where is Rāma? Let himcome and enter in.\" Thereat, going to the asylum in companywith the disciple (of Agastya), Lakshmana showed unto himKākutstha and the daughter of Janaka, Sitā. Then joyfullycommunicating unto Rāma the words of the reverend one,the disciple (of Agastya) duly took in that one worthy ofbeing honored. And seeing the asylum teeming with milddeer, Rāma entered in with Lakshmana and Sitā. And thereRāma beheld the place of Brahma, and that of Agni,—that ofVishnu, and that of the great Indra, the place of Vivaswat,and that of Soma, and that of Bhaga, and that of Dhātā andVidhātā, and that of Vāyu, and that of the high-souledVāruna having the noose in his hand, and that of Gāyatri,and that of the Vasus, and that of the monarch of the Nāgas,and that of Garuda, and that of Kartikeya, and that of Dharma.And it came to pass that, surrounded by his disciples, theascetic came (before Rāma). And Rāma saw that one offlaming energy at the head of the ascetics; and the herosaid unto Lakshmana, enhancer of auspiciousness, \"OLakshmana, the revered saint, Agastya, is coming out. Irecognize that mass of asceticism by a certain kind of majesty(that characterizes him).\" Having said this touching Agastyaof the splendour of the sun, that son of Raghu took holdof his feet. Then, having paid him homage, Rāma withjoined hands stood there in company with Videha's daughter,Sitā, and Lakshmana. Thereat, embracing Rāma andhonoring him with water and a seat, and asking him questionsanent his welfare, the saint said, \"Welcome!\" Offeringoblations unto the fire, and presenting Arghya unto theguests, and paying them homage, that ascetic entertainedthem with food in accordance with the Vanasprastha modeof life; and then first sitting down, that foremost of ascetics,the pious Agastya, addressed Rāma cognizant ofrighteousness, staying with joined hands, \"O Kākutstha, if an asceticacts otherwise (in respect of a guest,) he in the nextworld feeds on his own flesh, like a false witness. Thesovereign of all the worlds, righteous, a mighty car warrior,worthy of being honored and worshipped, thou hast becomeour beloved guest.\" Having said this, Agastya, according tohis desire, worshipping Rāghava with fruits, roots and flowers,said unto him, \"O foremost of men, this mighty, celestial bowbelonging unto Vishnu, and constructed by Vicwakarmā,and this best of arrows (named) Brahmadatta, infallibleand resembling the sun, and this inexhaustible couple ofquivers filled with sharpened shafts, like unto flaming fire;were granted unto me by the mighty Indra. And here isthis mighty golden scabbard, and this sword deckedin gold. Having, O Rāma, slain the mighty Asuraswith this bow, Vishnu in days of yore in battlesecured the effulgent Fortune of the celestials. Obestower of honor, do thou for securing victory, take thisbow, these quivers, this arrow, and this scimitar, like theholder of the thunderbolt, taking the same.\" Having said thisthat highly energetic one, the reverend Agastya, consigningunto Rāma all those weapons, again said."

Ye arein trouble in consequence of the great fatigue that yehave undergone on the way. And Janaka's daughter, thenoble Maithili, is evidently eager (for rest). Of tender yearsand unknown to hardship, she hath come to the forest rifewith troubles, being urged by the love she bears unto her lord.Do thou, O Rāma, conduct thyself so, that Sitā may find apleasant time of it. By following thee to the forest, it is ahard task that she is performing. O son of Raghu, this hathbeen the nature of the fair sex from the commencement ofcreation, that they gladden him that is well off, and forsakea person in adversity. And women imitate the instability oflightning, the sharpness of weapons,and the celerity of Garudaand the wind12. But this wife of thine is absolutely free fromall these defects; she is worthy of being extolled and theforemost of those devoted to their lord, like Arundhatiamong the gods. This region, O Rāma, will be adorned,since, O subduer of enemies, thou along with Vaidehi andSumitra's son, wilt dwell here.\" Thus addressed by the ascetic,Rāghava, joining his hands, humbly observed unto that saintresembling flaming fire, \"Blessed and beholden am I, sincethe foremost of ascetics is gratified with my merits as well aswith those of my brother and wife. Do thou now direct me toa country well watered, and abounding in woods, whererearing an asylum, I may dwell delightfully and pleasantly.\"Hearing Rāma's words, that best of ascetics, reflecting for awhile, spoke these excellent words, \"Two Yojanas hence, mychild, is a region abounding in fruits and roots, containingcountless deer, and beautiful—known by the name ofPanchavati. Repairing thither, do thou, rearing an asylum, passthy time pleasantly in company with Sumitra's son, duly doingthe mandate of thy sire. O sinless one, all this news relatingto thyself, has from affection been known to me through thepotency of my asceticism, as also that relating to Daçaratha.Although thou hast promised to dwell with me in this asceticgrove, yet by virtue of my asceticism I know the desire that isin thy heart. I therefore tell thee, repair to Panchavati. Thatis a charming woodland, and there Mithilā's daughter shalldwell with delight. And that tract is worthy of all praise,and, O Rāghava, it is not distant from here.—It is in thevicinity of the Godāvari. Mithilā's daughter shall live thereagreeably. And that spot abounds in fruits and roots, isfrequented by various fowls, is retired, O mighty-armed one,and is sacred and beautiful. And thou of pure ways, andcompetent to protect the ascetics, shall, O Rāma, protectthem. O hero, yonder is the mighty wood of Madhukas.Directing thy course to the asylum of Nagrodha trees, go bythe north of this Madhuka wood. Then arriving at a spot hardby a hill, (thou wilt) come upon the celebrated Panchavati,crowned with blossoming woods.\" Thus accosted by Agastya,Rāma along with Sumitra's son, honouring the truth-speakingsaint, greeted him. Then, having saluted his feet, they, takingthe saint's permission, set out along with Sitā for thehermitage of Panchavati. And, taking their bows and quivers thosesons of the king, of undiminished martial virtue, with intentminds bent their course to Panchavati by the way laid downby the Maharshi."

And seeing him inthe forest, the exalted Rāma and Lakshmana, as they wereconversing With each other, knowing the bird to be (in reality)a Rākshasa, asked him, saying, \"Who art thou?\"Thereupon, in soft and sweet words, he, pleasing them, said, \"Mychild, know me for a friend of thy father.\" Knowing him tobe a friend of his sire, Rāghava paid him homage, andenquired for his name and lineage. Hearing Rāma's words,he mentioned his own lineage, and related the origin of allbeings. \"O mighty-armed one, I shall describe (unto thee)from the very beginning the (history of) those that werePrajāpatis in days of yore. Listen, O Rāghava. Of these,the first is Kardamā, then Vikrita, and then Sesha, Sancraya,the powerful Vahuputra, Sthānu, Marichi, Atri, the mightyKratu, Pulastya, Angira, Pracheta, Pulaha, Daksha,Vivaswat, Arishtanemi, O Rāghava, and the exceedinglyenergetic Kaçyapa. These had the west. The PrajāpatiDaksha, it hath been heard by us, O Rāma, had sixty famousand illustrious daughters. Of these Kaçyapa wed eight,with elegant waists;—Aditi, Diti, Danu, Kālikā,13 Tamrā,Krodhavasā, Manu and Analā. Then, well pleased, Kaçyapaagain said unto those damsels, \"Do thou bring forth sons likeunto myself, who shall be lords of the three worlds.\"Thereat, Aditi, O Rāma, Diti, Danu, and Kālikā, O mighty-armedone, consented,—the rest were of another mind. And ofAditi were born thirty-three deities, O repressor of thy foes,viz., the Adityas, the Vasus, the Rudras, and the Açwinas, Osubduer of enemies. And, my child, Diti gave birth to thosesons, the renowned Daityas. Formerly, this earth girt withseas was in the possession of these. And, O vanquisher ofthy foes, Danu gave birth to a son, named, Açwagriva. AndKalika brought forth Naraka and Kālaka. And Tamra gavebirth to these five daughters celebrated in the world,—Kraunchi, Bhāsi, Syeni, Dhritarshtri, and Suki. AndKraunchi gave birth to the Ulukas, and Bhāsi, to Bhāsas, andSyeni to hawks and vultures possessed of energy; andDhritarashtri to swans, all kinds of Kalahansas, andChakravākas, and that damsel, Suki, to Natā. AndVinatā was Natā's daughter. And Krodhavasā, O Rāma,brought forth ten daughters, viz., Mrigi, Mrigamandā, Hari,Bhadramadā, Mātangi, Sārduli, Swetā, Surabhi crownedwith every (auspicious mark), Surasā and Kadrukā. And,thou foremost of the best of men, Mrigi's sons wereall the deer, and those of Mrigamandā. were bears, Srimārasand Chamaras. And Bhadramadā bore one daughter, Irāvati.And Irāvati's son is the mighty elephant, who is the lord of theworlds. And Hari's sons are lions and the nimble monkeys.And Sārduli brought forth as her sons, Golāngulas, andtigers; and the offspring of Mātangi were mad elephants,O best of men. And Swetā, O Kākutstha, gave birth tothe elephants of the cardinal points. And, O Rāma,Surabhi gave birth unto two daughters—the famous Rohini,and Gandharbi. Rohini produced kine, and the sons ofGandharbi are horses. And Surasā, O Rāma, gave birth toNāgas, and Kadru, to Pannagas. And Kāçyapa's otherwife Manu begot mankind—Brāhmanas, Kshatriyas,Vaiçyas, and Sudras. From the mouth, it is known,sprang Brāhmanas, from the breast, Kshatriyas, from thethighs, Vaiçyas, and from the feet, Sudras. And Analāproduced all trees bearing sacred fruits. Vinatā (was) Suki'sgrand-daughter, and Kadru, Surasā's aunt. And Kadru gavebirth to a thousand Nāgas with the holder of the Earth. AndVinatā brought forth two sons,—Garuda, and Aruna. Andfrom Aruna sprang myself and my elder brother Sampāti. Osubduer of enemies, know me for Jatāyu, the son of Syeni.If thou will, I shall become thy help during thy abode (in thewoods). And, O child, I shall protect Sitā when thou shaltgo out along with Lakshmana.\" There Rāghava paying homageunto Jatāyu, and embracing him joyfully, bent low; and thatself-possessed one listened to the story of Jatāyu'sfriendship with his father, as related by him repeatedly. Thenconsigning unto that bird of exceeding strength, Mithilā'sdaughter, Sitā, Rāma accompanied by Lakshmana went toPanchavati, destroying his foes and protecting the worlds."

This, O amiable one, isPanchavati furnished with blossoming woods. Do thou castthy eyes around this forest, and (ascertain) what spot shallsuit our asylum. Do thou find out such a place in thevicinity of a tank where thyself Sitā and I may dwell happily,which is graced with the garniture of woods and delightfulwith liquid lapses, and whose neighbourhood yields fuel,flowers, Kuça and water.\" Thus addressed by Rāma,Lakshmana with joined hands, said unto Kākutstha in the presenceof Sitā, \"O Kākutstha, even if I were to stay with thee foran hundred years, I shall remain thy servant. Thyselfselecting some beauteous spot, do thou tell me—'Construct(an asylum).'\" Well pleased with the words of Lakshmana,that highly effulgent one, after due reflection, selected a sitehaving every recommendation. Going to that romantic spotfor rearing an asylum, Rāma, taking the hand of Sumitra'sson in his, said unto him, \"This place is level, graceful, andsurrounded with blossoming trees. Do thou duly constructan asylum at this spot. Hard by is seen a beautiful pool,embellished with lotuses, resembling the sun, and breathingbalmy perfume. And, as told by that pure-hearted ascetic,Agastya, this is the graceful Godavari, bordered by floweringtrees;—swarming with swans and Kārandavas, delighted withChakravākas; thronged with herds of deer14, not far, yet notso very near. And resounding with the cries of peacocks;charming; elevated; containing full many a cave; do thou, Oamiable one, behold these hills, covered with trees in fullflower; and they are shining like elephants painted withdiverse colors by persons with the utmost care; adornedwith Sālas, palmyras, Tamālas, dates, Panasas, Nivāras,Tinisas, and Punnāgas. And covered with mangos, andTilakas, and Ketakas, and Champakas, and trees entwinedby flowers and herbs and plants; and containing Syandanas,sandals, Nipas, Panasas, Lakuchas, Dhavas, Açwakarnas,Khadiras, Samis, Kinçukas and Pātalas. This spot is sacred—this spot is charming—this spot abounds in beasts andbirds. Here will I dwell, O Sumitra's son, in company withthis bird15.\" Thus addressed by Rāma, the exceedinglypowerful Lakshmana, slayer of hostile heroes, in a short timeraised an asylum for his brother. And the exceedingly stoutLakshmana created there for Rāghava a spacious hut thatchedwith leaves made of clay, furnished with pillars, constructedwith long bamboos, graceful,—spread with Sami boughs;tightly fastened with strong cords; covered with Kuçā,reeds, and leaves; with its floor well leveled; and charming;beautiful to look at, and exceedingly excellent. And thengoing to the river Godavari, the lovely Lakshmana,performing his bath, and securing lotuses and fruits, came back (tothe asylum). Then offering flowers, and duly performingrites for the peace (of the habitation), Lakshmana showedthe asylum which he had made unto Rāma. Seeing thebeautiful asylum along with Sitā, Rāghava experienced highraptures. And joyfully embracing Lakshmana with his arms,Rāma said these exceedingly calm and solemn words, \"Pleasedam I with thee. Thou hast done a great deed, my brother;for which I have granted thee my embrace by way ofreward. While thou, his son, skilled in reading thought,grateful, and cognizant of righteousness art alive, OLakshmana, my father is not dead.\" Having said this untoLakshmana, Rāghava-the enhancer of auspiciousness—experiencingfelicity , began to dwell happily in that region filled with fruits.And ministered unto by Sitā and Lakshmana, that righteousone lived there, like the immortals in heaven."

  "Āranya, Kishkindhā, and Sundara Kāndam": "As the high-souled Rāghava was dwelling therepeacefully, after autumn had departed, the welcome wintercommenced. And it came to pass that once on a time, when thenight had passed away and day broke, that son of Raghuwent to the romantic river Godāvari for performing his bath.And as the humble son of Sumitrā Rāma's puissant brotherbearing a water pitcher in his hand was following Rāma alongwith Sitā at his back, the former said unto Rāma, \"Osweet-speeched one, now is come that season which thou hast everheld dear; and as if decorated by which comes on the entireauspicious year. Now people have their persons renderedrough from dew; the earth is replenished with corn; wateris difficult of being used; and fire becomes enjoyable. Andmen having worshipped the gods and the Pitris by celebratingAgrayana on the occasion of partaking new rice, have atthis season, their sins purged off. The provinces overflowwith food, and abound in milk and articles prepared there-from; and kings bent on conquest, range about for surveyingthem. And on the sun having veered steadily to the quarterpresided over by the Destroyer16, the north appears like afemale without her tilaka17. Naturally abounding in snow,and now having the sun at a great distance, the mountainHimavān18 justly beareth that name. At miday the days aredelightful to a degree to range in, feel highly agreeable, andhave pleasant suns; while shade and water areuncomfortable. And the days now have mild suns, are coveredwith dew, severely cold, with the forests remaining idle19,and the lotuses destroyed by frost. And now at night peoplecannot lie down in unsheltered places; and the nights areinferred from the presence of Pushyā. And at night theatmosphere (being covered with vapour) looks brown; and itis bitter cold then; and the hours are long. And the goodfortune of the Moon hath fallen to the Sun; and the disc ofthe former is reddish with vapour; and like unto a glassbreathed upon, it doth not shine clearly. And the moonlightfurnished by vapour doth not appear pleasant; and like Sitāpallid because of (exposure to) sunshine, is perceptible, butdoth not look beauteous. And at this season the westernwind naturally of gelid feel, being permeated at present withcold, blows with double coldness. And the forests envelopedin mist, and stocked with wheat and barley, look brilliant atsunrise, with Kraunchas and cranes crying (in chorus).Golden-hued paddy slightly inclined, appear graceful, withtheir heads like unto date-flowers filled with rice. And thesun although high advanced, yet having its rayscovered with thick mist, appeareth like the moon. And feebleat the first part of the day, and of agreeable touch at mid-day,the sunshine, being surcharged with mist, appeareth palishover the face of the earth. And in the woods, swardscovered with green grass, and with dew-drops on it, lookhandsome on the morning sun brightening it up. And wildelephants waxing exceedingly thirsty, draw away their trunks,just as they touch beautifully clear and cold water. Andthose aquatic fowls seated by, do not dip themselves in thewater, like unto cravens shunning fight. And the rows oftrees, shorn of their blossoms, on being enveloped with dewat night and mist at morn, look as if they were fast asleep.And the streams appear with their waters enveloped invapour,and the cranes, perceived through their cries, and theirbanks having their sands wet. And what on account of thesnow-fall, what of the mildness of the sun, and what throughthe cold, water even when it is on a mountain top, tastessweet. And lotuses afflicted by the cold, with the stalks onlyleft, and with their petals dropping down and their pericarpsand filaments shrivelled up, do not appear beautiful. And,O foremost of men, at this season, influenced by regard forthee, Bharata undergoing affliction of spirit, is performingmortifications in the city. And forsaking kingdom, anddignity, and the many and various enjoyments, Bharatapractising asceticism and restraining himself in respect of food,in this winter lieth down on the bare earth. And he also, forcertain, at this hour of the day, surrounded by his subjects,daily wendeth to the river Sarayu for performing his ablutions.Brought up in luxury, and exceedingly tender, how can he,afflicted with cold, perform his ablutions during the latterpart of the night? Of eyes resembling lotus petals,grey-hued, endued with grace, with a navel depressed, and mighty,Bharata understandeth righteousness, is truth-speaking, ofrestrained senses (in respect of others' wives) and also ofsubdued senses. And he speaketh fair, and is sweet-tempered,and long-armed and the vanquisher of foes. Andrenouncing various pleasures, he hath devoted himself unto the nobleone. Thy high-souled brother hath secured heaven, sincehe, resorting to asceticism, is imitating thee that resident inthe woods. The saying that people follow their motherand not their father, is falsified in the case of Bharata. Howcan mother Kaikeyi, whose husband is Daçaratha and son therighteous Bharata, have such crooked way?\" As the virtuousLakshmana was speaking thus from affection, Rāghava,not bearing the blame cast upon his mother (Kaikeyi), said,\"My brother, thou shouldst by no means, tax our secondmother. Do thou talk of that lord of the Ikshwāku race,Bharata. Albeit my mind is firm as regards my sojourn inthe woods, yet is my mind unsteady, being inflamed withaffection for Bharata. I remember his dear sweet words,taking the heart, resembling ambrosia, filling the soul withdelight. When shall I, O son of Raghu, meet with thehigh-souled Bharata, and the heroic Satrughna, and thyself?20\"Having bewailed thus, Kākutstha, coming to the riverGodavari, there performed his ablutions in company withyounger brother and Sitā. Then having offered hisadorations with water unto the gods and the Pitris, those sinlesshymned the risen sun as well as the celestials. Having withSitā as the second and Lakshmana, performed his bath. Rāmalooked beautiful like that lord the reverend Rudra in companywith Nandi and the daughter of the king of mountains."

Arrivingat the asylum, Rāghava along with Lakshmana, performinghis morning devotions, entered the cottage. And honoredof the Maharshis Rāma happily dwelt in that cottage; andseated with Sitā that mighty-armed one looked like the Moonin conjunction with Chitra. And he carried on variousconverse with his brother Lakshmana. As Rāma was thus seatedwith his mind engrossed in that talk, A Rākshasi came tothat region at her will. And that one named Surpanakhā,sister unto the ten-necked Rākshasa, coming upon Rāma, sawhim like a celestial, having a leonine chest, mighty-arms,and expansive eyes resembling lotus leaves, with thepowerful gait of the elephant, wearing a head of matted locks, witha resplendent countenance, bearing regal marks. Andbeholding Rāma dark-blue like the lotus, and becoming likeKandarpa himself, and resembling Indra, the Rākshasi wasmaddened with desire. Rāma was graced with a beauteouscountenance, that Rākshas had a hideous face; Rāma hada slender waist, she had a huge abdomen; he had expansiveeyes, she had terrible eyes; he was gifted with an eleganthead of hair, she had coppery hair; Rāma was of adear presence, she was of an unsightly presence;Rāma had a sonorous voice, she had a hedeous voice;Rāma was youthful, the Rākshasi was an old hag; Rāmahad mellifluous accents, she had harsh accents; Rāmawas ever abiding by justice, she was unruly; Rāmawas handsome, she was ugly. That Rākshasi beingwrought up with passion addressed Rāma saying\"Wearing matted locks, and equipped with bows and arrows,why hast thou along with thy wife come to thisregion haunted by Rākshasas? It behoveth thee to saywhat the object of thy visit is.\" Thus accosted by theRākshasi, Surpanakha, that subduer of his foes from sincerityof disposition began to relate everything:—\"There was aking named Daçaratha endeued with the prowess of acelestial. I am his eldest son known among men by the name ofRāma. This is my younger brother (named) Lakshmana,(ever) serving me. This is my wife, known by the name ofSitā. Commanded by my father and mother, I in obedienceto their mandate, desirous of acquiring religious merits, havefor the purpose of securing righteousness, come to thisforest for dwelling here. I also am anxious to know thee.Whose daughter art thou? And what is thy name, and what isthy lineage? Possessed of a captivating form, thouappearest to me as a Rākshasi. Tell me truly why thou hast comehere.\" Hearing these words the Rākshasi, afflicted with lust,said, \"Listen, O Rāma. I will relate everything truly, Iam a Rākshasi, capable of wearing shapes at will. My nameis Surpanakha. Striking terror into the hearts of all, I rangethis forest alone. My brother is named Rāvana.21 Thoumayst have heard of him. And he that is given to long sleep—the mighty Kumbhakarna, the righteous Bibhishana, whonever serves the Rākshasas, and the brothers Khara andDushana renowned in conflict (are also my brothers).Rāma, I have surpassed them all (in prowess). At first sightof thee, I approach thee, thou best of men, as my husbandwith (feelings of) love. I am endeued with power, and rangeabout at will by virtue of my strength.

To females like unto thee co-wife-hood isexceedingly miserable. This young brother of mine isgood-looking, and is of an excellent character; he is graceful, andis still unwived.

And with me thou wilthappily range these Dandakas.\" Thus accosted by the Rākshasi,Sumitri's son, Lakshmana versed in speech, with a smileappropriately observed unto Surpanakhā, \"Why wishest thouto be the servant of me who am a servant myself?22 Olotus-hued one, I am dependant on my noble brother, O thou ofexpansive eyes, be thou securing the summum bonum, witha joyful heart, become, O superbly beautiful wench, theyounger wife of the noble one of great good fortune.Renouncing this frightful, unchaste, hideous, old wife possessed ofa lean abdomen; he will devote himself unto thee. O paragonamong damsels, O supremely charming lady, what manpossessed of discernment, passing by such grace, would bearaffection to a human female?\" Thus accosted by Lakshmana,that hideous one having a lean abdomen being incapable ofunderstanding jest, took his words as true. Thereupon asthat subduer of enemies, the irrepressible Rāma, was seatedin the cottage in company with Sitā, the Rākshasi, transportedwith lust, said unto him, \"Forsaking this deformed, unchaste,horrible old wife of thine possessed of a lean abdomen, thoudost not regard me. To-day, thou looking on, I shall eat upthis human female. And I shall, rid of a co-wife, happilyrange with thee.\" Having said this, even as a mighty meteorstriketh Rohini, that one having eyes resembling live coals,waxing exceedingly enraged, rushed towards that (damsel)with the eyes of a doe. Thereupon, hindering the Rākshasiresembling the noose of death, as she was rushing on, themighty Rāma, growing wroth, said unto Lakshmana, \"OSaumitri23, what is the good of jesting with a base andwicked one?

It behoves thee, O foremost ofmen, to deform this frightful, unchaste Rākshasi of a hugeabdomen, transported with lust.\" Thus desired theexceedingly strong Lakshmana, fired with wrath, taking out hissword, in the sight of Rāma, cut off her nose and ears. Herears and nose cut off, the terrible Surpanakhā, utteringfrightful cries, fled amain into the forest whence she had come.And being deformed, and covered with gore, the dreadfulRākshasi sent up many a roar, like clouds rumbling in therains. And bleeding profusely, the grimvisaged Rākshasi,lifting up her arms, and roaring, entered the mighty forest.Then, having been deformed, (the Rākshasi) approaching,her brother of fierce energy, Khara, come to Janasthāna,(seated surrounded by numbers of Rākshasas), fell down to theearth, even as the thunder-bolt bursts from the sky. Thenthat sister of Khara, bathed in blood, and deprived of hersenses through fright, related ail about Rāma's arrival at theforest along with Lakshmana and his own wife, as well as thecircumstances connected with her being deformed."

Leave off fear and amazement.Tell me plainly by whom thou hast been thus deformed. Whois it that with his finger-end hath by way of sport hurta black venomous snake that was innocent? He thatcoming in contact with thee hath to-day drunk virulentpoison, winding a fatal noose round about his neck, knowethit not through ignorance. Endowed with strength andprowess, ranging about at will, wearing shapes at pleasure, andresembling the destroyer himself, going to whom hast thoucome by this condition? Who among the gods, Gandharbasor creatures or the high souled saints is of such mightyenergy as to have deformed thee? In this world I do not seehim that would do me wrong. Even as a crane afflicted withthirst appropriated milk mixed in water (leaving the latterout), so by means of fleet and life destroying shafts willI among the immortals take the life of that chastiser ofPāka, the thousand-eyed mighty Indra. The frothy blood ofwhom, having his marrow pierced (by me) and slain by mein battle, doth the Earth wish to drink? Tearing off fleshfrom the corpse of whom slain by me in conflict, shall thebirds so joyfully feed on it? Him, whom I shall wrongmightily, neither the gods, nor the Gandharbas, nor thePiçāchas25, nor the Rākshasas, will be able to rescue infierce encounter. Recovering by degrees thy sense, itbehoves thee to tell me what individual it was of execrablecharacter, who by his prowess, hath humbled thee in theforest.\" Hearing these words of his brother, who was underthe influence of extreme rage, Surpanakhā. with tears in hereyes, said, \"Tender, and endowed with beauty, possessed ofyouth and gifted with great strength, with expansive eyesresembling white lotuses; clad in bark and dark dear-skins,subsisting on fruits and roots, having their senses undercontrol; leading an ascetic life and a Brahmacharya mode ofexistence; there are two sons of Daçaratha the brothers Rāmaand Lakshmana resembling the Sovereign of the Gandharbhasand marked with signs betokening royalty. I cannotascertain whether they be celestials, or human beings. Andbetween them I saw there a youthful female furnished withgrace, and having a dainty waist; adorned with every kind ofornament. And it is on account of this female that I havelike one unchaste and uncared for, have come by thiscondition at their hands. Nor I wish in the midst of encounterto drink the frothy blood of that crooked one as well as thosetwo slain (in battle). Let this my prime wish be crownedthere with fruition. Her and their blood will I drink indreadful conflict.\" As she said this, Khara wrought up withboundless passion, said, \"Two human beings accoutred in arms,and wearing bark and dark deer-skins have in company witha female entered this deep Dandaka forest. Do ye return,after slaying them, as well as that wicked one. And thissister of mine will drink their blood. Ye Rākshasas, eventhis is my sister's dear desire. Repairing thither, speedilyaccomplish this, bearing them down by your native might.Seeing those two brothers slain by you. this one, exceedinglyrejoiced, will drink their blood in the field.\" Thuscommissioned, those fourteen Rākshasas set out there like cloudsdriven by the winds, accompanied by Surpanakhā."

And they saw the mighty Rāma seated in thecottage in company with Sitā, and ministered unto byLakshmana. And seeing her, as well as the Rākshasas whohad come, Rāma remarked unto his brother, Lakshmana offlaming energy, saying, \"O Sumitra's son, do thou for awhile guard Sitā. I shall slay these that have come tothis asylum here.\" Hearing these words of Rāma versedin the knowledge of self, Lakshmana honored his speechby saying, \"So be it.\" And the righteous Rāghava strunghis mighty bow decked with gold; and addressed theRākshasas, saying, \"We that have entered into thisuntractable forest of Dandaka in company with Sitā are thesons of Daçaratha, the brothers, Rāma and Lakshmana.Why do you intend to do injury unto us. Subsisting onfruits and roots, having our senses under control, carryingon asceticism and leading a Brahmacharya life, we arepassing our days in the forest of Dandaka. It is to destroyyou, wicked, and troublesome that I equipped with the bowhave come here at the desire of the saints. Stay therecontent you should not move further. If you have a care foryour lives, desist, ye rangers of the night.\" Hearing thosewords of his, those fourteen grim Rākshasas bearing dartsin their hands, exceedingly enraged, with their eyesreddened, breathing high spirits, harshly said unto thesweet-speeched Rāma, having his eyes reddened, whose prowessthey had not seen before, \"Having excited there ourlord, the high-souled Khara, it is thou that shalt lose thylife no later than this day, being slain by us in battle. Whatpower hast thou, being one, to stay before us many, in thefield,—what shall I say of thy coping with us in conflict?In consequence of the parighas, darts, and pathifasdischarged by our arms, thou wilt surely lose thy life, along withthy prowess, and this bow which thou pressest with thyhand.\" Having said this in wrath, those fourteen Rākshasuplifting their weapons and daggers rushed towards Rāmaand discharged darts at the invincible Rāghava. ThereuponKākutstha by means of shafts decked with gold, cut off thosefourteen darts of theirs. Seeing this, that exceedinglyenergetic one, waxing highly enraged, took out fourteen nārāchas,whetted on stone, resembling the sun. And even as Satakratuhurls the thunderbolt, Rāghava drawing his bow and takinghis aim at the Rākshasas, let go those shafts. And thoseRākshasas, their breasts pierced with vehemence, andthemselves bathed in blood, fell down to the earth, likesnakes dropping down from an ant hill. And with theirbreasts pierced, they, dripping with blood, deformed anddeprived of their lives, lay on the ground like trees whoseroots have been severed. Seeing them fallen on the groundthe Rākshasi, beyond herself in wrath, approaching Khara,with her blood a little dried up, again in distressful guisethrew herself on the earth, like a plant exuding gum. Andin presence of her brother, she set up a mighty roar; andthen her face grown pallid, she dropped tears, emitting cries.Seeing those Rākshasas slain in battle, Surpanakhā againhastened (to her brother), and the sister of Khara, relateddetail the slaughter of those Rākshasas."

Do not fear, cast offthy stupor.\" Thus addressed, and consoled by Khara, thatirrepressible one, wiping her eyes, spoke unto Khara,\"Having had my nose and ears cut off, I had come hither,covered with blood; and thou hadst consoled me. And thoualso hadst despatched fourteen heroic Rākshasas, for mybehoof, for slaying the terrific Rāghava along withLakshmana.

Restrainthy tears, and remove thy fear. I shall despatch Rāmaalong with his brother to the abode of Yama.

Atfirst reprimanded by her and then praised, Khara spoke untohis general, named Dushana, saying, \"Do thou, O gentleone, array fourteen thousand of those Rākshasas, gifted withfurious vehemence, ever following my wish, who never turnaway from the field; who are hued like unto purpleclouds, who revel in cruelty,28 and who are elated (inconsequence of their prowess).

And beholding that mighty armyconsisting of cars and arms and pennons, Khara as well asDushana, said unto that multitude of Rākshasas, \"Marchforth!\" And then uttering tremendous roars, rushed outwith great vehemence four and ten thousands of thoseterrible Rākshasas equipped with clubs and pattisas and dartsand sharpened axes, and scimitars and discuses,—shiningbeautifully in their hands and saktis and dreadful parighasand innumerable bows, and maces, and mushalas and vajrasfearful to behold, griped fast.

Thentaking the permission of Khara, the charioteer drove atspeed those powerful steeds decked in shining gold. Anddriven with speed, the car of Khara—slayer of foes—filled alldirections with its rattle.

And the steeds yoked to his (Khara's)car, gifted with great celerity, dropped down all of a suddenon the level high ways strewn with blossoms. A dark circlebordered with red, resembling that of charcoal, appeared inthe vicinity of the sun. And a frightful vulture, having ahuge body, approaching the banner, sat upon the upraisedgolden flagstaff. And beasts and birds having shrill voices,living on flesh, remaining near Janasthāna, emitted variousdissonant notes. And in the quarter lighted up by thefierce jackals having mighty voices, in dreadful criespresaged evil unto the Rākshasas. And terrific clouds surchargedwith water and blood, and resembling elephants with renttemples, enveloped the sky. And a dense darkness appeared,capable of making one's hair stand on end, and no quarterwas distinctly visible. And out of season, there appearedevening hued like a cloth soaked in blood. And facingKhara, terrible beasts and birds set up cries. Kankas,Gomayas and vultures, portending fear, began to cry. Everinauspicious in war, jackals presaging evil, with theirmouths belching forth flame, howled in the face of the forces.And comets, resembling parighas appeared beside the sun.That mighty planet Swarbhānu seized the sun whenthere was no parva. And the winds blew violently; and thesun was without lustre. And when there was no night, starswearing the sheen of fireflies, began to fall. And in thetanks fishes and fowls were inert, and the lotuses werewithered. And at that hour the trees were shorn of fruitsand flowers; and without wind there arose dust dusky likeclouds. And the parrots uttered wild notes—chichikuchi.And meteors of terrific aspects fell with loud noises. Andthe earth with her mountains, woods, and forests, shook.And as the intellegent Khara was roaring from his car, hisleft arm shook, and his voice fell, and as he surveyed around,his eyes moistened, and his head ached; yet throughignorance, he did not desist. Witnessing these mighty portentscapable of making one's hair stand on end, Khara with a laugh,addressed the whole body of Rākshasas, saying, \"Even as astrong person from prowess counts not a weak one, I do notdwell upon all these mighty portents, dreadful to behold, thathave appeared. Even the stars will I bring down fromheaven with my sharp shafts; and even Death will I engaged,bring to mortality. Without slaying Rāghava puffed up withpride as well as Lakshmana, by means of sharp weapons, Ireturn not (from the conflict). Let that sister of mine, forwhom Rāma and Lakshmana have had sense perverted, attainher desire, by drinking their blood. I had never before metwith defeat in conflict. Ye have witnessed it. I do not speaka falsehood. Wrought up with rage, I shall slay in fight thesovereign of the celestials himself, going on his mad Airāvata,with the thunderbolt in his hand,—what shall I say of thosetwo, who are human beings? Entangled in the noose ofdeath, that mighty army of the Rākshasas, hearing hischallenge, experienced boundless enthusiasm. And anxiousto see the encounter, there came high-souled saints, andcelestials, and Gandharbas, and Siddhas, with the Charānas.And these pious ones assembled, spoke unto one another,\"Welfare unto those cows, and Brāhmanas, and those thatare prized by the worlds! As the discus-handed Vishnuvanquished the foremost Asuras, may Rāghava rout in battlethose rangers of the night, the progeny of Pulastya! Andsaying this as well as various other things, the supremesaints and the celestials stationed in the sky conceivingcuriosity (as to the issue of the conflict), beheld the host ofthose Rākshasas, whose days had been numbered. Thenimpetuously Khara issued in his car from the van of thearmy.30 And these twelve endowed with exceedingprowess, viz., Synagāmi, Prithuçyāma, Yaynaçatru, Vihangama,Duryyaya, Karavirāksha, Purusha, Kālakānuka, Maghamāli,Mahāmali, Sarpasya, and Rudhirāçana posted themselvesaround Khara.

And beholding those dreadful portents, Rāmaexceedingly distressed, apprehending some calamity to theRākshasas, observed unto Lakshmana, \"O mighty armedone, behold these great presages that have taken place,capable of annihilating all beings, and which have for theirobject the utter extermination of the Rakhasas! Yonderthreatening clouds of assinine sable, showering down bloodand uttering loud sounds are ranging the welkin. And, Odiscerning one, rejoicing at the prospect of my fight, allthese arrows emit smoke, and my bows plaited on the backwith gold, are restless. Meseems from the noise of thewild birds that impending on us is danger anduncertainty to life. Without doubt, there shall take placea mighty conflict. At this critical time, my arm shakingmomentarily, betokens, O hero, victory unto us, and defeatunto the enemy. And thy face appeareth pleasant with adelightful lustre. O Lakshmana, the pallid face of thosethat prepare for conflict, auger shortening of life. We canhear the shouts of the Rākshasas as they roar, as also theblasts of the trumpets of those doomed to be woundedblown by Rākshasas of remorseless deeds. A considerateperson that wisheth for his welfare, apprehending peril,should prevent disaster ere it arrives. Therefore bearingarrows in thy hand, and equipped with thy bow, do thou,taking Videha's daughter, take refuge in the mountaincavern, covered with trees and difficult of access. That thoushouldst act contrary to my words, is what I do not wish.Swearing by my feet, go thou without delay, my brother. Thouart both strong and a hero: Thou canst, without doubt,slay these (Rākshasas). But I wish to slay all these rangersof the night myself.\" Thus accosted by Rāma, Lakshmana,taking arrows and a bow, took refuge in an inaccessiblecave along with Sitā. Thereupon, saying, \"Ah! we havespoken it sharp,\" Rāma put on his mail. And adorned withthat mail resembling fire Rāma appeared in the dark like amighty flame streaming up. And uplifting his bow, andtaking his arrows, that powerful one stood there, feelingall directions with the twangs of his bow-string. Then thehigh-souled gods and Gandharbas, Siddhas and Charanascame there, with the intention of witnessing the fight. Andhigh-souled saints of the world, and the foremost Brahmarshis,of pious acts, coming together, spoke unto one another,saying, \"Hail to cows and Brāhmanas, and all those inwhom are established the worlds! May Rāghava vanquishin fight those rangers of the night, the progeny of Pulastya,even as the discus-handed Vishnu routed in battle theforemost Asuras!\" Having said this, they again spoke, eyingone another, \"There are fourteen thousand of the Rākshasasof dreadful deeds, while the righteous Rāma is single. Howcan fight take place (between two such parties)?\" Havingsaid this, the Rajarshis, Siddhas, multitudes of the beet ofthe twice-born ones, and celestials stationed in the sky weremoved with curiosity (as to the issue of the conflict). Thenseeing Rāma filled with energy, remaining in the field, allbeings from fear experienced great pain. And the peerlessgrace of Rāma of energetic deeds became like unto that ofthe high souled infuriated Rudra.32 While the gods,Gandharbas and Charanas were thus conversing, the forces ofthe Rākshasas sending up solemn sounds, furnished withhorrible armour, arms and flags, conversing in heroicparlance, roaring at each other, stretching bows, momentarilyyawning,33 sending forth shouts, and blowing trumpets. Theuniversal uproar filled that (entire) forest. Scared andterrified at the hubbul the rangers of the wood fled to quartersfree from noise; nor did they cast their eyes backward.And that army resembling the ocean, and rife with sounds,equipped with various weapons, with furious speed cametowards Rāma. And Rāma also versed in warfare, castinghis eyes arround, found the forces of Khara ready for fight.34Then stretching his dreadful bow, and swiftly taking outshafts, (Rāma) for compassing the destruction of the entirebody of the Rākshasas, waxed furiously enraged. And likeunto the flaming fire at the universal dissolution, he, growingwroth, was incapable of being looked at. And seeing himfilled with energy, the sylvan deities were extremely pained.35And the aspect of the enraged Rāma appeared like that ofthe holder of Pināka, intent upon destroying Daksha'ssacrifice. Furnished with bows and ornaments and cars and mailhued like fire, that army of those subsisting on flesh,appeared like masses of blue clouds at sunrise."

And seeing him, Khara possessinga shrill voice, raising his bow, commanded unto thecharioteer to drive towards Rāma,—\" Drive on!\" At Khara'scommand, the charioteer drove the steeds to where themighty-armed Rāma stood alone, holding his bow. And seeinghim (Khara) entered the field, all those rangers of thenight—the counselors—uttering mighty shouts, environedhim round. And Khara stationed on his car in the midstof Rākshasas appeared like red bodied one risen in themidst of the stars. Then in battle Khara, afflicting Rāmaof incomparable energy with a thousand shafts, uttered atremendous roar. Then all the rangers of the night, waxingexceeding wroth, showered various weapons on that terriblebowman, the invincible Rāma. And wrought up with rage,the Rākshasas in battle assailed him with iron clubs,and darts, and prāsas, and swords, and axes. Andresembling clouds (in hue), the exceedingly strong Rākshasas,having huge bodies, darted towards Kākutstha by meansof steeds and cars. And mounted on elephants resemblingmountain-peaks, numbers of Rākshasas, intent upon slayingRāma in battle, showered arrows on him, as mighty cloudspour down showers on the monarch of mountains. AndRāma was hemmed in by all those fierce-looking Rākshasaseven as in the evening Mahādeva is surrounded by hiscourtiers. And as the ocean resisteth the tide of a river,Rāghava by means of arrows resisted the weaponsdischarged by the Yatudhānas. As a mighty mountain, assailedby the thunderbolt, doth not feel pain, Rāma, having hisperson pierced by terrible flaming weapons, did not feelpain. And pierced, and with his person covered with blood,Rāma, the descendant of Raghu, resembled the sunenveloped in evening clouds. And seeing him single,surrounded by many thousands, the Gods, Gandharbas,Siddhas, and supreme saints became sorrowful. Then Rāmagetting enraged, bringing his bow to a circle, dischargedsharpened shafts by hundreds and by thousands. And as ifin sport, Rāma in the conflict shot irrisistible (shafts)furnished with Kanka feathers, and decked with gold,irrisistible, capable of inflicting extreme pain, andresembling the noose of Death. And sportively discharged by Rāma,those arrows deprived the Rākshasas of their lives, like thenoose forged by death. And piercing the persons of theRākshasas, those arrows, soaked in blood, going up to thesky, appeared with the splendour of flaming fire. Andinnumerable shafts, exceedingly fierce, capable of depriving theRākshasas of their lives, were let go from the circle of hisbow. And with those Rāma severed bows, in battle byhundreds and by thousands and flag ends, and shields, andmail, and many arms with embellished hands, resembling thetrunks of elephants. And the arrows of Rāma dischargedfrom the string pierced and cut off steeds mailed in gold,yoked unto cars, together with the charioteer; and elephantswith their riders; and horsemen with horses. And slayingfoot-soldiers, he despatched them to the abode of Yama.And cut off with nālikas and, nārāchas, and sharp-pointedvikirnas, the rangers of the night uttered dreadful howls ofdistress. And like a withered wood afflicted by fire, thathost harassed by the various marrow-piercing36 shafts shot byRāma, did not attain ease. And some heroic rangers of thenight possessed of great strength, waxing furious, threw37 atRāma prasas, and darts and axes. Thereupon resisting bymeans of shafts those weapons of theirs, the mighty-armedRāma endeued with prowess, took their lives in the conflict,and cut off the heads (of warriors). And having their heads,and shields and bow-strings, severed, they fell as fall on theearth trees thrown down by blasts from the wings ofSuparna.38 Those rangers of the night that remained there,wounded by arrows, and losing heart, fled with speed toKhara, to seek his protection. Thereat, encouraging them,Dushana, taking his bow, ran furiously in high rage againstRāma, like the enraged Destroyer himself. And ralliedagain (by Dushana) and, their fear dispelled through theirhaving found refuge with him, they armed with sālas, tālas,and crags, darted against Rāma. And bearing in their handsdarts, and clubs, and nooses, those exceedingly strong onesshowered in battle shafts and weapons. And the Rākshasasdischarged vollies of trees and crags. And capable of makingone's hair stand on end, that battle was dreadful and furiousand now on the side of Rāma and now again on that ofthe Rākshasas. And waxing exceedingly wroth, they boreon him hard from all sides. Then finding all directionsentirely covered with Rākshasas, and showers of shafts, thatone gifted with mighty strength, sending up a terrific shout,fixed (on the bow-string) the exceedingly effulgent Gandharbaweapon (for discharging it) among the Rākshasas. Thenthousands of shafts went forth from the circle of his bow;and all directions were covered with thronging arrows. Andthose Rākshasas, afflicted with arrows could not see Rāmahow he took out his dread shafts, nor how he dischargedthose excellent shafts; they only saw him drawing his bow.And the darkness spread by the arrows enveloped the skywith the sun. And Rāma stationed there continued pouringin shafts. And the earth was covered with shafts shot, andalighting, and alighted simultaneously. And at places wereseen Rākshasas by thousands slain, falling, enfeebled, tornand riven. And cut off by Rāma with arrows, dartsand Patticas in that battle the fearful field wasscattered, heads with turbans, arms with finger-fences; torn thighsand arms, and various ornaments, horses, excellent elephantsand cars, shattered in numbers, chouris, fans, and umbrellas,and pennons of various descriptions.

And from all sides theyincessantly showered darts and patticas, and scimitars,stones, and trees, and shafts. Thereupon by means ofshafts the righteous Rāghava resisted that mighty destructiveshower of trees and stones. Resisting that shower, Rāmawith his eyes staring, and resembling a bull, flew into agreat rage, for the purpose of slaying the whole body ofRākshasas. Then influenced by wrath, and flaming in energyhe on all sides covered the army along with Dushana witharrows. Then the general, Dushana, destroyer of enemies,getting wroth, opposed Rāghava with arrows resemblingthunderbolts. Then heroic Rāma highly angered, severedhis (Dushana's) mighty bow with shafts sharp as razors,and slew his four horses by means of as many shafts. Andhaving slain the steeds, he (Rāma) cut off the head of thecharioteer by means of a crescent-shaped weapon, andpierced the (Rākshasa Dushna) in the breast with a brace ofshafts. His bow cut off, his steeds together with thecharioteer slain, and himself deprived of his car, he (Dushana)took a parigha resembling a mountain peak, able to makeone's down stand on end plated with gold, capable ofafflicting celestial hosts, studded with sharp iron sankus,and graced with the fat of foes;—of the touch of athunderbolt, able to pierce the persons of enemies.39 And takngup in that encounter the parigha resembling a mighty snake,that ranger of the night of cruel deeds Dushana, rushedtowards Rāma.

And the huge parigha escaping from(Dushana's grasp) fell forward on the field like the bannerof Sakra. And like a mighty elephant whose husks havefallen off, Dushana, on his arms having been severed, felldown to the earth. Seeing Dushana down on the ground,and slain in battle, all creatures, saying, \"well done!\" \"welldone!\" paid homage unto Kākutstha. In the meantime,three generals, getting wroth, being entrapped in the nooseof death, rushed against Rāma in a body—viz; Mahākapāla,Sthulākshya, and the mighty Pramāthi the Rākshasa,Mahākapāla, upraising a large dart, and Sthulākshya, taking apathica, and Pramāthi, an axe. And as soon as Rāghava beheldthem advance, he resisted them by means of sharp andkeen-edged shafts, even as one receives guests that have come. AndRaghu's son split Mahākapāla's head,—afflicted Pramāthi withcountless shafts, and lodged the eyes of Sthulākshya withsharp shafts. And they fell down to the earth like mighty treesof many boughs. Thereat instantly inflamed with wrath, Rāmaby means of five thousand shafts, sent as many thousands ofDushana's followers to Yama's abode. Hearing that Dushanahad been slain, Khara, waxing wroth, commanded his mightygenerals, saying, \"Fighting with that vile man, Rāma, alongwith his mighty forces Dushana hath been slain in battle,together with his followers. Let all the Rākshasas slay himwith weapons of various shapes.\" Having said this in wrath,Khara darted towards Rāma. And discharging choice shafts,Syenagāmi Prithugriva, Jajnasatru, Vihangama, Durjaya,Paravirāksha, Parusha, Kālakārmuka, Hemamāli, Mahāmāli,Sarpāsya, and Rudhirāçana,—these twelve generals endeuedwith mighty prowess accompanied with their forces, proceededvehemently against Rāma, discharging excellent shafts.Threat with shafts resembling fire, and decked with diamondsand with gold, (Rāma) possessed of energy destroyed the restof his (Khara's) forces. And as the thunderbolt slayeth themighty, Asuras, those shafts studded with gold, and like ontosmoking fire, slew those Rākshasas. And in in the field Rāmaslew an hundred Rākshasa with an hundred Karnis, and athousand (again) with a thousand. And, their armour andornaments severed, and their bows broken in shivers, thoserangers of the night fell down on the earth, bathed in blood.And as a spacious dais is covered with Kuça, the entire fieldwas scattered with the Rākshasas fallen in battle with hairdishevelled, and covered with blood. And at that time thatfearful forest, with the Rākshasas slaughtered, and with itsclay mired with flesh and blood, resembled hell itself.Fourteen thousand Rākshasas of dreadful deeds were slainby Rāma single, a human being, fighting, (moreover) on foot.And the remnant of his (Khara's) forces were that mightycar-warrior, Khara himself, and the Rākshasa, Triçira; and(on the other side) was that destroyer of foes—Rāma. Therest of the Rākshasas, gifted with great prowess, terribleand difficult of being withstood, were all slain in battle byThe dear brother of Lakshmana. Then seeing that dreadfularmy destroyed in terrible conflict by the mighty Rāma,Khara ascending a great car, advanced before Rāma, likeIndra with the upraised thunderbolt."

  "Āranya, Kishkindhā, and Sundara Kāndam": "As Khara was advancing before Rāma, that leader of thearmy named Triçira, approaching him, said, \"Do thouemploy me, who am possessed of prowess; and thyself desistfrom this rashness. Behold the mighty-armed Rāma broughtdown in battle. I swear (unto thee) truly; I touch thisweapon, (to say) that I will slay Rāma, who deserves to beslain by all the Rākshasas. Either I shall prove his deathin battle, or he shall prove mine. Restraining thy martialardour, do thou for a while become a witness. Either, joyedin consequence of Rāma being slain, thou shalt repair untoJanasthāna; or I being slain, thou shalt enter the field (againsthim).\" Thus satisfied by Triçara, from his desire to meetwith death, the latter, on being permitted with \"Go,\"proceeded towards Rāma. And like a hill with three summits,Triçira rushed towards Rāma on an effulgent car yoked withsteeds. And as a mighty cloud pours down shower, (Triçira)discharging vollies of shafts, uttered a roar resembling thesound of a wet kettledrum. And seeing that theRākshasa Triçira was advancing, Rāghava resisted (hisattack) by discharging sharpened shafts. And that encounterof those exceedingly powerful ones, Rāma and Triçira wasfierce, like unto that between a lion and an elephant. Thenstruck on the forehead by a brace of shafts shot by Triçira,the wrathful Rāma enraged, and inflamed with anger, said,\"Ah! such is the strength of the heroic Rākshasas! I havebeen wounded in the forehead with shafts resembling flowers.Do thou also take the arrows shot from my bow.\" Sayingthis, (Rāma) enraged, and influenced by wrath, woundedTriçira in the breast with fourteen arrows. And thatenergetic one by means of four shafts having their joints bent,brought down his four steeds. And by means of eight arrows(Rāma) laid low the charioteer from the front of the car.And Rāma with a shaft severed his upraised standard. Thenas that ranger of the night was descending from his brokencar, Rāma pierced his breast with arrows,—and thereat hewas stupified. Thereupon, that one of immeasurable prowess,out of anger by means of three shafts possessed of celerity,brought down Triçira's three heads. And that ranger of thenight present in the field, afflicted by the shafts of Rāma,after his heads had fallen first, fell, vomitting smoking gore.And the Rākshasas remaining after the rest had been slain,belonging unto Khara' s original forces losing heart, beganto flee like deer terrified at a hunter. And seeing them fly,Khara waxing wroth, swiftly making them desist, dartedtowards Rāma, like Rāhu darting towards the Moon."

  "Āranya, Kishkindhā, and Sundara Kāndam": "Seeing Dushana slain in fight along with Triçira, Khara,witnessing Rāma's prowess, was filled with fear. Andseeing that irrisistible Rākshasa host—even Dushana andTriçira—slain by the mighty Rāma alone, and seeing the greatcourage that was made in the army, that Rākshasa, Khara,was seized with despondency. Then as Namuchi advancesagainst Vāsava, Khara stretching his powerful bow, advancedagainst Rāma. And Khara hurled at Rāma nārāchasreveling in blood, resembling infuriated venomous snakes. Andrepeatedly twanging his bow, Khara, mounted on his car,began to range the field, displaying his weapons through hisacquired skill. And that mighty car-warrior covered allsides with his shafts. And seeing this, Rāma of atremendous bow with shafts incapable of being borne, and resemblingtongues of flaming fire, entirely enveloped the welkin, evenas a cloud poureth down showers. And with the sharpenedshafts shot by Khara and Rāma, the entire firmament on allsides was thronged. And as each enraged was engaged incoping with the other, the sun, enveloped in a net-work ofshafts, did not appear. And as a mighty elephant is struckwith the goad, Rāma in the conflict attacked (his opponent)with nālikas and nārāchas and sharp-pointed vikirna. Andas that Rākshasa sat on his car, bow in hand, all creaturessaw him, as if he were the very Destroyer with the noose inhis hand. And at this time Khara thought that Destroyer ofall his forces, established in his manliness, the exceedinglypowerful Rāma to be overcome with fatigue. And seeingthat one powerful like the lion, and gifted with the vigorousgait of the lion, Rāma was not moved, as a lion seeing apuny deer (is not moved). And then as an insect falls intoa flame, Khara mounting a mighty car, resembling the sun,approached Rāma. And, displaying his lightness of hand,Khara severed the bow of the magnanimous Rāma, with thearrow (fixed on it) at the place where it is grasped. Thentaking up seven other shafts, resplendent like thethunderbolt of Sakra, Khara, enraged, sent them into (Rāma's)main-joints, and then afflicting Rāma of unparalleled energywith a thousand shafts, Khara sent up in that conflicta loud shout. And riven by the shafts discharged byKhara, Rāma's mail resembling the sun fell to the ground.And pierced with those arrows, all over his body, andinflamed with rage, Rāghava appeared in the field, like asmokeless flaming fire. Then that destroyer of foes, Rāma,for compassing the end of his enemy, stringed anothermighty bow, sending forth solemn sounds,—the redoubtableVaishnava bow that had been conferred on him by theMaharshi. And uplifting that superior bow, Rāma rushedagainst Khara. Then with shafts having bent knots and goldenfeathers, Rāma, wrought up with rage, severed in battle Khara'sstandard. And on that exceedingly graceful golden standardbeing hewn down it seemed as if the sun dropped to theearth at the behest of the celestials. And thereat Khara,understanding the import of things, fired with wrath, piercedRāma's breast with five arrows, like one striking an elephantwith a goad. And Rāma on being pierced with a good manyshafts discharged from Khara's bow, and having his bodybathed in blood, was highly wroth. Thereupon that foremostof bowmen, and weilder of a mighty bow, taking six shafts,let them go, after aiming at them. And with one shaft hepierced Khara's head, with two his arms; and with threearrows headed like half-moons, Rāma wounded Khara in thechest. Then that highly energetic one, influenced by anger,assailed the Rākshasa with thirteen nārāchas whetted onstone and with one that exceedingly powerful one, cut theyoke of the car, with four the four steeds, with thesixth the head of Khara's charioteer, with three the stouttrivenu of the car, with two the wheel, and with the twelfth,severing as if in sport Khara's bow with his hand,40with the thirteenth, resembling the thunder-bolt piercedKhara in the encounter. Then with his bow shattered,deprived of his car, (Khara) having his horses slain as wellas his charioteer killed, taking a mace in his hand leapedto the ground, and stood there. And the celestials andMaharshis exceedingly rejoiced, assembled in the welkin ina body, and with joined hands extolled that feat of thatmighty car-warrior Rāma."

Even if one happen to be the lord of the threeworlds, one given to troubling creatures, and who is crueland engaged in wicked acts, can not exist. All personsdestroy, like a snake that hath intruded itself, him that dothcruel deeds, hostile to the interests of every one. Peopledelightedly behold the end of him that doing an action eitherfrom covetuousness or desire, doth not like a Brāhmainwallowing a Karakā, see the consequence thereof. What,O Rākshasa, dost thou gain by slaughtering exceedinglypious ascetics engaged in righteous acts, living in the forestof Dandaka? Like unto trees whose roots have been reduced,cruel persons, execrated of men, who perpetrate iniquitousacts, do not exist long. And as a tree puts forth blossomsin season, the doer of sinful deeds, at the hour (of repentance)inevitably reaps their fruit in the shape of dreadful anguish,of the spirit). And, O ranger of night, as the effect ofhaving taken rice mixed with poison, appears without delay,even so also people readily reap the fruit of their own acts.O ranger of the night, it is to take the lives of theperpetrators of dreadful sins, who wish ill unto men, that I the kinghave come. Today the gold-decked arrows discharged byme, piercing (thy body), shall enter into the earth, cleavingit, like serpents falling into an ant-hill. Slain in battle, thoushalt in company with thy army, follow those peoplepractising piety, whom thou hast devoured in the Dandaka forest.Today let those great saints, who had formerly been slain bythee, stationed in the sky, behold thee slain (in turn) with myarrows, and inhabiting hell. Do thou strike as thou lik.And thou that art of an odious race, do thou put forth thyenergy. Today I will bring down thy head, even as a palmfalls to the ground.\" Thus addressed by Rāma, Kharaenraged and beyond himself with passion, with eyes reddened,replied, \"O son of Daçaratha, why having slain inferiorRākshasas in battle, dost thou praise thyself without reason?Those foremost of men that are puissant and powerful, donot, inflated with their energy, mouth (their ownconsequence). It is the mean-minded Kshatriyas of impure headsthat magnify themselves among men, even as thouO Rāma, dost. What hero, when the hour of his death hathapproached, publishes in the field his own lofty lineage andsings his own hymn. As brass wearing the semblance ofgold, displays its own defect on being heated,41 with a firelit with Kuça,42 so thou hast betrayed thy own lightness bythis speech of thine. Thou dost not see me staying heremace in hand, like a moveless mountain dyed in metals,bearing mobile and immobile things. I can, mace in hand,deprive thee and the three worlds to boot clean of your lives,like the very Destroyer with the noose in his hand. But Iwill not parley much with thee as much as I could wish: thesun is going to set, and our fight shall be interrupted.Fourteen thousand Rākshasas have been slaughtered by thee. Iwill for their deaths wipe their tears to-day.\" Saying this,Khara, highly enraged, hurled his mace43 provided withgolden rings at Rāma, like unto the blazing thunder-bolt.Thereat, reducing to ashes trees and shrubs, that mightyflaming mace, discharged by Khara's arm, fell beforeRāma. And Rāma severed in many fragments that mightymace, resembling the noose of Death, as ascending thewelkin, it was coming down. Thereupon, like a she-serpentbrought down by force of incantations, the mace fell to theearth shattered and riven."

Rendered more nervelessat my hands, in vain dost thou storm. Riven by my shafts,thy mace, belonging unto thee who art prolix in the matterof vocabulary, destroying thy confidence, hath saught theearth. And what thou hadst said,—'I will wipe the tearsof the Rākshasas that have been slain,' hath also provedfalse. As Garuda stole ambrosia, will I deprive thee, ORākshasa, who art base, of a mean disposition and a falsecharacter, of thy life. To day the earth shall drink the bloodvitiated with foamy bubbles, of thee, having thy throatsevered, and riven by my shafts. Having all thy bodycovered with dust, and thy two arms lopped off, thou shalt,difficult to win, take thy nap, embracing the earth, like adamsel difficult to win. On thee, disgrace of Rākshasas,lying down, and being fast asleep, this Dandaka shall berefuge of those that shall resort to it for shelter. O Rākshasa,in thy Janasthāna, with its (Rākshasas) slain by my shafts,ascetics shall fearlessly go about in the wood. TodayRākshasas, capable of exciting fear in others, rendered forlornand with their friends slain, shall from fear, with their faceswet with tears, fly (this place).

Thou of a crueldisposition, thou of ignoble soul, thou that art aye a thorn (in theside) of Brāhmanas, it is for thee that ascetics, frightened anddispirited, have so long been pouring the clarified butter.\"As Rāghava, influenced by anger, said this in the field,Khara from wrath, with accents rendered harsher, fell tocensuring (Rāma). \"Thou art wondrous proud: and thouart fearless albeit fear is present unto thee. And comeunder the sway of death, thou dost not understand whatshould be said and what left unspoken. Those persons thathave been fast bound by the noose of death, do not inconsequence of their senses having ceased to perform theirfunctions, descern what is proper and what improper.\"Saying this unto Rāma, that ranger of the night (Khara),pursing his brows, espied a mighty sala hard by. Andlooking about him on all sides in the field for a weapon, heuprooted it, biting his nether lip. And raising up the treewith his arms, and uttering a roar, that exceedingly powerfulone aiming at Rāma discharged it, exclaiming,—\"Dead thouart.\" And as it descended, the puissant Rāma cut it off bymeans of a multitude of shafts, got into a mighty rage forthe purpose of slaying Khara in battle. Then Rāmaperspiring, with eyes reddened in wrath, pierced Khara in battlewith a thousand shafts. And blood mixed with froth gushedby the sides of the shafts, like torrents flowing from fountainin a hill44 stupified in battle by the shafts shot by Rāma, andmaddened by the smell of blood, Khara furiously made forRāma. And as he (Khara) was rushing on, bathed with blood,Rāma equipped with arms, suddenly summoning his strengthwalked backward two or three paces. Then with the viewof bringing about (Khara's end) Rāma took up in theconflict an arrow resembling fire or another weapon ofBrahmā himself. And that righteous one shot at Kharathat (arrow), which had been conferred on him by theintelligent Maghavān. And discharged by Rāma from hisbent bow that mighty arrow with the roaring of thethunderbolt fell at Khara' s breast. And burning in the fire of thearrow, Khara fell down on the earth, like the giant Andhaka45in the forest of Sweta, consumed by Rudra. And threat Kharaslain fell down like Vritra slain by the thunder-bolt, orNamuchi by foam,46 or Vala by Indra's Acani. After this, thecelestials, assembled with the Chāranas, struck with wonderjoyfully sounded kettledrums and showered blossoms onRāma. \"In over half a moment Rāma by means of sharpenedshafts hath slain in mighty encounter fourteen thousandRākshasas, wearing shapes at will, headed by Khara andDushana. Ah! mighty is the feat achieved by Rāma knowingself. Ah! this mighty prowess, this mighty firmness, showlike unto those of Vishnu himself.\" Saying this all thedeities went to from where they had come. Then the Rājarshisin company with supreme saints, with Agastya (at their head),gladly paying homage unto Rāma, said the following words,\"It is for this that the chastiser of Paka, the great Indra,Purandra, had paid a visit to the sacred asylum ofSarabhanga. And the Maharshis had dexterously broughtthee to this place, for compassing the destruction of thosefoes—the wicked Rākshasas. And it is owing to this, that,O son of Daçaratha, thou hast performed this mighty deed.(Now) the Maharshis will carry on their proper pious officesin the Dandaka.\" After this, that hero, Lakshmana,accompanied with Sitā came out of the mountain cavern, andjoyfully entered the asylum. Then the victorious and heroic,Rāma, honored by the Maharshis, entered the asylum,worshipped by Lakshmana. And seeing that destroyer offoes, and bringer of comfort unto the Maharshis, her husband,Vaidehi embraced him. And seeing the multitudesof Rākshasas slain, Janaka's daughter, beholding theundeteriorating Rāma, ministered unto him with supremejoy.

Who shall no morewend the way of all beings? Doing me a bad turn,Maghavan himself, or Vaiçravana, or Yama, or Vishnu, cannotattain happiness. I am the destroyer of the Destroyerhimself; and I burn even very Fire. And I can bring deathitself to mortality. I can by my impetus resist the force ofthe wind. And when enraged, I can by my energy consumethe Sun and Fire.\" Thereat, Akampana, with joined hands,from fear replied to the ten-necked Rāvana, in faltering words,beseeching courage. Thereat that foremost of Rākshasas,the ten-necked one, granted him courage. Then inspiredwith confidence, Akampana without fear spoke, \"There is ason of Daçaratha, youthful, resembling a lion47, named Rāmaof broad shoulders, and possessed of excellent beauty of longand mighty-arms. (He) is sable-hued, of high fame, and ofmatchless prowess and vigor. It is he that in Janasthānahath slain Khara with Dushana.\" Hearing Akampana'swords, that lord of the Rākshasas, Rāvana, breathing like amighty serpent, said these words, \"Tell me, O Akampana,hath Rāma come to Janasthāna, accompanied with thesovereign of the celestials and the body of the immortals? Againhearing Rāvana's words, Akampana described the strengthand energy of that high-souled one. (He) is named Rāma,and is exceedingly energetic; the foremost of all bowmen—furnished with celestial panoply; and is possessed ofpre-eminent prowess in warfare. Like unto him in strength, of redeyes, and gifted with a voice like the sound of a kettledrum,his younger brother, Lakshmana has a countenanceresembling the full-moon. He hath met with him (Rāma) as thewind meeteth with a flame. He is endeued with grace, andis the foremost of monarchs. It is he who hath ravagedJanasthāna. The magnanimous gods did not come there.No doubts need be entertained on this head. The featheredshafts, plated with gold near the plumed part, becomingfive-mouthed serpents ate up the Rākshasas. Whereveroppressed with fear the Rākshasas go, they see Rāmastationed before them. In this way, O sinless one, hathJanasthāna been exterminated by him.\" Hearing Akampana'swords, Rāvana said, \"I will go to Janasthāna for slayingRāma with Lakshmana.\" When he had said this, Akampanasaid, \"Hear, O king, the true report of Rāma's prowess andmanliness. Enraged, the highly famous Rāma cannot byputting forth vigor be checked. And by means of his shafts, hecan make river in full flood turn its course. And he can bringdown from the sky its stars and planets, and that gracefulone can recover the depressed Earth. And that lord cansubmerge all creatures by riving the continents of the sea, andwith his shafts can resist the onset of the ocean, and thewind; and that illustrious one that foremost of persons byvirtue of his vigor, destroying the worlds, can again createall creatures. O ten-necked one, forsooth, Rāma cannot besubdued in conflict, either by thee or the world of Rākshasas,as heaven is incapable of being attained by a sinner. Ideem him incapable of being slain by all the Gods andAsuras together. This alone is the means of slaying. Dothou heedfully listen to it! He has a wife of sterling worthin the world, and that slender-waisted one is known by thename of Sitā. She is in the full bloom of youth, and hath asymmetrical person—a jewel among womankindembellished with jewels. And neither a goddess, nor a Gandharbi,nor yet an Apsari, nor a Pannagi is equal to her; and whatis a human female? Thrashing him, do thou in the mightyforest, carry away his wife. Without Sitā, Rāma shall ceaseto exist.\" Thereupon, the lord of the Rākshasas, Rāvana,happened to relish those words; and reflecting (a while),that mighty-armed one addressed Akampana, saying, \"Excellentwell. I will go there alone, accompanied by my charioteeronly. I will this very morning with a glad heart bringVaidehi to this spacious palace.\" Saying this, Rāvanadeparted, lighting up all sides, on a sun-shiny car, yoked withmules. And coursing the firmament, that mighty car of thatforemost of Rākshasas looked like the Moon among clouds.And proceeding far, he, approaching the asylum (of Taraka'sson), presented himself before him. And Mārichaentertained the king with meats and drinks passing human. Andhaving entertained him personally with a seat and water (towash the feet), Māricha spoke these pregnant words, \"Oking, O lord of the Rākshasas, is it well with the worlds?I am filled with fear: I apprehend that all is not right, sincethou hast come hither (alone) in such post-haste speed.\"Thus addressed by Māricha, the highly energetic Rāvana,versed in speech, said, \"My child, the guards (of Janasthāna)have been slain by Rāma of untiring energy; and allJanasthāna, incapable of being slain, hath (by him) been broughtdown in battle. Do thou, therefore, assist me in carryingaway his wife.\" Hearing these words of the lord of Rākshasas,Māricha said, \"What enemy of thine in the guise of a friend,hath spoken of Sitā unto thee? And, O foremost ofmonarchs, who, having been, entertained by thee, doth not bearthee good will?48 Tell me, who is it that hath told thee,'Bring Sitā hither?' Who is it that hath set his heart onsevering the summit of the entire Rākshasa world? Hemust be thy enemy that excites thee to this. Of this thereis not the least doubt. He wishes to extract through thyagency the fangs of a venomous snake. Who (intends) tolead thee astray by imposing on thee such a deed? Who,king, hath struck in the head, thee that wast slumberingin peace? Rāghava in war is like a mad elephant, having anunblemished ancestry for his trunk, perspiration for histemporal exudation; and arms resting well beside him forhis tusks. O Rāvana, thou art not competent even to lookat him. Thou ought not to rouse up the sleeping man-lion,that slayer of skillful Rākshasas resembling deer, with hissport in the field, for his joints and down; arrows for hisbody and sharp scimitar for his teeth. O Sovereign of theRākshasas, thou ought not to plunge thyself into thisdreadful, and abysslesss ocean, having the bow for its alligators,activity of arms for its shine, arrows for its billows, andengagement for its waters. Be propitious, O lord of Lankā!O foremost of Rākshasas, with a contented heart, thou hadstbetter go thy way to Lankā. Do thou ever sport with thyown wives: let Rāma in company with his wife, sport in thewoods.\" Thus addressed by Māricha, the ten-throatedRāvana desisted, and entered Lankā the best of capitals."

Even as elephants shun the muddy river,do people shun from a distance, the ruler that doth not sendout spies, who showeth not himself (unto his subjects), andwho hath lost his independence. Like unto rocks in the sea,those monarchs that do not administer their dominions, thatare not dependent, do not prosper. Having incurred thehostility of the gods, the Dānavas and the Gandharbas ofsubdued souls and senses, how canst thou, who art fickle,and hast not employed spies, become the king? And, ORākshasa, thou art childish and foolish; and doth notknow what thou shouldst. How canst thou then becomethe king? O thou best of conquerers, those kings whosespies, exchequer and morality are not free, are like thecommon herd. It is because kings know distant dangersthrough spies, therefore they are styled far-sighted. I believethou hast no spies, and that thy counsellors are commonfolks, since although Janasthāna with thy kinsman isdestroyed, yet thou takest it not to heart. Fourteen thousands ofRākshasas of dreadful deeds, with Khara and Dushana, haveall been slain by Rāma single-handed; Rāma of untiringenergy hath inspired the saints with courage; the Dandakashave been benefitted; and Janasthāna hath been harassed.But thou, covetous and intoxicated and in the power ofothers, dost not understand that a great danger isoverhanging (thee). People do not in times of peril assist asovereign that is wrathful, stingy, intoxicated, haughty anddeceitful. Even his own kindred slay a sovereign that setsinmense store by his own self, is of light worth, regardshimself highly, and irascible. They do not serve him; nordo they fear when he intimidates them. Such an one isspeedily dethroned; and reduced to poverty and becomes like astraw. Even dry wood may serve a purpose; or stone, ordust; but no purpose is capable of being served by asovereign that hath been cast off his place. Like a cloth that hathbeen worn, like a garland that hath been trodden, a kingthat hath been dethroned, although able, is of noconsequence. But a king that keeps his wits about him,understands everything, is of controlled senses, and grateful, andof virtuous character, endureth for ever. That king is honoredby men, that sleeping with his eyes, is awake as respectshis eye of duty, and (the effects of) whose anger and favor,are seen (by all). But, thou Rāvana, who hast not by meansof spies, acquainted thyself with the slaughter of Rākshasas,art of evil understanding and bereft of all these virtues,given to disgracing others, ignorant of the properdistribution of time and place,50 and never taking care to distinguishmerits and defects, thou, thy kingdom being in danger, wiltspeedily meet with disaster.\" On his vices having been thuscelebrated by her (Surpanakhā), that lord of the rangers ofnight, Rāvana, musing awhile, was long plunged in thought."

And what his form?And what his power? And why hath he entered the forestof Dandaka, difficult to range? And what Rāma's weapons,by means of which he hath slain the Rākshasas? And Kharahath been slain in battle, and Dushana and Triçira. Dothou, O thou of a pleasing person, tell me the truth. Andwho hath deformed thee?\" Thus addressed by the lord ofthe Rākshasas, the Rākshasi, transported with rage,commenced to duly narrate all about Rāma. \"Rāma the son ofDaçaratha is long-armed, of expansive eyes, clad in bark anddark deer-skin, and like Kandarpa in grace. And drawinga bow resembling that of Sakra, decked with golden rings,he discharges blazing nārachas, like unto serpents ofvirulent poison. I do not see in the field, Rāma drawing hisbow: I only see the host being slaughtered by a shower ofshafts. And as Indra destroys (a field of) goodly crops, bypouring down hail stones, fourteen thousand Rākshasas ofdreadful prowess, as well as Khara and Dushana were in alittle over a moment slain with sharp shafts by Rāma alonefighting on foot. And he hath reassured the saints, andafter having been deformed, I alone from fear of slaying awoman, have been let off by the high-souled Rāma knowingself. His brother is endeued with mighty energy, and inmerit, is of equal prowess; and he is devoted to his brother,and beareth him regard; the puissant one is namedLakshmana. And wrathful and invincible and victorious, andpowerful, and intelligent and mighty, (he) is Rāma'sright-arm—his life ranging externally. And Rāma's virtuouslywedded beloved wife, having expansive eyes, and a faceresembling the full-moon, is ever to the welfare of her lord.And that fair-haired, fair-nosed, and fair-thighedillustrious one possessed of beauty, graceth the forest likea goddess,—as if a goddess of wealth herself. Of thelustre of burnished gold, with her finger nails reddishand projecting, and graceful, that surpassingly lovelywench is named Sitā—the slender waisted daughterof Videha. And neither a goddess, nor a Gandharbi, nora Yakshi, nor a Kinnari, had I seen before on earth,possessed of such beauty. He that shall have Sitā for hisspouse, and who shall be warmly embraced by her, shall livelonger in the world than the Lord of celestials himself.That good-natured girl, unparalleled on earth in loveliness,who can well pride herself on her person, is a worthy wifefor thee; and thou too art a fit husband for her. It is tobring over for thee that one of spacious hips, and a highand well-developed bust, that I had put forth myendeavours. But, O mighty-armed one I have been disfiguredby the wicked Lakshmana. As soon as thou hast seenVaidehi having a countenance resembling the full moon,thou shalt be afflicted with the shafts of Cupid. If itis thy purpose to have her for thy wife, at once stretch forththy right leg, for attaining success. If, O lord ofRākshasas, thou relishest my speech, do thou then, O Rāvana,without fear, do as I tell thee. Understanding theirincapacity, do thou, O lord of Rākshasas, for making her thy wife,by force carry away the frail Sitā of a blameless person.Hearing that Rāma by means of straight coursing shafts hathslain the Rākshasas that had gone to Janasthāna, and seeingKhara and Dushana, killed, do thou ascertaining thy course,adopt it."

Andproposing to himself that act, weighing its good and evil,considering his capacity or otherwise, and (finally)determining his purpose, Rāvana with a fixed mind went to thehandsome stable. And going to the stable in disguise, thelord of the Rākshasasas commanded the charioteer, saying,\"Yoke the car.\" Thus asked, the charioteer possessed offleet vigor, in a trice, yoked an excellent car after his heart.And ascending the car coursing at will, made of gold andgarnished with spectral faces as well as arrow decked withgold,—resembling a mass of clouds, the graceful ruler of theRākshasas—younger brother to the Lord of wealth—proceededin that noiseless (vehicle), past the lord of rivers and streams.And with chouris of white hair, and a white umbrella, havingten-faces, resembling (in hue) cool lapises, wearingornaments of polished gold, possessed of ten mouths, and twentyarms, clad in elegant apparel,—the foe of the celestials, andslayer of the foremost ascetics—having huge heads likeunto the monarch of mountains, the lord of the Rākshasas,mounted on that chariot coursing at will, appeared beautifullike a mass of clouds in the sky, with cranes, in the midstof lightning. And that one possessed of prowess beheldthe shore of the sea, containing crags, scattered with treesbearing fruits and flowers of various kinds by thousands,bordered all around with pools furnished with cool anddelightful waters, ornamented with spacious asylums havingdaises, graced with woods of plantain, beauteous withcocoanuts, and blossoming sāla and palmyra, and tamāla, trees,grateful with supreme saints rigidly restraining their fear,and with serpents and fowls of fair feathers and Gandharbasand Kinnaras by thousands; and pleasant with Siddhasand Chāranas, that have controlled their lust; with thosedescendants of Brahmā—the Vaikhanas, the Māshas, theVālakhilyas, and the Marichipas; swarming with females,divinely beautiful, dight with gorgeous ornaments andgarlands, and Apsarās skilled in sport, by thousands; frequentedby the wives of the celestials, and honored by graceful girls;ranged by multitudes of deities and Dānavas, feeding onambrosia; abounding with swans, Kraunchas, and frogs, echoingto (the cries of) cranes; containing stones resembling thelapis, and mild and cool by the influence of the ocean. And ashe proceeded, the younger brother of the Lord of wealth, sawon all sides spacious cars capable of coursing at will, sable,furnished with fair garlands, and resounding with trumpetnotes,—and Gandharbas and Apsarās. And surveying bythousands woods of sandal exuding gum at their roots,51and of choice aguru, grateful unto the sense of smell; andwoods and groves of excellent and odorous takkola fruits;blossoms of the Tamāla, and thickets of black pepper;heaps of pearls drying on the shore; rocks; the best coralsin masses;52 summits of gold and silver;53 charming pellucidrills at places; and cities filled with corn and wealth,abounding in gems of women, and thronged with horses,elephants and cars—Rāvana on the shore of the oceanbeheld around a level and soft scene, resembling heavenitself—where breezes of delicate feel kept breathing. Andthere he saw a fig tree, hued like clouds, surroundedby ascetics; its branches stretched around an hundredYoyanas, and the exceedingly powerful Garuda had ascendedone of its boughs, taking an elephant and a hugetortoise, for the purpose of devouring them. And that bestof birds, the powerful Suparna by his weight suddenly brokea branch containing full many leaves. And it came to passthat Vaikhānasas, Māshas, Vālakhilyas, Marichipas, Ayas,and Dhumras,—saints of the highest order—had assembledthere. Thereat, moved by commisseration (for the ascetics),the virtuous Garuda, taking with promptitude the brokenbough measuring an hundred Yoyanas as well as the elephantand the tortoise, by one leg, at length eating up the animals,and by means of the bough, exterminating the country ofthe Nishadas—that best of birds attained unequalled delightin consequence of having rescued the mighty ascetics.Thereat, attaining double energy by virtue of that delightthat intelligent one set his heart on bringing ambrosia. Andtearing off the iron links of the network, and bursting intothe repository of gem, he carried away secreted ambrosiafrom the residence of the great Indra. Kuvera's youngerbrother beheld this fig tree, named Subhadra, gracedwith the Maharshi, on which Suparna had left his mark.Then repairing to the other shore of that lord of rivers, theocean, Rāvana saw an asylum lying in the forest in acharming and sacred recess. And there he saw a Rākshasa, namedMāricha, clad in a dark deer-skin, bearing a head of mattedlocks, subsisting on restricted fare. And approachingRāvana duly, the Rākshasa, Māricha, received the king withevery hospitality passing human. And having entertainedhim personally with meats and drinks, Māricha addressedhim in weighty words, saying, \"O lord of the Rākshasas,king, is it well with thee in Lankā? And what for hast thouagain come hither so speedily?\" Thus addressed by Māricha,that highly powerful one, skilled in speech, Rāvana said."

Thou knowestJanasthāna, where lives my brother Khara, and the mighty-armedDushana, and my sister, Surpanakhā; as also that Rākshasasubsisting on (human) flesh, the long armed Triçira, andmany other heroic night-rangers besides, of high enthusiasmin battles—Rlkshasas, who had been living there at mycommand, troubling in the mighty forest the asceticscarrying on their pious offices. And fourteen thousands ofRākshasas of dreadful deeds, heroic, high-spirited,—Rākshasas possessed of exceeding prowess; while residingn Janasthāna of late,—clad in mail and equipped withvarious weapons, headed by Khara, met with Rāma in thefield. Getting enraged, Rāma in conflict without returningany harsh speech, by means of his shafts shot from his bow,—hath, a human being, and fighting on foot, with his flamingarrows slaughtered fourteen thousand Rākshasas of fierceenergy. And Khara hath been slain in battle, and Dushanaalso hath been brought down. And having slain Triçiratoo, (Rāma) hath rid the Dandaka of all fear. Having beenexpelled by his enraged sire, that disgrace of Kshatriyas, theweak Rāma, living in company with his wife hath effectedthe destruction of this army. He is of a vile character,crabbed, foolish, covetuous, of uncontrolled senses, bereftof morality, sinful, and ever engaged in the evil of allcreatures,—by whom, violently without hostility my sister hathbeen deformed in the forest by having her nose and ears cutoff. Of him will I carry off by force from Janasthāna, hiswife, Sitā, resembling the daughter of a celestial. Be thoumy help in it. For certain, O exceedingly strong one, if thouhelp me at my side, if my brothers also back me, I do notthink much of all the celestials. Therefore, be thou my help;for, thou art capable, O Rākshasa. In prowess in battle, andin indomitableness, there is none like thee. Thou art amighty hero commanding resources, and conversant withpotent illusory displays. Taking this to my heart, I havecome to thee, O ranger of the night. Do thou listen as tothe business in which by my command thou art to help me.Becoming a golden deer, marked with silver spots, do thourange about in Rāma's asylum in presence of Sitā. Seeingthee helpless, in the shape of a deer, Sitā will say unto herlord and Lakshmana also,—\"Do ye catch it.\" And whenthey shall have departed, I shall carry off from theempty asylum, Sitā without let, like Rāhu depriving theMoon of his splendour. Then when Rāma shall be soreafflicted because of the carrying off of his wife, I shall easily,crowning my soul with success, safely bear away Sitā.Hearing Rāma's words, the face of the high-souled Mārichabecame blank and he was seized with apprehension. Andlicking up his dried lips, with winkless eyes, (Māricha) as ifdead, and exceedingly distressed, eyed Rāvana, steadily.And alarmed because of Rāvana, with his mind depressed,Māricha who well knew Rāma's prowess in the forest, withjoined hands in agitation spoke words lending to his ownas well as Rāvana's welfare."

Volatile, and employingno spies, thou surely dost not understand the exceedinglypowerful Rāma towering high in virtues, and resemblingthe illustrious Indra or Varuna himself. I shall be well, mychild, if Rāma fired with rage, do not render all the worldbereft of Rākshasas; if Janaka's daughter hath not sprungto compass thy destruction, if a dreadful disaster do notbefall thee because of Sitā, and if having obtained for herlord thee that art wilful and wicked, the city of Lankā withthee and the Rākshasas do not meet with utter extermination.The sovereign who is wicked, whimsical and of evil intentlike thee, bringeth about his own destruction as well as that ofhis kingdom and relatives. Rāma, the enhancer of Kauçalya'sdelight hath not been abandoned by his father, nor is hedevoid of propriety of conduct; he is not avaricious, wickednor the destroyer of Kastriya race. He does not lackreligious merits or accomplishments, nor is he of a harshtemperament and intent on causing misery unto creatures.Finding his truthful sire imposed on by Kaikeyi hehas sojourned unto woods. For compassing thewelfare of his father Daçaratha and Kaikeyi he hath enteredthe forest of Dandaka. Rāma, O my child is not harsh orfoolish; nor has he not control over his senses. Far fromspeaking untruth he does not know false stories even. It dothnot behove thee therefore to use such improper languagetowards him. He is an incarnation of virtue, pious andtruthful, and lord of all men as Bāsava of all celestials. Howdost thou then wish to carry away by force his Vaidehi,protected by virtue of her own chastity, like unto the rays ofSun? It doth not behove thee to enter that fire of Rāma whohath arrows for rays and bow and scimitar for fuel. It dothnot behove thee, O Rāvana, to approach Rāma renouncingthy kingdom, happiness and love of life, who is like untodeath itself and has bow for his widened and flaming mouth,and arrows for his rays and who is irrepressible, of mightyprowess, holding bows and arrows and repulsing the forcesof the enemy. Incomparable is his power; daughter ofJanaka is his wife and lives in the forest confiding in themighty strength of his bow; thou shalt not be able to carryher away. She is the beloved wife of that best of menhaving a leonine chest—and he holds his wife dearer than hislife and is ever attached unto her. And young Sitā belovedof the mighty Rāma, and like unto the rays of flaming fireis ever incapable of being carried away by thee. Of what availis this vain attempt O Rākshasa chief? No sooner Rāmashall see you in the battle thou shalt meet with thy end.Hard it is to attain life, happiness and kingdom, so it behoveththee to act properly, after consulting with thy ministersheaded by Bivishana, judging Rāma's merits and demeritsand ascertaining his and thy own strength and as well asthy welfare. Methinks thy approaching conflict with the sonof the Koçala chief forebodes no good unto thee; hear againtherefore O prince of the night-rangers, words sensible andlending to thy welfare."

I had parigha in my hands,crown on my head and golden ear-rings on my ears and mybody was of a dark blue colour like that of a cloud. Causingfright unto the people I used to wander through the forestof Dandaka and live upon the flesh of the Rishis. Thepious ascetic Viswamitra being afraid of me went in personto the king Daçaratha and said, \"When I shall remainabsorbed in meditation on the occasion of parva, let Rāmaprotect me O king, Truly am I afraid of this Māricha.\"Being thus addressed by the ascetic the virtuous-souled kingDaçaratha replied, saying \"Rāghava is still under twelveyears of age and hath not been well disciplined in military arts.But I have soldiers enough, and if permitted by thee, O thoubest of ascetics, I shall with my four-fold forces kill thyenemies, the rangers of the night.\" Being thus addressedthat ascetic spoke unto the monarch, saying, \"True it is thatthou wert the protector of the celestials in the War andthy exploits are well known to the world, but no one shallbe able to withstand the Rākshasas but Rāma. The highlyenergetic Rāma, though a boy is sufficiently qualified todefeat the enemies; therefore, O Destroyer of foes, let thysoldiery remain here and let me proceed along with Rāma.May God bless thee.\" Saying this the ascetic Viswamitrabeing pleased went to his asylum along with Rāma.Afterwards having been initiated for the sacrifice in the forestof Dandaka Rāma having unstrung his mighty bow cameto the ascetic to protect the sacrifice. He had a gold chainround his neck, a crest on his head and a bow in his hands;he had a pair of beautiful eyes, and only one piece of cloth;his countenance was of green hue and exquisite beauty andeven then mustaches or other signs of manhood did notappear on his face. Beautifying the entire forest of Dandakawith his own splendour Rāma appeared like the newlyrisen moon. Thereupon I resembling a cloud and havinggolden ear locks entered the asylum being proud of mypower on account of the boons offered unto me by Brahmā.Seeing me enter he took up his dart and attached stringunto his bow with proper care. Being under the influenceof sheer foolishness I passed by him as a child and dartedtowards the sacrificial altar of Viswamitra. Thereupon hewounded me with a sharpened sword capable of doing awaywith the enemies and threw me away into the ocean situatedat a distance of hundred yojanas. He had no mind ofkilling me then and for this he saved my life. I wasthrown however into the deep ocean being hindered by thevelocity of his arrows and having lost myconsciousness. Regaining my sense after a long while I returnedthe city of Lankā. Myself saved thus, my followers howeverwere all killed by Rāma of unwearied activity though a merechild and a novice in the art of warfare. It is for this thatI do prevent thee; thou shalt be overwhelmed with calamitiesand meet with destruction if dost thou engage thyself inbattle with him. In vain shalt thou bring about the afflictionof the mirthful and sportive Rākshasas ever witnessingsocial festivities. And in vain shalt thou for Sitā compassthe destruction of the city of Lankā, adorned with diversejewels and filled with golden edifices. Pious men livingwith a vicious man, meet with destruction for his sins, thoughthey themselves do not commit any misdeed, like unto fish(devoured by Garuda) living in a lake where snakes dwell.Thus shalt thou witness that for thy own folly the rangersof the night, adorned with celestial ornaments and havingtheir body pasted with sandal, have been killed and broughtdown to the earth. And they deprived of shelter havefled away to different directions, some with their wives andsome alone, having their wives carried away (by the enemies).Thou shalt further observe that all edifices of Lankā, beingenveloped with arrows and flaming fire have been burntdown to ashes. There is no greater sin on earth thancarrying away another's wife. There are a thousand ladies inthy seraglio O king. Being attached unto thy wives dothou preserve the race of the Rākshasas, thy own line, thywished for life, kingdom, wealth and dignity. Do notbring about Rāma's mischief if dost thou wish to live happilywith thy wives and friends. I am thy friend and do askthee again and again to desist (from thy evil intentions);if dost thou encroach upon Sitā surely shalt thou along withthy kinsmen go to the abode of Yama being enfeebled by thearrows of Rāma.\""

Once again I entered theforest of Dandaka accompanied by two Rākshasas assumingthe shape of deer. I had a flaming tongue, huge teeth,sharpened horns and lived on the flesh of ascetics.Assuming such a terrible appearance I began to traverse withgreat vehemence the Tirtha, Agnihotri and the place ofworship; eating the flesh and drinking the blood of theascetics after killing them I began to hinder all religiousservices. I had a most ugly figure and was maddened withdrinking blood, and all the animals of the forest wereexceedingly frightened at me. White I was thus traversingthe forest of Dandaka throwing obstacles in the way ofreligious services I saw the pious ascetic Rāma living ona restricted fare, the honored Sitā and the mighty Lakshmana,taking recourse to asceticism, moderate in eating and everengaged in the welfare of created beings. Remembering hisformer enmity and aggrandisement, I, being extremelywrathful, in my deer shape and with my sharpened horns, dartedtowards him with a view to kill him, considering throughmy ignorance the effulgent Rāma as none other but anascetic living in the forest. Then stringing his huge bow hedarted three sharpened arrows at me. Those three terriblearrows with bent knots resembling thunder-bolts, killingenemies and drinking blood and having the motion of Garudaand air, coalescing with each other came before us. Wickedas I am, I was fully aware of his prowess having beenfrightend by him on a former occasion, and so I saved myself byescaping, but those two Rākshasas were killed. O Rāvana,any how saved from the arrows of Rāma and having gotmy life back I have resorted to the life of an ascetic andhave been carrying on asceticism here being absorbed inYoga."

Surely shall I before thee take away fromthat Rāma the destroyer of Khara his favourite wife, at whosewords he has sojourned into woods renouncing his fathermother, kingdom and friends.

Vaidehi, beingstruck with wonder seeing thee a golden deer capable ofillusions, shall request Rāma to get thee soon for her.Kākuthstha issuing out of the asylum, thou shalt, atgreat distance utter such cries as \"O Sitā, O Lakahmana\"imitating his (Rāma's) voice. Hearing those cries Lakshmanaalso, at the behest of Sitā, shall proceed to Rāma. Whenboth Rāma and Lakshmana shall go elsewhere in this wayI shall to my felicity carry away Vaidehi like unto thethousand-eyed deity carrying away Sachi. O Rākshasa, dothou go wherever thou likest after doing this. I shall conferon thee, O Māricha, half of my kingdom. O thou ofauspicious look, do thou proceed towards the forest of Dandakato compass this end of mine; I shall follow thee in mychariot. Acquiring Sitā without any conflict, after imposingupon Rāma I shall return to Lankā successful along with thee.I shall kill thee, O Māricha, if dost thou not obey my behest.I shall compell thee to do this. No body can attain toprosperity and happiness, acting against his sovereign's will.Truly shalt thou risk thy life if thou approachest Rāma, butthou shalt meet with sure destruction if dost thou act againstmy will .

But those objects are never attained O Rāvana whenthey are not in good odour with their sovereign; moreover thesubjects meet with dangers when he is devoid of all qualities.O thou the best of conquerors, the king is the root of virtueand fame unto the subjects; he should therefore be alwaysprotected by them. O ranger of night, proud kings of crueltemperament, acting against the subjects can neveradminister their kingdoms. So do the ministers of cruel counselmeet with their end like unto a chariot driven into a wild trackby an unskilled charioteer. Many a pious person, on thisearth, ever engaged in the performance of religious services,have, for the folly of other persons, met with destructionalong with their relatives. Verily the subjects, O Rāvana,can never expect to prosper under the regime of hot-naturedsovereigns acting against their subjects like unto deer underthe protection of a jackal. All the Rākshasas shall surelydie, O Rāvana whose lord art thou, foolish, cruel and underthe control of thy passions. I shall not be the least sorryif I do meet with a sudden accident—what I do deplore mostis that thou shalt meet in no time with destruction alongwith thy soldiery. Compassing my end Rāma shall enterminatethee in no time—and blessed I shall be being killed by anenemy in the conflict. Surely dost thou know that no soonershall I see Rāma I shall be done away with; thou shalt carryingaway Sitā meet with thy end along with thy kinsmen.And if dost thou bring Sitā with me from the asylum,none shall be saved,—me, thyself, the city of Lankā, and theRākshasas. Thou dost not relish my words O ranger of thenight though prevented by me, who wishes thee welfare;those men who range on the verge of death, well-nigh finishingthe term of their existence do not receive with good gracethe counsels of friends."

Surely shall I bedeprived of my life by him (Rāma) taking up his scimitarand having a bow and arrows in his hands, if I go beforehim again. Meeting with his prowess thou shalt never returnwith thy life; he is like the noose of Death unto thee thoughthou hadst baffled its power. Thou art vicious-souled, what canI do for thee? Be thou crowned with success O ranger of thenight, I shall go.\" The Lord of Rākshasas being pleasedwith Marietta's words embraced him warmly and said, \"Thisis worthy of thy heroism that thou hast addressed thyself toact after my desire. Thou wert another Rākshasa beforeand hast now become true Māricha. Do thou now with meascend this chariot coursing in the air, crested with jewelsand driven by asses having faces of a demon. EnchantingVaidehi thou shalt wend thy way and away shall I carry thedaughter of the king of Mithilā by force (when there shallbe neither Rāma nor Lakshmana by her.)\" ThereuponTāraka's son assented to Rāvana's words, and both of themascending the chariot like unto a heavenly car set out forthe hermitage. And beholding diverse towns, forests,mountains, rivers, kingdoms and cities they reached the forestof Dandaka and the asylum of Rāma. And descending nowfrom the golden car the lord of Rākshasas together withMāricha beheld Rāma's asylum. Taking him (Māricha) bythe hand Rāvana spake saying \"There stands the asylum ofRāma surrounded by palm trees. Do thou do that for whichwe have come here.\" Hearing the words of Rāvana, theRākshasa Māricha assuming the wonderful shape of a(golden) deer began to range at large before Rāma'shermitage. The points of its horns were like unto (two) excellentjewels, its countenance was diversified with white and blackcolour, its face was like a red lotus, its ears were like untotwo blue lotuses, its neck was little raised, its belly was likea saphire, its sides were like unto Madhuka flowers, itscolor was like that of a filament of a lotus, its hoops were likeunto Baidurjas (a gem of a dark color); of lean thighs;of firm joints; its tail having the diversified color of arainbow was upraised. It was of a pleasant and cool hueand crested with various jewels."

To tempt Vaidehi that ranger of the night,assuming a beautiful countenance painted with diversemetals, illumining the beautiful forest and Rāma's asylumwith its beauty, and ranging at large on the green field andliving on grass, began to proceed. That one of livelypresence having its body painted with hundreds of silverdrops and living on twigs of trees began to range in theforest. Sometimes walking into the plantain house,sometimes walking around the forest of Karnikā, sometimescoming within the compass of Sitā's vision, that best ofdeer having its back painted with gold began to rangeslowly around the hermitage. It began to walk at pleasurenear Rāma's asylum. Sometimes going, sometimesstopping, at one time running very swiftly and receding the nextmoment, that best of deer began to range at large.Sometimes playing around, sometimes lying on earth andsometimes following the deer-herd having come within thethreshhold of the asylum and then followed again by themthat Rākshasa assuming the form of a deer came backto see Sitā. He then began to range at large in thebeautiful forest (extending far and wide). Seeing him otherforest-deer came (by him) and smelling him fled away intodifferent quarters. That Rākshasa, though expert in killingdeer, did not eat them up, though touching, inorder to hidehis real self. In the meantime Vaidehi, of auspicious lookswhose eyes inebriate like wine, being engaged in pluckingflowers, was going sometimes to the Karnika grove andsometimes to the mangoe grove. That best of women, everinured to living in the forest and possessed of a gracefulcountenance, walking and plucking flowers, saw thatjewelled deer, having its body deversified with pearls anddiamonds. It had beautiful teeth and lips and had its downresembling silver. She began to behold with affection andwith her eyes expanded with surprise. That illusive deerseeing Rāma's wife began to move around as if lighting upthat forest (with the fire of its beauty). Beholding that deerornamented with diverse jewels, and the like of which shehad never seen before, the daughter of Janaka was struckWith immense wonder."

Being thus called bythe daughter of the king of Videha those two best of menRāma and Lakshmana, casting their looks around beheld thatdeer. Seeing him Lakshmana, struck with fear, said\"Methinks, this deer is the Rākshasa Māricha. This viciousMāricha, O Rāma, assuming the shape of a deer oftentimeskills at pleasure the kings who come here a-hunting. Heis cognizant of illusions, by virtue of which he has assumedthis shape, O best of men; its countenance is perfectly finelike the abode of Gandharbas and resplendent like the Sun;there is no such jewelled deer on earth. O Rāghava, O Lordof earth, there is no doubt that this is nothing but illusion.\"When Lakshmana spake thus Sitā with a pure smile beingunder the influence of enchantment contradicted him, andbeing pleased said \"O son of the worshipful Sire, this deerhath attracted my mind, get it for me, pray, O thou of mightyarms; it shall be an object of sport for us. Many abeautiful deer range at large in the vicinity of our hermitage suchas Chamara, Srimara, Rik, Prishata, Bānara, and Kinnara.They are all very beautiful and of mighty strength; but OPrince, I have never seen before the like of this deer. Inenergy, strength and beauty it stands above all deer. Itsentire body is diversified with various colors, nay, it is a jewelitself. It moves before me, beautifying the forest withits resplendance, like unto Moon himself. Ah! what beauty,what beautiful a lustre, how musical a voice, thiswonderful deer of variegated countenance, hath indeedcaptivated my heart! If canst thou get by this deer alive, Owhat wonder, what surprise! When shall we regain ourkingdom after the expiry of the term of our banishment, thisdeer shall beautify the interior of our palace. O Lord, trulyshall this celestial deer create surprise in Bharata,yourself, me and my mothers-in-law. O best of men, if canstthou not get hold of it alive its skin shall also look verybeautiful (to us). Spreading on Kuça the skin of this goldendeer when killed do I wish to invoke the Almighty. It looks(no doubt) unseemly and terrible and smacks of wilfulnesson the part of a wife to command her husband in this way,but I am sunk in surprise seeing the countenance of thedeer.\" Rāma's heart was struck with surprisebeholding that wonderful deer having its down resemblinggold, horns resembling exquisitely fine diamonds, colorlike that of the newly risen Sun, and resplendance likethat of the orbit of the planets. Being enchanted byits beauty and spurred on by Sitā's words, Rāghavapleased, spake unto his younger brother saying \"Behold, OLakshmana, it has immensely excited Vaidehi's desire. Onaccount of its exquisite beauty it shall loose its life to-day.It has its equal no where on the earth—neither in thecelestial garden nor in the Chaittraratha forest. The hairs ofits body being arranged in regular and contrary courses andbeing painted with golden drops do indeed look verybeautiful. Do thou see, while expanding its mouth, its tonguecomes out resembling flaming fire like unto a thunder-boltreaving the mass of clouds. Its face is like a glass made ofbest blue saphire, its belly resembling a conch and pearl,and it is very difficult to ascertain its shapes. Beholding itwho is there (on earth) whose heart is not enamoured? Itsbeauty resembles the rays of gold and is variegated withdiverse hues of jewels. Whose heart is not enveloped withsurprise beholding such a celestial beauty, O Lakshmana?Princes, with bows in their hands, while-a hunting ina deep forest destroy deer either for flesh or for sport.Moreover while engaged in sporting they collect manya jewel and various metals as gold and silver, in thewoods. There is not the least doubt that these wild richesfilling up their coffers are comparatively far better (thanthe wealth acquired by other sources) like unto the objectsof enjoyment, enjoyed at their fancy by the people inhabitingthe celestial region. The object which persons desirous ofacquiring wealth follow without any discretion in theiractions, is the true definition of wealth given by the politicaleconomists. Vaidehi of slender waist desireth to sit with meon the exquisitely fine golden skin of this gem of a deer,meseems no deer skin is so comfortable to touch as this—neitherthe skin of Kādali, Priaki, Prabeni nor of Abiki. Trulyhandsome in this deer and the one that rangeth in thewelkin, indeed these two deer only are celestial—the one thatrangeth in the sky54 (Mrigashirā) and this that rangeth onearth. And if it be a Rākshasa's illusion as thou sayest, OLakshmana, then it must be killed by me. This cruelvicious-souled Māricha made away with many eminentascetics, while traveling in the forest; and this Rākshasaassuming the shape of an illusive deer destroyed many kings—mighty archers while a-hunting in this forest; it is for thisthat this deer must be killed. Formerly this Bātapi55 enteringinto the womb of twice-born ones used to come out reavingthem like unto the embryo of a mule. Once on a timethis Bātapi approached the eminent saint Agastya andwas devoured by him. After the Sradha ceremony hadbeen over, finding that Bātapi desirious of assumingthe shape of a Rākshasa the great saint Agastya saidsmiling \"Being blinded with thy prowess O Bātapi, thouhast destroyed many eminent twice-born ones on this earthand for this that I do digest thee. Truly that RākshasaO, Lakshmana, who wisheth to surpass one like me who hathcontrolled his senses and is ever engaged in pious officesshall meet with his end like unto this Bātapi. Thereforethis Māricha approaching me shall be killed by me like untoBātapi being devoured by Agastya. Do thou thereforevigilently protect Vaidehi with mail and armours on. It is ourprime duty, O descendant of Raghu, to protect Jānaki. I shalleither kill this deer or shall get hold of it. Look, OLakshmana, Vaidehi is extremely anxious to get the skin ofthis deer, I shall therefore proceed at once, O son of Sumilto catch this deer. The skin of this deer is the best of itskind; for certain shall it loose its life today. As long as I donot kill this deer, O Lakshmana, do thou with Sitā remainwith vigilance in this asylum. I shall in no time come backwith its skin after killing it with one arrow. Do thou stayhere, O Lakshmana, with Jānaki in constant fear andvigilance, along with the mighty Yatāyu, intelligent and eengaged in pious offices."

Seeing that foremostof monarchs approach, that best of beasts from feardisappeared; and then again showed himself. Thereatgirt with the bow and sword, (Rāma) rushed where the deerwas; and beheld him illumining all before him with hisbeauty,—and bow in hand (Rāma beheld) him in that vastforest, darting away after gazing at him,—and sometimesseeming to have got beyond arrow range, and at otherstempting Rāma (by his vicinity). And sometimes influencedby fear and bewildered, (the deer) seemed to course thewelkin; and in the forest now he became visible andnow vanished from sight. And like the autumual lunar discenveloped by indented clouds, he momentarily showedhimself, and anon discovered himself at a distance. AndMāricha wearing the shape of a deer, showing himself anddisappearing from sight, drew Rāghava a long way fromthe hermitage. Thereat Rāma, eagerly anxious to securethe deer, being foiled by the deer, and in consequencegrowing enraged, wearied out, rested under a shadow, on asward. And that ranger of the night, wearing the form ofa deer, maddening Rāma, discovered himself (again) at adistance surrounded by (other) deer. And Rāma desirousof taking (the beast), seeing him again, set off at speed. Atthe very moment the deer disappeared from fear; and againshowed himself at a distance behind a tree. And seeing him,the exceedingly energetic and strong Rāghava, determinedto slay him, growing wroth, taking out a flaming shaft,resembling the rays of the sun, powerfully drew his bow, andfirmly setting the shaft, and aiming it at the deer, let gothe blazing and burning weapon forged by Brahmā,resembling a flaming serpent. And that best of arrows, like untoa thunderbolt, deeply pierced the breast of Māricha, wearingthe shape of a deer. Thereat bounding up high as a palmyrapalm, that one whose saws had almost run out, utteredterrible sounds, lying on the earth. And while on the pointof death, Māricha renounced his counterfeit shape. Andremembering the words of Rāvana, the Rākshasa reflected,\"By what means can Sitā send away Lakshmana, and Rāvanacarry off Sitā staying in solitude?\" And pierced to themarrow by that peerless shaft, Māricha, renouncing his deerform, resumed his Rākshasa lineaments; and giving up hislife attaining a huge person, considering the time had come(for availing himself of the advice tendered by Rāvana),began to cry with the voice of Rāghava, \"Ah Sitā! AhLakshmana!\" And seeing that grim-visaged Rākshasalying low on the ground, with his person bathed in blood,and rolling hither and thither, Rim a proceeded towards theasylum, thinking of Sitā. and revolving within himselfLakshmana's words. While returning he thought aside\"Lakshmana said before that this was Māricha's illusion!\"His words have been verified now. Truly have I killedMāricha. Māricha has given up his ghost exclaiming aloudAh! Sitā, Ah! Lakshmana. I do not know what shall Sitādo hearing the cry? And what shall the mighty-armedLakshmana do?\" While pondering thus the hairs of thevirtuous-souled Rāma stood on their end. Killing thatRākshasa assuming the shape of a deer and hearing histerrible cry Rāma was overwhelmed with fear arising out ofsorrow.

It behoveththee to save thy brother who is crying aloud in the forest;do thou immediately repair hence to save him, who is inneed of thy help.

Celestials, Dānavas, Gandharbas, Rākshasas,Picachas, men, Kinnaras, animals, or birds, there is noneamong them, who can withstand Rāghava, who equals thelord of celestials in warfare. In fact there is none who cando away with Rāma in battle. It doth not behove theetherefore to accost me thus. Nor do I dare leave thee herealone in this forest without Rāma.

Do thoutherefore renounce grief and console theyself. Sooner shallthy husband return killing the best of deer. It is not hisvoice nor one sent by any deity. It is but an illusion of thatRākshasa (Māricha). O Vaidehi, thou hast been left unto mycharge by the high-souled (Rāma)—I therefore do not dareleave thee behind, O thou the jewel of a damsel.

For compassingthe destruction of Khara, O worshipful one, and devastatingJanasthāna, Rākshasas oftentimes use improper wordsunto us in this extensive forest. O Vaidehi, to createmischief unto the pious is the only amusement of theseRākshasas—thou shoudst not therefore be anxious for this.\"Being thus addressed by him her eyes were reddened withire, and she spake these harsh words unto the truthfulLakshmana saying \"O cruel one! O thou the destroyer of thyline! it is a disgrace unto thee that thou wishest to protectme (killing Rāma). Methinks, this mighty disaster of Rāmais welcome unto thee, or else why shouldst thou seeing this,speak thus, O Lakshmana. It is not a wonder that an evildesire lurks in thee who art a hypocrite and a cruel-heartedenemy. Verily art thou a monster of wickedness, thatRāma repairing unto woods, thou hast, being lustful for me,followed him alone. Or hast thou been engaged by Bharatato act thus? But thy or Bharata's intention shall not besatisfied, O Saumitre. How shall I desire another man afterserving the lotus-eyed Rāma of dark blue hue as my husband?I shall renounce my life before thee, therefore, O Lakshmana;without Rāma I shall not maintain my being for a momenton this earth.\" Hearing these brazen words of Sitā,capable of making one's down stand on end, theself-controlled Lakshmana with joined hands spake unto her saying\"Thou art a very Goddess unto me, I therefore dare notanswer thee. What thou hast spoken, O Maithelee, is nothingsurprising for females. Such is the nature of womankindon this earth. Women by nature are crooked, fickle, devoidof religious knowledge, and bring about difference betweenfather and son.

Thereupon the ten-necked one,availing of this opportunity came before Vaidehi assumingthe semblance of a mendicant. Wearing a soft silken cloth,with a lock of hair on his head with an umbrella and shoesand having on his left shoulder a rod and Kamandalu, thehighly powerful one assuming the appearance of a wanderingdevotee carrying three long bamboo staves appeared beforeVaidehi in the forest when there was none of the brothers byher. He saw there the young and pious daughter of the kinglike unto an evening void of both sun and moon and asthe highly terrible Rāhu eyes Rohini forsaken by Moon.Seeing that terrible one the doer of evil deeds, the trees ofJanasthāna did not move nor the wind did blow. Seeinghim eye Sitā with his blood-red eyes, the fast streamingriver Godaveri even slackened its course out of fear. In themean time the Ten-necked Rāvana, enquiring about Rāma'sweak points appeared before Vaidehi in the guise of amendicant. Like unto Sani approaching chitra, that impiousone, assuming the appearance of a pious man like a wellcovered with grass, approached Vaidehi who was bewailingher husband. And seeing that pious spouse of Rāma—Vaidehi,Rāvana stood before her. Her lips and teeth wereextremely fine, her face resembled the full moon and her eyeswere like lotus-petals. She had a yellow silken cloth onand sat in the thatched cottage, overwhelmed with grief andbathed in tears. And that ranger of the night with a pleasedheart approached Vaidehi. Seeing her that Lord of Rākshasaswas pierced with the shafts of passion. And speaking highlyof her, surpassing in beauty the three worlds and resemblingby the excellence of her own person the very goddessof wealth herself Rāvana uttering the name of God spakeunto her saying, \"O thou having the color of goldand silver, O thou wearing silken cloth, O thou appearinglike a lotus wearing a garland of lotus-petals, O thouof beautiful countenance! Art thou Bashfulness, Beauty,Fame, Wealth, Apsara, Dignity or Rati herself who isranging at will in this forest? All thy teeth are equal havingtheir tops like unto the buds of Kunda flower, beautiful andyellow. Thy eyes are expansive, clear, of bloody hue,and having black pupils. Thy hip is fleshy and spacious.Thy thighs are like those of elephants, round, fleshy andperfectly strong. Thy nipples are bulky, pointed, highlycaptivating like cold palm fruits, beautiful and ornamentedwith diverse jewels. O thou of beautiful smile! O thou ofbeautiful teeth! O thou of beautiful eyes! O fine damsel, thoudost carry away my heart like unto a river carrying awayits banks by its stream. The lock of thy hair is exquisitelyfine, thy breast very close and thy waist is so thin that theymay be got round even by fingers. There is none sobeautiful like thee—a Goddess, a Gandharbhi, a Yakshi or aKinnari. I had never seen before on this earth a damsel sobeautiful as thou. This thy beauty the best on earth, thyyouth, thy grace and thy abode in the forest do agitate mymind. So it is well for thee to come (with me); it doth notbehove thee to remain here. This is the abode of terribleRākshasas wearing shapes at will. Picturesque palaces,prosperous cities and sweet-smelling gardens are worthy ofthy abode. O thou of dark-blue eyes, fine is thy garland,fine is the smell of thy person and fine is thyapparel—methinks fine is thy husband too. O thou of pure smile!whom dost thou belong to?—Rudras, Marutas, or Vasus—Meseems, O fine damsel thou art a very gooddes. No onecomes here—the Gandharbas, the celestials or Kinnaras;this is an abode of the Rākshasas; how dost thou come here?Art thou not afraid of these monkeys, lions, tigers, wolves,bears, herons and hyenas? Alone in this forest, art thou notafraid of these terrible elephants of fierce motion andmaddened with the exuding of their temporal juice? Who artthou? Whose wife? What for dost thou range alone in thisforest of Dandaka frequented by terrible Rākshasas?\" Thusaddressed was Vaidehi by the vicious-souled Rāvana. Seeinghim come under the guise of a twice-born one, Maitheleeworshipped him with diverse articles necessary for serving aguest. Offering him a seat first and afterwards inviting himto wash his feet she said unto that one of placid look \"cookedrice is ready.\" Seeing Rāvana approach with Kamandaluand wearing a red cloth under the guise of a Brahmana,Maithelee could not pass by him any way, and consideringhim a twice-born one by various signs invited him as if aBrahmana saying, \"O Brahmana, do thou sit on this seat facingthe right; do thou take this water (to wash thy feet); do thouenjoy these well-cooked eatables growing in the forest andintended for thee.\" Jānaki the wife of Lord of men invitinghim thus, Rāvana, casting a look upon her, addressed himselffor his own destruction, to carry her away. She wasanxiously expecting the return of Rāma who had gone a-huntingwith Lakshmana; she looked around and behold but on allsides the spacious yellow forest-land—there was neitherRāma nor Lakshmana."

I am thedaughter of the high-souled Janaka, the king of Mithilā, thebeloved Queen of Rāma and my name is Sitā. Dwelling inthe palace of Ikshakus for twelve years, I enjoyed manythings passing human and had all my desires satisfied. On thethirteenth year king (Daçaratha) counselled with his ministersabout the installation of Rāma. Accordingly everythingnecessary for the installation being made ready, Kaikeyi, oneof my mothers-in-law, begged of her husband a boon.Bringing my father-in-law under control by means of her virtuousdeeds, Kaikeyi begged, of that truthful, best of monarchs,two boons namely the exile of my husband into the woods andthe installation of Bharata, and said \"I shall never eat,drink or sleep and (if Rāma be installed) I shall endmy life.\" Kaikeyi speaking thus, that lord of earth,my father-in-law begged her to accept diverse riches; butKaikeyi did not agree. Then the highly effulgent Rāma,my husband was twenty-five years old, and myself waseighteen years old counting from my birth. My husband isknown all over the world under the name of Rāma. He istruthful, good-natured, of pure character, ever engaged inthe welfare of all created beings, of mighty-arms andexpansive eyes. Our father the king Daçaratha was entirelyunder the control of passions, and hence for the satisfactionof Kaikeyi did not install Rāma. When Rāma came to hisfather for being installed Kaikeyi spoke unto my husband thefollowing cruel words, \"Do thou hear, O Rāghava, how Ihave been ordered by thy Sire. This kingdom, rid of thornsis to be conferred on Bharata, and thou shalt have to sojourninto woods for years nine and five. Do thou thereforerepair unto forest, O Kākuthstha and save thy Sire fromuntruth.\" Whereto Rāma fearlessly replied 'So be it!'Hearing her words my husband of firm vows acted accordingly. Healways maketh gifts and taketh none. He always speakethtruth and never telleth an untruth. This is his bestobservance, O Brahmana. His half-brother named Lakshmana isof mighty prowess. That best of men is Rāma's helpand the destroyer of foes in battle. That brother of hisnamed Lakshmana is of firm resolution and given toasceticism. With a bow in hand he hath followed (Rāma)flying as an exile unto woods along with me. Thus thatone (Rāma) of firm resolution and ever engaged in piousoffices wearing matted hair and assuming the semblance ofan ascetic hath entered this forest of Dandaka along withmyself and his younger brother. O thou the best oftwice-born ones, we three being deprived of our kingdom byKaikeyi have been living in this dense forest by virtue ofour effulgence. Do thou take heart for a moment and livehere. Instantly shall my husband return with good manywild fruits and roots and with sufficient meat after killingmany a deer, hog and Gosamp. Truly do thou relate untome thy name, Gotra and lineage. O thou twice-born one,why dost thou range alone in this forest of Dandaka?\" Sitāthe wife of Rāma speaking thus, the mighty Lord ofRākshasas—Rāvana replied with these harsh words—\"0Sitā I am that Rāvana, the lord of Rākshasas, whom fear thecelestials, Asuras and human beings.

That great city in the midstof the ocean, Lankā, encircled on all sides by the sea andsituated on the summit of a hill, is my capital. There shaltthou with me, Sitā, walk in gardens, and thus thou shallno more long for living in the forest. If thou dostbecome my wife, O Sitā, five thousand maid-servantsdecorated with divers ornaments shall serve thee.\" Thatblameless daughter of Janaka, being thus addressed byRāvana, was highly enraged, and, passing by him, replied, \"Iam a dependant ot Rāma, who is incapable of being shaken,like unto a mighty mountain, incapable of being agitated,like unto a vast ocean, and resembling Mahendra ineffulgence. I am a dependant of that great and truthful Rāmawho is gifted with auspicious marks and like unto a figtree. I am dependant of that lion among men, Rāma,of mighty arms, of a spacious breast and treading likea lion, I am a dependant of that son of a king, Rāma, ofmighty arms, having control over his passions, whose faceresembles the full moon and whose fame hath spread far andwide over the earth. Why dost thou being a tiger wish fora she-lion? Thou shalt not be able to touch me like untothe rays of the sun. O thou wretched Rākshasa, when thouhast desired to steal away Rāghava's beloved spouse, surelydost thou see these trees (before thee) as made of gold.Dost thou wish to uproot the teeth from the mouth of a lion,that enemy of deer, or from that of a serpent? Dost thouwish to clasp with thy hands the Mandara hill, or dost thouwish to walk in peace after drinking poison? Dost thou wishto rub thy eyes with pins and lick a razor with thy tongue?Thou dost wish to swim across an ocean, having a rocktied unto thy neck. Thou dost wish to get at the Sun andMoon, to bind a flaming fire with a piece of cloth and walkthrough iron-spikes, as thou hast wished to come by theworthy spouse of Rāma. Mighty is the difference betweenRāma and thee, like unto that between a lion and a jackal,a sea and a rivulet, nectar and gruel, gold and iron, sandaland mud, an elephant and a cat, a crow and Garuda, a peacockand a madgie (an acquatic bird), or a duck and a vulture. Evenif thou dost steal me, that mighty archer Rāma, gifted withthe prowess of the lord of celestials, living, surely shall I die,like unto a gnat sucking clarified butter.\" Addressing thosewords unto that wicked ranger of the night, that innocent(Sitā) shook like a plantain tree shaken by the wind.Thereupon Rāvana, like unto Death in prowess, trembling, beganto relate unto her with a view to frighten (her) his race,power, name and actions."

May good betidethee! Like unto people fearing Death, the celestials,Gandharbas, Piçāchas, Pannagas and Serpents fly indiverse directions being frightened by me. I have subduedby my prowess, my step-brother, the Lord of wealth in aconflict, quarrelling with him for some reason. Thereat, thatone carried by men, renouncing out of my fear this wealthyabode of Lānka, hath been living on that Lord of mountains,Kailaça. O thou auspicious one, by virtue of my prowess Ihave taken away that beautiful chariot of his called Puspaka.Ascending that chariot thou shalt travel by the etherialroute. O Maithilee, when I am excited with ire, Indraand other celestials at the mere sight of my countenance flyaway in divers directions out of fear. Wherever I live,the Wind bloweth cautiously and the Sun (of piercing rays)out of fear for me appeareth in the welkin like the Moon.What shall I say more? Wherever I live, even the leaves ofthe trees do not flutter and the currents of the rivers arestopped. Beyond the ocean stands my beautiful capitalLankā like unto Indra's Amarāvati, (the capital of the Lordof celestials), guarded on all sides by the terriblenight-rangers and encircled by yellow walls. That beautiful cityhath gate-ways of ornamented and jewelled arches andgolden apartments. It is filled with elephants, horses andchariots, always resounds with the sounds of bugles, and isbeautified with gardens having divers trees of wished forfruits. O Sitā, O thou the daughter of a king, in this cityshalt thou dwell with me. O large-minded damsel, thoushalt never think of earthly women. O thou of an exquisitecountenance, enjoying these many things passing human, thoushalt not any more think of Rāma—a human being of briefexistence. Placing his beloved son on the throne, kingDaçaratha hath sent away his eldest son of weak prowessinto the woods. O thou of expansive eyes, what shalt thou dowith that wretched ascetic Rāma who hath been deprived ofhis kingdom? I am the lord of the whole world of Rākshasas;being pierced by the shafts of Kama have I come by thee.It doth not behove thee therefore to pass by me. O timiddamsel, truly shalt thou repent afterwards if thou dostdisregard me, like unto Uruashee kicking Purarava. Rāmais a human being and is not even equal to a finger of minein battle. By thy good luck have I come unto thee—do thou give thyself up unto me, O thou of a beautifulcountenance.\" Being thus addressed by him, Vaidehiexceedingly wroth and with blood-red eyes spoke unto that Lord ofRākshasas in the lonely forest, these bold words. \"Howdost thou wish to perpetrate such an impious deed afterintroducing as thy brother that highly worshipful Kuveraadored by all the deities. O Rāvana, surely shall all theRākshasas meet with death, who have such a stupid, harshand lustful person like thee for their king. One can breatheon this earth carrying away Indra's wife, Sachi—but stealingme, the wife of Rāma, no body shall be able to live in peace.O Rākshasa, it might be possible for one to live on this earthtreating contemptuously the wife of the holder of thunder-bolt,but insulting me none shall escape the hands of Death evenif he drinketh nectar."

  "Āranya, Kishkindhā, and Sundara Kāndam": "Hearing those words of Sitā the highly powerfulTen-necked one striking his hands together, increased hisbody too high. Thereupon, that one skilled in speech againspake unto Maithilee, \"Methinks thou hast run mad. Hastthou not heard of my valour and prowess? Stationing myselfin the welkin I can with my hands raise up the earth. Ican drink up the waters of the ocean. And engaged in conflictI can destroy Death itself. With my sharpened shaftsI can pierce the Sun and cut asunder the earth. Thouart mad with thy beauty. Do thou look upon me, who amcapable of illusions.\" When he had spoken thus, his yelloweyes became blood-red with rage and assumed the semblanceof flaming fire. Thereat Rāvana, the younger brother ofthe Lord of wealth, changing his placid countenance, instantlyassumed his own terrible shape resembling that of Yama.Highly exercised with ire, that ranger of the night becameof ten countenances and twenty arms; his eyes werebloody and he appeared beautiful like unto blue clouds, beingdressed in gold-hued apparel. Leaving aside the semblanceof a mendicant, that lord of Rākshasas, Rāvana, increasingin bulk, assumed his own shape. And wearing a blood-redcloth he stood there fixing his look upon that jewel of adamsel—Maithili. Thereupon Rāvana spake unto Maithililike unto the rays of the sun, having a head of black hair andwearing apparel and ornaments, saying, \"O thou finedamsel, if thou dost wish to have a husband known all overthe world, do thou surrender thyself unto me. I am aworthy husband (or thee. Do thou serve me for ever, thypraiseworthy husband. O fine lady, I shall never do whatthou dost not like. Renouncing thy attachment for a man,do thou place thy love in me. O foolish girl, worthy ofbeing adored by the learned, for what quality art thouattached unto Rāma of a limited life, who hath been deprivedof his kingdom and hath his desire frustrated, and who ofan evil intent, hath, at the words of his wife, renouncing hiskingdom and kinsmen, been living in this forest—the abodeof voracious animals.\" Speaking thus unto Maithili,sweet-speeched and worthy of being sweetly addressed, thathighly wicked Rākshasa, Rāvana, being exercised withlust, approached towards Sitā and got hold of her, likeunto Budha holding Rohini in the sky. With his left handhe held her, having eyes like unto lotus-petals, bythe hair, and with his right hand got hold of her thighs.Seeing Rāvana of sharpened teeth, and mighty arms,resembling the summit of a mountain and like unto deathitself, the deties of the forest became highly terrified and fledin different directions. Instantly appeared there thecelestial car of Rāvana, decked in gold, drawn by asses andmaking a terrible sound. Thereupon, that one emmitingterrible accents, remonstrated with Vaidehi in harsh wordsand clasping her ascended the car. The virtuous Sitā, beingthus caught by Rāvana,began to cry aloud, addressing Rāma,who had gone away to a distant forest. Rāvana, rackedwith lust, rose high up with her like unto the wife of aPannaga, though she tried her best (to get rid of him), forshe was not in the least attached unto him. Being thuscarried away by the ethereal track by that Lord of Rākshasas,Sitā began to cry aloud, like one mad, distressed and ofderanged senses. \"Ah! mighty Lakshmana, ever ministeringunto the satisfaction of thy superiors, dost thou not knowthat I have been stolen away by a Rākshasa assumingshapes at will? O Rāghava, for virtue hast thou renouncedthy life, happiness and wealth,—dost thou not see that I havebeen carried away by one of mighty iniquity? O thou thesubduer of foes,thou dost always control the rebellious,—whydost thou not punish such a vicious Rākshasa? The viciousdo not instantaneously meet with the fruits of their actions;as for corn to ripen requires the assistance of time. For thisiniquitous deed, which thou hast perpetrated, availing of thetime and losing thy sense, thou shalt meet with a mightydisaster from Rāma, bringing about thy end. Ah! being thevirtuous wife of the virtuous and far-famed Rāma, I havebeen stolen away. Now hath the desire of Kaikeyi and otherrelations been fulfilled. I invoke this Janasthāna and theseflowery Karnikās to tell Rāma that Rāvana hath stolen awaySitā. I invoke thee, O Godavari, having swans and cranessporting in thy stream, to tell Rāma that Rāvana hath stolenaway Sitā. I salute and invoke the deities that live in thisforest of many trees to tell my husband of my being stolenaway (by Rāvana). I do seek the refuge of all deer, birdsand other animals that live in this forest, and may they allcommunicate unto Rāma the news of his dear spousebeing carried away, and tell him that Sitā, losing her control,hath been stolen away by Rāvana. Even if I am taken awayby Yama, and if the mighty-armed Rāma is apprised of it,surely shall he bring me back by the display of his prowess.\"Racked with sorrow that one of expansive eyes, while thusbewailing in piteous accents, she espied Yatāyu, the king ofvultures, seated on a tree. Thereat the daughter of Janaka,brought under the control of Rāvana and terrified, began tocry and utter those piteous words—\"O worshipful Yatāyu, dothou see that this vicious lord of Rākshasas hath ruthlesslycarried me away like one having no husband. Thou wiltnot be able to withstand this mighty, wicked and cruelnight-ranger wearing emblems of conquest and having ascimitar in his hand. Do thou relate unto Rāma and toLakshmana everything about my being carried away from thebeginning to the end."

It doth not behove thee to perpetrate such aniniquitous deed before me. I am Yātayu, the mighty lord of vultures.Daçaratha's son Rāma is the lord of all men like untoMahendra and Varuna. He is ever engaged in the welfareof all men. This exquisitely beautiful and far-famed Sitāwhom thou art about to steal away, is the married wife ofthat lord of men. And how dost thou thyself being amonarch and engaged in the royal office of maintainingsubjects, carry away by stealth another's wife? O thou ofmighty prowess, thou shouldst specially protect the wives ofkings. Do thou therefore control thy base inclination ofoppressing another's wife. A hero doth never perform whatbringeth calumny upon himself. It becometh every individualto save another's wife from the touch of a second man likeunto his own wife. O son of Paulastya, at the instance ofthe king mild subjects perform many an action conducingto virtue, wealth and desire, though not mentioned in theSastras. The king is the virtue, the king is the desire andthe king is the prime jewel of all subjects. Virtue, desireor sin—every thing ariseth from the king. O thou the best ofRākshasas, thou art vicious and unsteady; how hast thoucome by rkhes like unto a sinner attaining to the abode ofcelestials? A vicious person can never relinquish hissinful habits—virtue doth never reside in the abodes of impiouspersons."

Like unto Indra burningdown Vitrasura, Rāma, looking with his terrible eyes likeflaming fire, shall reduce thee to ashes.

Whoengageth himself in such an action as doth not confer virtue,fame or glory, but bringeth about physical affliction only?O Rāvana, I am sixty thousand years old and have beenadministering regularly my ancestral kingdom. Old though Iam, thou shalt not be able to carry away with safety Jānaki inmy presence, young, accoutered in mails as thou art withbow and arrows in thy hands and ascending a car. As it isnot easy to destroy, by the reasonings of Logic, Vedas andSruties containing eternal and immutable truths, so thou shaltnot be able to carry away Vaidehi by force before me. If thouart a hero do thou fight. Or do thou wait for a moment,O Rāvana, thou shalt also embrace the earth like untoKhara. Soon shall Rāma clad in bark destroy thee in thebattle field, who hadst many a time and oft destroyed inconflict the celestials and Dānavas. These two princesRāma and Lakshmana are at a distance, what shall I donow? O vile being, undoubtedly shalt thou, terrified, bedestroyed by them.

There occured a mighty conflictbetween Yatāyu, the lord of vultures, and Rāvana, the lord ofRākshasas, like unto two Malyavān57 hills supplied withwings. Thereat Rāvana began to shower continuallyterrible and sharpened pikes, iron arrows and Vikarnisupon the mighty lord of vultures. Yatāyu, the king of birds,began to withstand in conflict the arrows and weaponsdarted by Rāvana, and wounded Rāvana's person with hisfeet supplied with sharpened talons. Thereupon, to destroyhis enemy, that mighty hero, the Ten-necked Rāvana, beingexercised with ire, took up ten terrible arrows like untothe sceptre of Death, and stretching the bow to the full heshot those straight-coursing sharpened shafts at Yatāyu,the king of birds. Beholding Jānaki with tears In her eyesin that Rākshasa's car, Yatāyu, the king of birds, disregardingthose arrows, darted towards Rāvana, and with his feetbroke asunder his bow with the arrows, adorned with pearlsand diamonds. Thereat Rāvana, almost beside himself withwrath, taking up another bow, began to shower arrows byhundreds and thousands. Being covered with those arrows,the lord of birds appeared like a bird lying in his nest.Pushing away these arrows by the wind of his wings, heagain snapped that mighty bow with his feet, and witha stroke of his wings shattered Rāvana's flaming shield likeunto burning fire. Thereupon, moving away with the windof his wings Rāvana's blazing cuirass resembling flamingfire, Jatāyu in that conflict made away with his fleet-coursingasses having the faces of demons. Next crumblinginto pieces with his impetus the mighty chariot of Rāvana,coursing at will, flaming like fire, having steps studdedwith jewels, and a wooden pole, and throwing down theumbrella and chowris like unto the full moon along with theRākshasas engaged in carrying them,the effulgent and mightylord of birds shattered the head of the charioteer withthe strokes of his beak. Having his bow snapped anddeprived of his car, horses and charioteer, Rāvana fell downto the earth, taking Vaidehi on his lap.

He had all hisweapons broken in the conflict, and had but his dagger leftto him. Beholding him proceed thus pleased, taking thedaughter of Janaka on his lap,—all his weapons having beenlost, with his sword alone left,—the mighty and powerful lordof vultures, Yatāyu, rose up and, darting towards Rāvana,resisted him and said,—\"O Rāvana of feeble sense, it is forthe destruction of the whole line of Rākshasas that thoucarriest away this spouse of Rāma, having arrows likeunto thunderbolts. Like one thirsty drinking water, thoudost address thyself to drinking poison along with thy friends,courtiers, four-fold forces, servants and relatives. Foolishpersons unaware of the fruit of their actions, meet in a shorttime with their own destruction,—so shalt thou very soonmeet with thy own end. Thou hast been bound up by thenoose of Death; and, proceeding whither, shalt thou savethyself, like unto fish eating up baits with hooks for theirown destruction? O Rāvana, it is beyond thy power todefeat the Kākutsthas. They shall not forgive thee for thisthy encroachment upon their asylum.

Do thou fight, ORāvana, if thou art a hero, or wait for a moment and thoushalt lie down on the earth like unto thy brother Khara.Truly hast thou for thy own destruction engaged thyself inthese impious acts, which are perpetrated by men on the eveof their death. What person doth that which leadeth solelyinto sin? Neither the lord of celestials nor the self-createDeity doth engage in such an action.\" Addressing thesemoral words, the mighty Yatāyu swooped on the back of thatTen-necked Rākshasa. Like unto the rider of a madelephant, the lord of vultures began to tear Rāvana with hissharpened claws, and that one having for his weapons hisbeak, talons, and wings, began to rive Rāvana's backwith his beak and claws, and to uproot his hair. Beingthus aflicted again and again by the king of vultures, theRākshasa shook, with his lips quivering in anger. Besidehimself with anger, Rāvana, holding Jānaki fast by her left flank,struck Yatāyu with his palms. Yatāyu, the subduer of foes,bearing the strokes, tore into pieces his ten left arms withhis beak. His arms cut off, instantly sprang up as many others,like unto serpents issuing out of ant-hills, being exercised withthe pangs of poison. The mighty Ten-necked one, leavingaside Sitā, out of anger bore down Yatāyu with his fists andfeet. Thereupon arose a mighty conflict between the lord ofof vultures and the lord of Rākshasas of incomparableprowess. Yatāyu addressing himself to displaying his prowessfor the benefit of Rāma, Rāvana taking out his dagger, cutoff his two wings, two legs and two sides. The ranger ofthe night of cruel deeds having sundered his wings, the kingof vultures approaching wellnigh the verge of death, felldown on the earth. Beholding him fallen on the grandwith his person bathed in blood, Sitā. became exceedinglyaggrieved and darted towards him like unto a friend. Thelord of Lankā beheld Yatāyu, fallen on the ground, resemblingsable clouds, having a yellow breast and of exceedingprowess,—like unto an extinguished forest-fire. Then Sitāthe daughter of Janaka, having a moon-like countenancebegan lamenting, clasping with her hands Yatāyu, crushedand fallen on the ground by the vehemence of Rāvana'sprowess."

And, O Rāma, although birds and beasts arescampering away before thee on my account, thouunderstandest not the mighty mishap that has befallen thee. ORāma, this bird, who, moved by kindness, had come to rescueme, owing to my (ill) luck, lies slain on the ground. OKākutstha, O Lakshmana, save me!\" Thus did that best offemales, afflicted with fear, bewail; and those near (her)heard her lamentations. Thereat, that lord of the Rākshasas,Rāvana, darted towards Vadehi, who, with a faded wreathfor her ornament, was bewailing in forlorn guise.Exclaiming repeatedly, \"Leave off!\" \"Leave off,\" the lord of theRākshasas got at her, as she was clasping a mighty tree asif it were a creeper. And as she, bereft of the company ofRāma in the wilderness, was wailing, saying, \"O Rāma,\"\"O Rāma,\" that one resembling the Destroyer himself, withthe view of compassing his own end, seized her by her hair.On Vaidehi being thus outraged, this entire world consistingof mobile and immobile objects, had its nature altered. Adense darkness enveloped (everything). And the air did notbreathe there; and the sun grew dim. Espying with hisdivine vision that Sitā was overcome, that Deity, the gracefulGreat-father exclaimed, \"Our work is accomplished.\" Andseeing Sitā overpowered, the supreme saints inhabitingthe Dandaka forest, concluding the destruction of Rāvanato be as good as accomplished without much ado, becameat once delighted and aggrieved. As she went on weepingwith \"O Rāma,\" \"O Lakshmana,\" Rāvana—lord of Rākshasas—taking her, coursed through the sky. And then the king'sdaughter hued like molten gold, clad in a yellow silkencloth, looked exceedingly beautiful like unto lightning. Andon her yellow cloth streaming up, Rāvana looked surpassinglygraceful like a hill aflame with fire. And coppery fragrantlotus-leaves belonging to the eminently auspicious Vaidehishowered upon Rāvana. And her gold-glowing silken cloth,flying in the air, appeared like clouds colored by the sunkensun. And her blameless countenance on Rāvana's lap inthe sky did not appear beauteous without Rāma,—like a lotuswithout its stalk; it appeared like the moon risen tearingaway dark clouds. And in the aerial regions hercountenance on Rāvana's lap furnished with a fair forehead andgraceful hair glowing like the interior of a lotus, withoutscars, graced with white, shining, stainless teeth, havingexcellent eyes,—lovely like the moon, having a shapely nose,a rubeous upper lip,—wearing the splendour of gold in thesky,—that captivating countenance of hers in consequence ofher weeping, and of being stained with tears, as also owingto the violence it had undergone at the hands of the lordof Rākshasas—did not appear beautiful without Rāma; likethe moon risen during the day. And furnished with the hueof gold, Mithilā's daughter beside the dark-bodied lord ofthe Rākshasas, looked like a golden girth round a sableelephant. And Janaka's daughter, yellow-hued like lotus,having the lustre of gold.—and adorned with shiningornaments, coming in contact with Rāvana, appeared likelightning embosomed among clouds. And in consequenceof Vaidehi's ornaments sending sounds, the lord of Rākshasasresembled an entirely dark rumbling cloud. And as Sitāwas being borne away, showers of blossoms, falling off fromher head, were scattered all around on the earth beneath.And that blossomy shower all around, drawn up by thevehemence of the ten-headed Rāvana, again alighted besidehim. And the showers of blossoms scattered aroundVaiçravana's younger brother, looked like rows of burningstars round the foremost of mountains.58 And the banglesstudded with gems, loosened from Vaidehi's feet, fell on theearth, like the lightning circle.59 Of hue like the light red oftender twigs, Vaidehi set off the dark-bodied lord ofRākshasas, as does a golden cover an elephant. Vaiçravana'syounger brother carried away Sitā, who, like a mightymeteor, filled the heavens with her splendour. And likestars of exhausted religious merit dropping down from thesky, her fiery ornaments began to fall to the earth withsounds. And the chain of the splendour of the moon, removedfrom Vaidehi's breast, falling down, shone like the Gangādropping from the sky. The trees filled with various fowls,with their tops waving because of the wind blowing on highand swaying them, seemed to say, \"No fear,\" [unto Sitā.]And the pools with their lotuses faded and their fishesagitated, seemed to sorrow for the desponding daughter ofMithilā as for their friend. And following Sitā's shadow,lions, and tigers, and other beasts and birds, rushed from allsides in wrath. And the mountains, with their faces washedwith water-falls representing tears, and their summitsresembling uplifted arms, seemed to lament for Sitā, as she wasbeing carried away. And beholding Vaidehi carried away,the glorious Sun, oppressed with sadness, had his raysdimmed and his disc darkened. \"Virtue is not; and whereis truth? And there is neither sincerity nor kindness,—in acase in which Rāvana is carrying away Rāma's Vaidehithus did all creatures lament in numbers. And the young ofdeer, afflicted with fear, wept with woe-begone faces. Andthe sylvan deities, looking up now and again with eyesbetokening fear, had their persons all in a tremble. Forcompassing his own destruction, the Ten-headed one carriedaway the intelligent Vaidehi, bewailing bitterly, Sitā, whohad come by such misfortune, sweet-voiced, crying, \"OLakshmana\" \"O Rāma,\" and casting glances on the groundmany a time and oft,—the ends of her hair waving and hertilika wiped out. Then oppressed with the load of fear, Sitāof luminous smiles,—Mithilā' s daughter, bereft of her friends—not beholding either Rāma or Lakshmana, became pale ofcountenance."

Her eyes expressingrage, weeping and fright, Sitā, as she was being carried away,weeping piteously, spoke to the grim-eyed lord of theRākshasas, saying, \"Dost thou not, O base wretch,Rāvana, feel shame on account of this act—thou, who,knowing that I was alone, fliest away, carrying me? Cowardthat thou art, thou it was, who, desirous of carrying me off,by the shape of a deer, hadst, by thy [powers of] illusiontaken away my lord. And he also that endeavoured torescue me, has been slain by thee—the ancient king ofvultures, who was the friend of my father-in-law. Great,forsooth, is found to be thy might, thou vilest of Rākshasas;in that thou hast carried me off by simply declaring thy name,but hast not won me in war. Why dost thou not, O execrableone, take shame unto thyself, having perpetrated such aheinous act—having carried off another's wife in the absenceof her husband? This fell and foul act of thine fraught withunrighteousness, heroic persons shall bruit about the world.Fie on thy heroism and thy truth,—of which thou didst apeakat that time; and fie also on this character of thine,calculated to sully thy line in this world. What can I do (untothee), as thou proceedest with speed? But stay thou for amoment; and thou shalt not return with life. Shouldstthou come within the range of the vision of those sons ofthe king, thou couldst not, although thou shouldst happento be accompanied with thy army, live for a moment. Evenas a bird cannot bear the touch of a flaming fire in a forest,thou canst never bear the touch of their arrows. Effectingthy own welfare, do thou, O Rāvana, leave me. If thou donot let me go, my husband along with his brother wouldstrive for thy destruction. As intent upon sensul enjoyment,thou endeavourest to ravish me, this very endeavour ofthine, O mean wight, shall come to naught. Not beholdingmy lord resembling a celestial, I cannot, come under thesway of my enemy, bear to live long. As one dwelling onearth perceives objects in their reversed relations at thetime of one's death, so thou dost not perceive what is for thygood or profit. Those moribund do not relish what woulddo them good. I see thee with the noose of Death woundround thy neck. As, O ranger of night, thou art notaffected with fear, albeit the situation is one calculated to raiseone's apprehensions, it is clear that thou wilt see the goldentrees, the dreadful river Vaitarani flowing with blood, theterrible wood, O Rāvana, rife with leaves in the shape ofswords, and a sharp Sālmali containing blossoms of shininggold, having lapises for its leaves, and bearing iron thorns.But, O shameless one, like a person that hath drunk poison,having done this wrong unto that high-souled one, thouwilt not be able to save thyself. O Rāvana, thou art fastfettered in the noose of Death. Having done this foul turnunto that high-souled one, repairing whither, shalt thou obtainrespite? Shall not that strong and heroic Rāghava, skilledin all weapons, who without his brother, in the twinklingof an eye, in battle slew fourteen thousand Rākshasas, slaythee, who carriest away his beloved wife?\" Thus and inother ways, Videha's daughter, lying on the lap of Rāvana,overwhelmed with fear and grief, indulged in piteouslamentations. And the wicked (Rāvana) with a shaking framecarried away the daughter of the king extremely distressed,speaking much, and speaking piteously, utteringlamentations, and putting forth endeavours (to free herself.)"

  "Āranya, Kishkindhā, and Sundara Kāndam": "Carried away (by Rāvana), Vaidehi, not finding anydefender, saw five principal monkeys stationed on the topof a hill. Thereat, that lady of expansive eyes andsurpassing charms, in the hope that they might convey theintelligence unto Rāma, flung off in their midst her gold-gleamingsilken sheet, and elegant ornaments. But the Ten headedone owing to hurry did not observe the throwing of thecloth along with the ornaments. Those foremost of monkeyshaving tawny eyes observed with winkless eyes thelarge-eyed Sitā as she was giving way to grief. And the lord ofRākshasas, passing beyond Pampā, directed his coursetowards the city of Lankā, taking Mithilā's daughter alongwith him, indulging in lamentations. Experiencing theheight of delight, Rāvana ravished her, taking her on his lap,like a sharp-toothed serpent of virulent poison. And speedily,like an arrow shot from a bow, he, coursing the welkin,left behind woods and streams and mountains andpieces of water. And coming to the abode of Varuna, thatrefuge of rivers, the exhaustless ocean—the home ofwhales and alligators, he crossed over it. Inconsequence of the carrying away of Vaidehi, Varuna's abode,from grief, had all its waves stilled and its fishes andmighty snakes inert.—And the Chāranas uttered in theheavens these words, \"O Ten-headed one, this is thyend.\" Thus did the Siddhas then say. And taking Sition his lap, representing his own Death,—who endeavoured(to liberate herself), Rāvana entered the city of Lankā. Andentering the city of Lankā, vast, with all its highwayswell-arranged, and with people thronging its gates, heentered his own inner apartment. Then Rāvana set Sitāthere, having eyes with dark outer corners, exercised withgrief and dole; as if Maya had set his own Asura Illusion(in his own palace). Then the Ten-headed one spoke untosome female friends of terrible visages, \"Let no man orwoman behold Sitā without my permission. And I commandthat, should she ask for pearls, or rubies, or gold, or apparel,or ornaments, the same should be rendered unto her. Shethat, whether knowingly or unknowingly should say anythingunpleasant to Vaidehi, would hold her life cheap.\" Havingsaid this unto the Rākshasis, the puissant lord of theRāksahsas, went out of the inner apartment, and thought withinhimself as to what was to be done (next). And he saweight flesh-eating Rākshasas of wondrous prowess. Andseeing them, the exceedingly powerful (Rāvana), blindedby the bestowal of the boon, after extolling their strengthand heroism, addressed them, saying, \"Equipped withvarious weapons, do ye speedily take yourself to Janasthāna,—that field of carnage—which ere this contained the abodeof Khara; and casting off fear at a distance, do yesojourn in vacant Janasthāna with all its Rākshasas slain(by Rāma). A great many troops endeued with exceedingprowess, who had been posted in Janasthāna, have, alongwith Dushana and Khara, been slain by the shafts of Rāma.Hence unprecedented is my wrath, towering above mypatience; and great and fierce also is the hostility I haveconceived against Rāma. I wish to avenge myself on mymighty enemy. Sleep find I none without slaying my foein fight. Slaying that slayer of Khara and Dushana, Rāma, Ishall attain delight like unto that attained by a pauper ongaining riches. Staying in Janasthāna, ye shall gather trueinformation touching Rāma as to what he is about. Repairall ye rangers of the night carefully, and strive yourselvesalways for slaying Rāma. I have been well acquainted withyour strength in many a field, and it is for this that I setye in Janasthāna.\" Hearing these agreeable and weightywords of Rāvana, those Rākshasas, bowing down untoRāvana, left Lankā, and in a body invisibly proceeded inthe direction of Janasthāna. Having obtained Mithilā'sdaughter, Rāvana experienced great joy in establishing her(in his own house); and having created high hostility withRāma, Rāvana through blindness rejoiced greatly."

  "Āranya, Kishkindhā, and Sundara Kāndam": "Having commissioned those eight terrible and mightyRākshasas, Rāvana, in consequence of perversion of sense,considered himself as crowned with success. And broodingover Vaidehi, he, sore pierced by the shafts of Kāma, hastilyentered his charming mansion, with the intention of seeingSitā. And entering that apartment, Rāvana—lord ofRākshasas—saw the distressed Sitā in the midst of theRākshasas, with a tearful countenance, oppressed with a loadof grief, like unto a bark sinking in the ocean throughthe violence of the winds; like unto a doe separatedfrom the herd of deer, and surrounded by dogs. Coming toSitā disconsolate in consequence of stress of sorrow,remaining with her head bent down, that ranger of the night, thelord of the Rākshasas, forcibly shewed unto her thatmansion resembling the mansion of the celestials, thick withpalaces and lordly piles, inhabited by thousands of females;containing birds of vaious kinds; furnished with variousgems; with beautiful pillars of ivory gold and crystaland silver, studded with diamonds and lapises. Rāvana incompany with Sitā ascended the beautiful golden stairs,resounding with the sounds of kettle-drums and embellishedwith ornaments of burnished gold. And those loftly edificeshad excellent windows made of ivory and silver, and coveredwith golden nets. The ground all over was decorated withambrosia and gems. The Ten-headed one in his own mansionshewed unto Maithilee large tanks and pools covered withvarious kinds of flowers. (All this) Rāvana shewed untoSitā overmastered by sorrow. And after having shewedunto Vaidehi the whole of that goodliest of mansions, thatwicked one, with the intention of tempting Sitā, spoke untoher, saying, \"O Sitā, leaving out old men and boys, I amthe lord of thirty two kotis of night-rangers of terrible deeds.And a thousand come forward whenever required for anyservice.—If such is my sovereignty, all this is establishedin thee, O large-eyed lady, as well as my life. Thou artdearer unto me than life. O Sitā, be thou the mistressof those numerous excellent women who are my wives. Dear,be thou my wife. This is for thy good. Why shoudst thouact otherwise? Do thou relish my speech. Do thou bend thymind towards me. It behoves thee to favor me, who amburning (in the heat of desire). This Lankā measuring anhundred Yoyanas girt round by the ocean, is incapable ofbeing harassed by the celestials themselves headed by Indra.Neither among the celestials nor Yakshas nor Gandharbasnor Serpents, find I any one that can match me in prowess.What wilt thou do with Rāma a human being of short life,poor, of small prowess, practising mendicancy? O Sitā,bend thy mind unto me. I am a fit husband for thee. Otimed one, youth is uncertain. Sport with me here. And,O thou of a handsome countenance, do not wish for thesight of Rāghava. O Sitā, what power hath he to comehither even in thought? None can fetter the exceedinglyfleet wind in the sky, or hold the bright flame of a burningfire. O beauteous one, in these three worlds I find no onethat can by his might carry thee away, who art protectedby my arms. Do thou govern at Lankā this extensivekingdom. The like of me and celestials and all that aremobile and immobile shall be thy servants. Laving thylimbs with water, do thou gratify me. The evil that thouhadst done, hath been expiated by thy life in the forest: nowdo thou reap the fruit of thy good deeds. Here are garlandsfurnished with divine fragrance, and, O Maithili, superbornaments. Enjoy thou all those along with me. O thouof shapely hips, the car called Pushpaka, resembling the sun,which (formerly) belonged to my brother Vaiçravana, wasthrough my prowess won by me in fight. And vast andbeautiful is that car furnished with the speed of the mind.Do thou, O Sitā, at thy pleasure sport on it along with me.Thy face stainless and lovely to look at, resembling the lotus,doth not, O thou of a comely countenance, O magnificentdamsel, appear beautiful in consequence of thy beingexercised with grief. When Rāvana had spoken thus, thatbest of females Sitā muffling up her moon-like countenancewith the ends of her cloth, began to shed gentle tears.Thereat the heroic ranger of the night, Rāvana, said untoSitā, distressed, sunk in thought, and deprived of hersplendour through anxiety, \"O Vaidehi, banish bashfulness, whichstands in the way of one's duty. The yearning I feel afterthee is in consonance with what the sages prescribe. Thesetender feet of thine I press upon my heads. Do thou speedilyshew thy favor unto me. I am thy slave (ever) obedientunto thee. Let not these words of mine spoken by me underthe withering influence of love prove fruitless. Rāvana hathnever bowed his head to any female.\" Having said this,the Ten-headed one, come under the subjection of theDestroyer, looked upon Maithili, Janaka's daughter (as hisown) saying, \"She is mine.\""

  "Āranya, Kishkindhā, and Sundara Kāndam": "Having been thus addressed, Vaidehi unaffected byfear, although exercised with grief, placing a blade of grassbetween herself and Rāvana, answered him, saying, \"Therewas a king named Daçaratha, the bridge of righteousness,like unto a mountain, ever bearing regard towards the truth,and renowned among men, whose son is Rāghava. He isnamed Rāma, and is righteous-souled and celebrated over thethree worlds. He is long-armed, of expansive eyes,—likeunto a celestial—he is my husband. Born in the race of theIkshwākus, he hath the shoulders of a lion and is possessedof exceeding effulgence—the same that along with hisbrother, Lakshmana, shall take thy life. If thou hadstwronged me forcibly in his presence, thou wouldst have lainin battle in Janasthāna even as Khara.\" All the mightyRākshasas of grim visages, whom thou hast extolled (beforeme) shall be deprived of their venom before Rāma, asserpents are before Suparna. The shafts decorated withgold shot by the bow-string of Rāghava, shall pierce theirbodies, as the waves of the Ganga (beat against) her banks,Although, O Rāvana, thou mayst be incapable of beingslain either by the gods or the Asuras, yet having roused thehigh hostility of Rāghava, thou wilt not be able to liberatethy life. The strong Rāghava will compass the end of whatremains of thy life. Like the life of a beast tied to thesacrificial stake, thy own is incapable of being reclaimed,Should Rāma look at thee with eyes aglow with anger, thou,O Rākshasa, wouldst be consumed even as Manmatha was byRudra. He who is able to bring down the Moon or destroyhim, and to drink up the ocean dry, will surely liberate Sitāfrom here. Thy days are numbered, and auspiciousnesshath bidden thee adieu. Thou art shorn of strength, and thysenses have been dulled. And it is owing to thee thatLankā shall be subject to widowhood. That thou by forcehast for naught carried me away from the side of my husband—this sinful act can never conduce to thy felicity. Thatexceedingly effulgent lord of mine along with my husband'syounger brother, summoning up their energy, is fearlesslydwelling in the vacant Dandaka. By means of an arrowyshower in conflict, he will take thy prowess and strength,thy hauteur and wickedness out of thy person. When urgedby the Destroyer, the destruction of creatures is perceptible,then, coming under the sway of the Destroyer, men becomecareless in their actions. Having outraged me, thou, Oworst of Rākshasas, thy time come; for compassing thy owndestruction as well as that of the Rākshasas and thosedwelling in thy inner apartment. A Chandāla cannot tread thedais reared in the midst of a sacrifice beauteous with ladles,and vessels, and sanctified by the twice-born ones. So I,the religiously wedded wife of that one, ever intent on virtue,and (always) firm in my vows, is incapable, thou vilest ofRākshasas, of being touched by thee, a sinner. How canthe female that hath always sported with her mate amidstlotuses, cast her eyes on a shag staying among rushes. Dothou either bind or destroy this body deprived of sensation.This body will I not protect, nor yet this life, O Rāvana;and I shall not be able to bring blame on myself in thisworld.\" Having said these harsh words in wrath, Videha'sdaughter, Jānaki, did not there again say anything untoRāvana. Hearing Sitā's words, harsh and calculated tomake one's down stand on end, Rāvana answered her inwords tending to excite one's apprehension, \"Hear, OMaithili, my words. O damsel if, O thou of sweet smiles,within this time thou do not turn thyself unto me, the cooksshall cut thee off in pieces to serve my morning meal.\"Having herself spoken thus, Rāvana,—challenger of foes—growing exceedingly wroth, addressed the Rākshasis inthese words, \"Ye frightful Rākshasis terrible to behold,subsisting on flesh and gore, do ye at once crush her pride.\"As soon as he had said this, those frightfnl and terribleRākshasis with joined hands encircled Maithili. Then thegrim-visaged king Rāvana, as if riving the earth by histread, proceeding a pace or two, said, \"Do ye take Maithilito the wood of Asokas. There surrounding her, do yesecretly guard her; and there (sometimes) by storming, and(at others) by means of soft speech, do ye all strive to bringMithilā's daughter, like a wild female elephant, under yoursway.\" Thus commanded by Rāvana, those Rākshasistaking Maithili along with them, went to the Asoka wood,abounding with trees granting every desire, and filled withvarious kinds of fruits and flowers; and frequented by fowlsfraught with juices at all seasons. And as a doe comesunder the subjection of tigresses, Janaka's daughter, Maithili,her frame worked up with grief, came under the sway of theRākshasis. And like a female deer fast bound by a trap,Janaka's timid daughter Maithili, agitated by the mightygrief, did not attain respite. And greatly up-braided bythe fierce eyes (of the Rākshasis), Maithili did not knowrepose; and, afflicted with grief and fear, she, rememberingher beloved lord along with Lakshmana swooned away."

On Sitā havingentered Lankā, the great father addressed the gratifiedDevendra of an hundred sacrifices, \"For bringing about theweal of the three worlds, and the woe of the Rākshasas,Sitā hath been taken into Lankā by the wicked-minded,Rāvana. Devoted unto her husband, the exalted lady alwaysbrought up in happiness, not seeing her husband, andseeing (on the other hand) environed by numbers ofRākshasis,—is hungering after the sight of her lord.The city of Lankā is situated on the shores of the lord ofrivers and streams. How can Rāma get a knowledge ofthat blameless one, staying there? Brooding over thevarious ills she hath undergone, that exceedingly rare damselis passing her days. Surely she will resign her existence.Great is the doubt that hath arisen as to Sitā putting aperiod to her existence. Having thyself from here, do thousee the fair-faced Sitā. Having entered the city of Lankā,offer excellent clarified butter.\" Thus addressed by thereverend chastiser of Paka, Devendra in company withsleep, approached the city ruled by Rāvana. He thenaddressed sleep, saying, \"Go thou; and stupify theRākshasas.\" Thus accosted by Maghavat, that goddess,exceedingly delighted, for securing success to the work ofthe celestials, covered the Rākshasas with stupor. In themeanwhile, that god, the thousand-eyed lord of Sachi wentto (Sitā) staying in the woods, and spoke unto her thesewords, \"I am the sovereign of the celestials. Good betidethee! I am here, O thou of luminous smiles! For securingsuccess unto the work of the magnanimous Rāghava, I willlend my aid unto thee. Do not, O daughter of Janaka,grieve. Through my grace, he shall along with his forcescross over the ocean. And, O excellent wench, I have bymy supernal power, stupified the Rākshasis. And, O Sitā,for this reason, I along with sleep, taking these rice,—riceboiled in clarified butter, have, O Vaidehi, come unto thee.If thou partake of these from my hand, thou shalt neverbeuteous one, be afflicted either with hunger or thirst,thou of thighs resembling rambhā (trunks), for years.\"Thus addressed, Sitā, alarmed, said, \"How can I know theefor Devendra, Sachi's husband, staying here? By the sideof Rāma and Lakshmana, I had beheld the signs of thecelestials. If, O Devendra, thou art thyself the sovereignof the celestials, show those unto me.\" Hearing Sitā'swords, the lord of Sachi did accordingly. He did not touchthe earth with his feet, and his eyes remained winkless. Hebloomed in youth, and the blossoms did not fade on hisattire. Thereupon knowing him for Vasava, Sitā wasoverjoyed. And weeping, she spoke regarding Rāghava, \"Byluck it is that I had heard of that mighty-armed one alongwith his brother. As is my father-in-law, the king, as isthe master of Mithilā, so art thou (unto me), thou whom Ibehold to-day; my husband hath now found a protector.—And by thy command, O Devendra, will I partake ofthis pāyasa cooked with milk, which hath been offeredunto me, and which shall enhance (the prosperity) of ourrace.\" Thereupon taking the pāyasa from Indra's hands,that Maithili of luminous smiles (mentally) offered it untoher husband as well as Lakshmana. \"If my mighty lord livealong with his brother, let this through my reverencefor them, be theirs.\" She then partook of the pāyasaherself. Having thus eaten it, that one of excellentcountenance, had her hunger and rising sorrow removed;and attaining a mental tendency from Indra, Jānaki grewglad with reference to the Kākutshthas. And Sakra also forbringing about the success of Rāghava's work, with a pleasedmind, went to the abode of celestials. And greeting Sitāagain and again, that high-souled celestial, in company withsleep went back to his own abode.\""

And as he hurried himself, eager to behold Maithili,jackals began to howl hideously at his back. Hearing theirharsh cries, capable of making one's hair stand on end,Rāma struck with fear at the voices of the jackals, becamefilled with alarm. \"Ah! I consider this as inauspicious—that these jackals are crying. Escaping being devoured by theRākshasas, may fair fortune befall Vaidehi!If Lakshmana should have heard the cries which Māricha, knowingmy voice, and fixing on the means of harming me, utteredin the form of a deer, Saumitri, hearing that voice, leavingMithilā's daughter and commissioned by herself, must havecome near me. Surely, the Rākshasas in a body are desirousof slaying Sitā. Becoming a golden deer, Māricha, havingallured me far, transformed himself into a Rākshasa, as soonas he had been struck with my shafts; and exclaimed, 'Ah!Lakshmana, slain am I.' It is doubtless, we having left(Sitā), whether all is well with her. I having raised thehostility of the Rākshasas for the sake of Janasthāna; andmany and dreadful are the omens I see (around me).\"Thus reflecting as he heard the bowlings of the jackals, theself-possessed Rāma with hasty steps returned to theasylum. Rāghava went back to Janasthāna, alarmed inconsequence of his having been drawn away by theRākshasa in the form of a deer. And birds and beastsapproached that high-souled one distressed and depressedin spirit; and staying on his left set up frightful cries. Ashe was witnessing the exceedingly dreadful signs, Rāghavasaw Lakshmana coming with a lacklustre (countenance);and Lakshmana came up to Rāma. And depressed in spirit,he was rendered still more sad by that one who, afflictedwith depression shared his sorrow. And, seeing that(Lakshmana) had come, leaving Sitā in that solitary woodfrequented by Rākshasas, his brother fell to reprimandinghim. And taking Lakshmana's left; hand, the son of Raghuin extreme distress sweetly spake these rough words, \"Alas!Lakshmana, thou hast committed a censurable act;leaving Sitā, O mild one, thou hast come hither. Is it wellwith her? I make no doubt, O hero, but that Janaka'sdaughter hath either been slain or devoured by Rākshasasranging the forest. And, considering the many omens thattake place before me, O Lakshmana, I do not know whetherwe shall light upon welfare of Janaka's daughter Sitā beingalive, O best of men. And as these multitudes of beastsand these jackals are crying frightfully in the flamingdirection,60 I do not know, O thou of mighty strength, whether itis well with that daughter of the king. This Rākshasa, who,wearing the shape of a deer, and, alluring me, had drawn mefar, hath in some sort been slain by me with much ado;and he became a Rākshasa at the time of his death. Yetmy mind is poor and cheerless; and my left eye throbs.Doubtless, O Lakshmana, Sitā is not,—she is either carriedaway, or dead, or is wandering on the way."

O Karnikar, thou appearest very beautiful with thisblossoming flowers, tell me if thou hast seen my deardevoted wife who was fond of thee.\" Thus the highly famousRāma asking about Sitā, nearing the various trees such asmangoe, Nipa, Mahasālā, Panaça, Kurava, Pomegranate,Vakula, Pumnaga, Sandal and Keta began to traverse theforest like a maniac. Again addressed he the diverseanimals—\"O deer, knowest thou for certain about Jānakihaving the eyes of a doe; is she engaged in play with thedoes? O elephant, methinks thou dost know about thedaughter of Janaka having thighs resembling thy trunk;pray tell me if thou hast beheld her. O tiger, fearlessly dothou relate unto me if thou hast seen my beloved Maithilee,having a countenance resembling Moon. O dear! O thouhaving eyes like unto lotuses! why dost thou fly away?Surely have I seen thee. Why dost thou not address mehiding thyself behind the tree? Wait, wait, O thou fairdamsel, thou hast no compassion for me! Never hadst thoumock me before in this way! Why dost thou neglect menow? O exquisitely fair damsel, truly have I found thee outfrom this thy yellow silken cloth. I have seen thee flying away.Stand if thou hast any love for me. Or, O thou having a sweetsmile, thou art not she; truly thou hast been killed or else thouwouldst not have neglected me at this time of dire affliction.True it is that she hath been devoured in my absence by theRākshasas living on flesh having torn into pieces her limbs.Truly hath her face, resembling the full-moon, havingbeautiful teeth a fine nose and white Kundalas, become ofpale countenance being brought under the possession of theRākshasas. Her neck had the hue of sandal and was adornedwith necklace—that beautiful tender neck was eaten up bythe Rākshasas, my beloved wife wailing. Her arms weretender like leaves and adorned with various ornaments; trulyhave the Rākshasas eaten them up, shaken as they were, bythrowing them here and there. Alas! did I leave her aloneonly to be devoured by the Rākshasas? And she hath beeneaten up like one weak and helpless albeit she has manyfriends. O Lakshmana, O thou of mighty-arms, hast thouseen where my dear wife is? O dear! O Sitā! where hastthou gone?\" Bewailing again and again in this strain Rāmabegan to range the forest. Sometimes leaping, sometimeswalking in an uncertain direction, again and again he lookedlike one void of sense. And again intent on searching Sitā hefuriously engaged in traversing the rivers, mountains, fountainsand the woods. He could not wait paitently anywhere.Entering a vast forest he searched every nook and corner forMaithilee; his desire was not satisfied and he again engagedwith great labour in the finding out of his dear spouse."

And finding Sitā nowhere he raised up hisbeautiful arm and broke out into lamentations saying, \"OLakshmana where is Sitā? Where has she gone hence? OSaumitri, who hath carried away my dear one or who hathdevoured her? O Sitā, if wishest thou to mock me, hidingthyself behind the tree, enough—enough it is—console mewho am exercised with grief. O pleasant Sitā, without theethese faithful little deer have engaged in meditation beingbathed in tears. Without Sitā I shall not breathe, OLakshmana. A mighty grief hath overtaken me in consequence ofher being carried away. My father the monarch shall surelybehold me in the next world and ask me 'I engagedthee in the observance of a vow; without fulfilling that, whyhast thou come here? O shame on thee!' For certain shallmy father address me with these words relating to mypassionate, false and base conduct. All my desires have nowbeen baffled and I have lost all control over myself and havebeen exercised with grief. O fine damsel, O thou of slenderwaist, where dost thou repair leaving me behind like untofame renouncing a person of vicious nature? Without theeI shall renounce my own life.\" Being desirous of seeingSitā, Rāma afflicted with grief began to bewail in this strain,but did not behold the daughter of Janaka. Being sunk ingrief on Sitā's account he became worn out like unto anelephant fallen in mud. Thereat for his well being,Lakshmana spoke unto him saying, \"O thou of mighty intellect—do not grieve. Do thou put forth thy endeavours along withme. There is that high hill, O hero, containing many acave. Maithili who is fond of ranging the forest and everdelighteth in beholding the flowery woods, must have enteredtherein or have gone to the watering-place blooming withflowerets and lotuses. She has gone to the river aboundingin fish and Banjulas or has hidden herself somewhere inthe forest to frighten us and to know, O best of men, howwe can search her out. O thou of great beauty, let us soonengage in quest of her. O Kākuthstha, if thinkest thouthat she is somewhere in this forest, we shall leave noquarter untried. Do thou not grieve.\" After Lakshmana hadspoken thus out of fraternal affection, Rāma, with a composedheart, set out along with him in quest of Sitā. Andsearching every nook and corner of the mountains, rivers, ponds,table-lands, hills and summits they found Sitā nowhere. Andsearching thus all the mountains Rāma spake unto Lakshmanasaying \"Behold not I the auspicious Vaidehi on this mountain,O Saumitri.\" Ranging the entire forest of Dandaka,Lakshmana, sore distressed, spake unto his brother of flamingenergy, saying \"Surely shalt thou come by Maithili thedaughter of Janaka like unto the mighty armed Vishnuobtaining this earth after having bound Vāli.\" Being thusaddressed by the heroic Lakshmana, Rāghava, greatly afflictedwith sorrow, replied in piteous accents—\"O thou of mightyintellect I have searched every nook of this forest, this poolabounding in blown lotuses, and this mountain containingmany a cave and fountain; but nowhere have I seen Vaidehidearer than my life.\" Thus bewailing Rāma, racked withsorrow consequent on Sitā, being carried away, becamepoorly and afflicted with grief and swooned away forsometime. He lost his sense and his whole frame was workedwith grief. Being grfeatly anxious and breathless he sighedhot and fast and began to lament. And sobbing again andagain the lotus-eyed Rāma bewailed with his voice chokedwith the vapour of grief, exclaiming \"Ah Sitā!\" Thereat hisdear brother Lakshmana, aggrieved, consoled him with joinedhands. But passing by the words dropping from Lakshmana'slips Rāma again and again bewailed not beholding his dearSitā."

Pierced with the shafts ofManmatha, Rāghava, as if beholding Sitā though he actuallydid not see her, uttered the following piteous accents—\"O mydear, thou delightest greatly in flowers. Covering thy ownperson with Asoka twigs thou art increasing my grief. Thythighs are like unto the trunks of plantain trees and thouhast hidden thyself behind the plantain grove. But Ipercieve thee, O fair one, thou art incapable of keeping thyselfhidden. O auspicious one, thou hast entered smiling theKarnikar grove. No more with thy pastime, O dear one,leading to my death. Moreover it is not proper to sport inthis way in a hermitage. I know it full well, O my dear,that thou art by nature fond of pastimes. But O thou ofexpansive eyes, this cottage lieth desolate, do thou come here.Evident it is that Sitā hath either been devoured by theRākshasas or carried away by them, and therefore she dothnot approach me, O Lakshmana, who am thus bewailing.These deer, O Lakshmana, with tearful eyes have been as ifdeclaring that Sitā hath been devoured by the night-rangers.O chaste one, O thou of exquisitely fine hue, O worshipfulmadam, whither hast thou repaired? O Sitā, truly haththe desire of Kaikeyi been fulfilled to-day. I came out withSitā and shall return home without her. How shall I enteragain that inner apartment void of Sitā? Surely shall thepeople blame me as being cruel and destitute of energy.That I have no prowess hath already been manifested in thedestruction of Sitā. When the king Janaka shall come tome after my return home from exile, to ask me of my welfarehow shall I meet him? And surely shall he be overwhelmedwith grief on his daughter's account when he shall find mewithout Sitā. Blessed is my father since he is in heaven now.I shall not repair to that city protected by Bharata. Withouther even the heaven itself appears to me as desolate. Dothou therefore repair to the city of Ayodhya leaving me in thisforest. By no means shall I breathe without her. Embracinghim warmly do thou tell Bharata, as instructed by me—'Rāma hath given thee permission to administer thiskingdom.' As ordered by me do thou with proper respectsalute all my mothers Kauçalya, Kaikeyi and Sumitrā andprotect them all with great care and respectful compliments.O destroyer of foes, do thou relate at length unto my motherthe story of Sitā's destruction.\" Rāma bewailing thus, beingoverwhelmed with grief on account of his separation fromSitā having a head of fine hair, Lakshmana became of palecountenance and was greatly distressed at heart."

Sunk in the abyss of grief, Rāma, sighing hot andweeping piteously, spoke unto Lakshmana who was equallyaggrieved, words worthy of being said on that occasion.\"Me thinks there is none other on this earth like me, theperpetrator of vicious crimes. My heart or soul is notriven though crushed again and again without respitewith a multitude of doleful events. Surely did Iperpetrate many a vicious deed in my previous birth, thefruit of which I do now suffer and in consequencewhereof misfortune after misfortune hath befallen me. Comingwithin the compass of my remembrance, the loss ofmy kingdom, the death of my father, the separation of mymother and other kinsmen culminates my grief. Repairingunto woods, O Lakshmana, in Sitā's company my grief wasassuaged, nay I did not suffer physical affliction even.Without Sitā these sorrows have grown anew like unto fireflaming again by means of fuel. Truly my wife, timid as sheis, hath been carried away by a Rākshasa by the etherialtrack. Alas I doubtless it is, that one of pleasant accents,wept piteously out of fear many a time and oft. For certainmy dear wife's breast round and sprinkled as it was withred sandal paste, was bathed in blood (while devoured bythe Rākshasas)—but there is no death for me. Thatcountenance the beauty of which was enhanced by ahead of curly hair and which used to emit forth tender,soft and clear accents, hath become pale, being takenpossession of by the Rākshasas like unto the Moon almostdevoured by Rāhu. Surely have the Rākshasas subsistingon gore drunk her blood in the sky tearing oft the neckof my dear one ever devoted to pious observances. Surelydid that one of beautifully expansive eyes cry aloudpoorly like unto a hind when she was drawn hither andthither by the Rākshasas encircling her in the forest in myabsence. O Lakshmana, sitting at the foot of this hill withme that large-hearted, pious Sitā, of smilling countenance,used to address thee on many a topic. This is Godavari,the best of rivers, my dear wife took delight in her—has she gone there?—But she never goes there alone. Or hasJānaki having eyes resembling lotus-petals hath gone to bringlotuses? But how is that possible, she never goes withoutme to bring lotuses. Hath she entered at her pleasurethis forest filled with many flowery trees and diverse birds?But that is not possible too—she is timid and feareth muchto enter alone in this forest. O Aditya, knowest thou thepious and vicious actions of men; beareth thou testimony tothe truth and untruth of their actions—do thou tell me, pray,who am striken with grief, whither hath my dear onerepaired, or whether hath she been killed? O Air, thereis nothing on earth which is not within the compass ofthy vision, do thou relate unto me whether Sitā preservingthe fame of my ancestry, hath been killed or carried awayor if she waiteth on the way.\" After Rāma had bewailedthus being beside himself with grief, Saumitri, ever treadingthe right path and not of poorly mind spoke words worthyof being said on that occasion.—\"Do thou take heartrenouncing thy grief and engage with energy in quest of Sitā.Persons of high energy are never exhausted on the eartheven in the face of arduous works.\" The highly powerfulLakshmana having spoken thus being afflicted with grief,Rāma, the best of Raghu's descendants, did not consider thatworth pondering over.

Reconnoitering full well the river containingmany a watering-place Lakshmana spake unto Rāma saying,\"Searched have I all the watering-places but have foundher nowhere—anon I cried aloud but she did not hear.I cannot trace whither hath Vaidehi of slender waistrepaired ever assuaging our mental affliction.\" HearingLakshmana' s words, Rāma, aggrieved and overwhelmed withsorrow repaired in person to the river Godaveri. Arrivingthere cried he \"Where is Sitā?\" Neither did theworld of creatures nor the river Godaveri apprise Rāmaof Sitā's being carried away by the Lord of Rākshasasworthy of being slain. Thinking of the terrible figure andmonstrous actions of that vicious-souled Rāvana, that riverdid not dare relate unto him anything about Sitā, albeitappointed by the creatures to relate the story concerning herand accosted by Rāma in piteous accents. Being thusdisappointed by the river in beholding Sitā, Rāma racked withher separation spake unto Lakshmana saying \"O thou ofauspicious looks, this river Godavari doth give no reply. ButO Lakshmana, returning without her what shall I say untoJanaka and Vaidehi's mother? Where hath that Vaidehigone who used to assuage my grief who had been deprivedof kingdom and living in this forest on wild fruitsand vegetables? Nights shall appear too long unto me,keeping late hours being deprived of my kinsmen andrelatives and not beholding Vaidehi. I can range thisMandākini, this Janasthāna and this Pasrabana hill if I canfind Sitā there. Behold, O hero, the high deer have beencasting their looks again and again at men; methinks fromtheir gestures, they intend speaking something uoto me.\"Beholding them, Rāghava, the best of men, looked at themand said in accents choked with vapour—\"Where is Sitā?\"Being thus addressed by that Lord of men the deer rose upall on a sudden and looked up to the sky facing thesouth and proceeded to the direction by which Maithilihad been carried away. And moving by that way these deereyed the Lord of men and again and again fixed theirlooks upon that way and earth and passed along emittingcries which was marked by Lakshmana. He marked withattention their movements and cries and spake unto his elderbrother like one aggrieved saying—\"Being accosted by theewith—'Where is Sitā?' these deer have stood up all ona sudden and have been pointing to the south and earth—let us therefore proceed in this direction—it may be thatwe shall either meet with that worshipful madam or findsome mementos concerning her.\" Thereat Kākuthstha, giftedwith supreme beauty, proceeded towards the south beingfollowed by Lakshmana and casting his look upon the earth.While proceeding thus, conversing with each other the twobrothers beheld some flowers scattered on the high-way."

Me thinks the sun, the air and the famedearth have preserved them for my well-being.\" Havingspoken these words unto Lakshmana, the best of men, thevirtuous-souled Rāma, of mighty arms, addressed themountain in front of him containing many fountains, saying—\"0thou the best of mountains, hast thou beheld in thispicturesque forest-land, that exquisitely fine damsel racked withmy separation?\" Exceedingly wroth he accosted themountain like unto a lion addresing a little deer, saying\"Show me my graceful Sitā hued like gold before I crushdown thy summits.\" Being thus addressed by Rāma onMaithili's account the mountain did not show him Sitā.Again addressed him Rāma—\"Thou shalt by the fire of myarrows, be reduced to ashes—thy twigs and leaves shall betotally destroyed and no one shall resort to thee. OLakshmana, I shall dry up this river Godavari if it telleth menot about Sitā having a moon-like countenance.\" Rāma,exceedingly wroth, cast his looks around as if desiring toburn everything with his eyes and beheld footprints of theRākshasas on the earth as well as those of Sitā movingwildly hither and thither, terrified and desirous to see Rāma,while pursued by the Rākshasas. Beholding these footmarks,the snapped bow, the quiver and the chariot broken into manypieces, Rāma, terrified spake unto his dear brother. \"BeholdO, Lakshmana, the remnants of Vaidehi's golden ornaments,strewn hither and thither, and diverse garlands. Behold OSaumitri, the earth covered with drops of blood resemblinggolden drops. Methinks, O Lakshmana, Vaidehi hath beendevoured by the Rākshasas assuming shapes at will, havingsundered her in pieces. O Saumitri, there took place a terribleconflict between the Rākshasas, fighting with each other onSitā's account. O gentle one, whose is this snapped bowlying on the breast of the earth adorned and crested withpearls and diamonds? O brother, this belongs either to thecelestials or to the Rākshasas. Whose is this golden armourlying shattered on earth, resembling the newly risen sun; incolor and adorned with sapphire? Whose is this umbrellalying broken on earth, containing a hundred rod andadorned with celestial garlands? In whose conflict have theseterrible asses, of large proportions, having faces of demonand with breast plates, been killed? Whose is this shatteredwar-car lying upset on the ground and broken flag resemblingin lustre the burning gold? Whose are these terriblearrows feathered in gold, measuring four-hundred fingers,lying without blades on earth? Behold, O Lakshmana, thesetwo quivers have been totally spoiled though filled with arrows.Whose charioteer is this who hath been killed with reinsand lash in hands? These foot-marks must be someRākshasa's. I made these Rākshasas my fatal enemies,assuming shapes at will and of crooked hearts. Poor Sitāmust have been either dead, carried away by them or devoured.Virtue did not save her from being carried away in thismighty forest. O Lakshmana, while virtue did not protectJānaki being devoured or taken away by stealth, what personelse gifted with heavenly power, on this earth shall bringabout my well-being? For this it is that people throughignorance disregard the ever kind Almighty—the lord ofcreatures and the best of the celestials. Truly shall the celestialsregard me as one devoid of prowess, who am mild-tempered,kind, ever engaged in the welfare of the humanity, and havecontrolled all my senses. Observe, O Lakshmana, obtainingme as the stay these accomplishments have been turnedinto so many blemishes. Truly shall my prowess manifestitself to-day overshadowing all my other accomplishmentsfor the destruction of the Rākshasas and all createdbeings like unto the rising of the Sun casting the Moon intoshade on the day of dissolution. None shall enjoy felicity,O Lakshmana,—Yakshas, Gandharbas, Picachas, Rākshasas,Kinnaras, or human beings. Today shall the welkin befilled up with my arrows. Motionless shall I make all theanimals inhabiting the three worlds. I shall arrest themovement of the planets and overshadow the Moon. Stoppingthe course of the wind and destroying the rays of the Sunand fire I shall envelope the earth with darkness, crush downthe summits of the mountains, dry up the pools, blow up thecreepers, demolish the Ocean and erradicate the trees. Ifthe celestials do not give me back my Sitā I shall bringabout the dissolution of the three worlds which would elsehave been wrought by time. O son of Sumitrā, instantlyshall the celestials headed by Indra, meet with my prowess,if they do not give back my Sitā, ever advancing mywellfare. None shall be able to range the welkin. BeholdLakshmana, being perpetually crushed down by myarrow's shot off my bow, the world shall be disturbed anddislodged and the animals and birds shall be confused anddestroyed. Stretching the bow to my ears I shall make theworld, for Sitā's sake, void of Pisachas and Rākshasas withmy arrows incapable of being withstood by created beings.To-day shall the celestials behold the power of my arrowscoursing a long distance shot through my ire. Threeworlds destroyed on account of my wrath, celestials,Dānavas, Pisachas or Rākshasas,—none shall be saved. Thedwellings of the celestials, Asuras, Yakshas and Rākshasasshall fall down sundered by my arrows into diverse pieces.I shall dislodge the whole world by my arrows. If thecelestials do not give me back my Vaidehi dead or carriedaway or as she was before, I shall destroy the wholeworld mobile or immobile and disturb all with my arrowsuntil I see her.\" Having spoken thus, Rāma, with his eyesreddened with ire and lips swollen, tying fast his bark anddeer-skin, braided his matted locks. Having done this, beingexceedingly wroth he looked like Rudra about to destroyTripura. Thereat taking his bow from Lakshmana andholding it fast, the effulgent Rāma, the conqueror of foes,fixed flaming arrows to it like so many serpents and saidbeing exercised with ire like unto fire on the eve ofdissolution.—\"O Lakshmana none shall be able to withstandme, who am inflamed with rage, as debility consequenton old age, death, time, duty are incapable of being avertedfrom their destined ends by the animals. I shall bring abouta mighty revolution in the world containing the celestialsGandharba, human beings, Pannagas and the mountains, if Ido not get back, in her pristine beauty, my Sitā, the daughterof the King of Mithilā.\""

It is thy duty, O king, withbow in hand to search out the person who hath carried awaySitā, along with me and the devotees. Explore shall we, withgreat care, the seas, the forest, the mountains, the fearful caves,the pools and the abodes of the celestials and Gandharbasuntil we find out the person who hath carried away thy wife.If the celestials do not return thee peacefully thy wife, OLord cf Koçala, thou shalt adopt measures, befittingthe occassion.

  "Āranya, Kishkindhā, and Sundara Kāndam": "Beholding Yatāyu fallen on the ground by the terribleRākshasa, Rāma spoke unto Lakshmana, having compassionfor all, saying \"Verily for my service this bird hath breathedits last, being killed by the Rākshasa. O Lakshmana, itsvoice hath been enfeebled, its vision weakened and its life,greatly exhausted, lieth in a very little proportion in itsbody. May good betide thee, O Yatāyu; if thou art capablespeaking again, do thou relate how Sitā hath been carriedaway and thou hast been killed. Why hath Rāvana takenaway by stealth the worshipful Jānaki? What offence didI commit by him that he hath carried away my dear one?O thou best of birds, how looked the moon-like, pleasantcountenance of Sitā at the time of her being carried away?What did she speak then? What is the prowess, appearanceand action of that Rākshasa? Where doth he live,O reverend Sir? Pray tell me, I do ask thee.\" BeholdingRāma, lament like one helpless, the virtuous-souled Yatāyuspake in faltering accents—\"Sitā hath been carried awayby Rāvana, the lord of Rākshasas, creating a mighty illusionproducing wind and showers. O darling, myself being wornout that night-ranger, having sundered my wings, fled awaywith Sitā to the southerly direction. O Rāghava, my life isabout to expire, my eye-sight hath grown of mistakenperception, I see trees before me made of gold having hairresembling Ushira.62 Rāvana hath taken away Sitā at amoment when a person regains soon his lost property. OKākuthstha, this moment is called Vindya,63 which Rāvanahath not been able to perceive. (At this moment) the personwho taketh away (a thing) is soon destroyed like unto a fishdevouring a hook. Do not therefore entertain the least doubtabout thy coming by Jānaki. Destroying him at the headof the battle thou shalt soon sport with Vaidehi.\"Thereupon flesh and gore began to come out of the mouth ofYatāyu, the king of vultures, not loosing his sense evenwhile treading the verge of death. Thereupon the king of birdsgave up his dear life uttering only.—\"Rāvana is the sonof Vishravā and brother to Vaishravana (the lord of wealth).\"Rāma again and again addressed him with joined palmssaying, \"Do thou speak! Do thou speak.\" And instantly Yatāyu'svital spark rose up in the sky, leaving his bodily frame.Thereupon the king of vultures fell down on the earth bystretching forth his legs, body and head on the ground.Beholding the vulture dead, of huge proportions, resemblinga hill and having red eyes, Rāma, aggrieved, spokepiteously unto Saumitri, saying—\"Living happily, for years,in this forest of Dandaka inhabited by the Rākshasas, Yatāyuhath, at last, given up his life. He lived for a long time, ofan uplifted person, and hath now laid low on the earth.None can withstand the course of destiny. Observe,Lakshmana, this vulture for my benefaction, hath been killedby the powerful Rāvana in his attempt to rescue Sitā. Forme, hath this Lord of birds, breathed his last, renouncing hislarge ancestral kingdom. In every status of animal creation,the heroic, the righteous and the honest, affording refugeunto all, are to be found, even amongst the birds. I do notfeel so much affliction, O hero, for Sitā's ravishment as Ido for this vulture, who hath been killed for me. Like untothe highly famous, effulgent king Daçaratha, this King ofof birds is worthy of being adored and worshipped by me.O Saumitri, do thou bring fuels; I shall produce firetherewith and burn the dead body of this king of birds who hathbeen killed on my account. Placing on a funeral pile, Ishall cremate, O Saumitri, the dead body of this king of birdswho hath been destroyed by the grim-visaged Rākshasas.Being consecrated and commanded by me, do thou, O highlypowerful king of birds, attain to that excellent state ofexistence, which is reached by persons ever performing piousobservances, by Ahitagnis64 by heroes who are not afraidof entering a battle-field and by persons who confer grantsof land.\" Saying this the virtuous-souled Rāma, afflictedwith sorrow, burned the body of the king of birds, placingit on the funeral pile, like unto his own kinsman. Enteringthe forest with Saumitri, Rāma gifted with prowess, killedplump high deer and stretched forth grass and twigs foroffering oblation to that bird. Taking off the flesh of thosehigh deer and clustering it, Rāma, of great renown, offered itto the vultures in that pleasant forest-land, abounding ingreen grass. Thereupon for his speedy arrival at the abode ofcelestials, Rāma recited those Mantras which are beinguttered by the twice-born ones. Afterwards repairing to theriver Gadāveri the two princes offered water unto that kinglyvulture. And offering water unto him according to theprescribed rites of the Sastras, those two descendants ofRaghu, after bathing, performed the Udaka65 ceremony forthat king of vultures. Having been killed in battle for anarduous but glorious work, that king of vultures, consecratedby the ascetic-like Rāma, attained to an excellent state.Having performed the Udaka ceremony for that best of birdsand considering him in the light of a father they went awayand entered the forest in quest of Sitā like unto the twobest of celestials—Visnu and Vasava."

  "Āranya, Kishkindhā, and Sundara Kāndam": "Having offered him the gift of water, those twodescendants of Raghu wended their way in that forest in quest ofSitā and proceeded towards the south-west.66 Then turning tothe south, with bow and arrows in hand, they reached a tracknot wended by the people. It was a ghastly, impenetrableforest, covered on all sides with groves, trees and creepers.Proceeding by the southerly direction, those two mightyones, passed hastily by that terrible, dreary forest.Thereupon, the highly effulgent descendants of Raghu entered thedense forest of Krauncha, situated at a distance of six milesfrom Janasthāna. It was a dense forest like unto acollection of clouds, as if smiling on all sides blooming withcharming flowers of diverse hues and frequented by variousanimals and birds. Waiting for sometime here and therethey, exercised with Sitā's ravishment, explored the entireforest in quest of Vaidehi. Proceeding three Krosas towardsthe East and passing by the forest of Krauncha the twobrothers descried on their way the asylum of Matanga.Having seen that dreary forest frequented by variousanimals and birds and covered with diverse trees and densegroves, the two sons of Daçaratha beheld a cave in themountain, deep as the region under the earth and everenveloped with darkness. Arriving there they espied hardby a grim visaged Rākshasi, having a formidable figure,ever causing fright unto persons of feeble courage,loathesome, terrible-looking, having a huge belly, sharpenedteeth, a high person and rough skin, devouring voraciousanimals and looking fearful with dishevelled hair. Beholdingthere the two brothers, Rāma and Lakshmana, she nearedthe heroes and saying, 'come, we shall sport' assailedLakshmana who had been going before his brother. Andembracing him she spake unto Saumitri the followingwords—\"My name is Ayomukhee; it is a great gain tothee that thou hast become my beloved one, O my lord. Dothou sport with me, for ever, O hero, in these mountainousstrongholds and on the banks of the rivers.\" Thereat,exercised with ire, Lakshmana, the subduer of foes, uplifting hisdagger, chopped off her nose, ears and breast. Having hernose and ears cut off, that terrible-looking Rākshasi, emittingfearful cries, fled away whence she had come. On herdeparture, proceeding quickly, the two brothers, Rāma andLakshmana, the conquerors of foes, reached a dense forest.Thereupon the highly effulgent and truthful Lakshmana, possessinga pure character, spake, with folded hands, unto his brother offlaming energy—\"My left arm is throbbing, my mind is filledwith anxiety and I perceive before me many a bad omen. Dothou put on thy habiliments, O worshipful one, and act bywhat I say for thy well-being. Methinks from these badomens some calamity shall soon befall us. O Rāma, thisterrible bird Banchulaka is emitting fearful cries as ifannouncing our victory in the conflict.\" Thereupon whilethey began to explore the entire forest with their prowessthere arose a terrible sound as if breaking down the wood.The forest was enveloped on all sides with a mighty windand everywhere was audible a roar filling the wood-land.With a view to ascertain whence the sound proceeded,Rāma, with a dagger in hand, along with his younger brother,espied a Rākshasha of huge proportions, having big thighs.The two brothers beheld that Rākshasa stationed beforethem, having a huge body, devoid of head and neck andtherefore a headless demon and having its mouth on itsbelly. Its body resembled a huge mountain and was coveredwith sharpened down; its look was terrible like unto sablecloud and its roar resembled the muttering where of. Itsone terrible, expansive eye, seeing all, was on theforehead placed on its breast and shone forth like unto theflaming fire and it had huge yellow eye-lashes. Its mouthwas greatly widened and covered with rows of huge teethand it was again and again licking that terrible mouth. Andstretching forth its two huge arms extending over a yojanait was devouring bears, lions and deer. It was catching andthrowing with its huge hands many an animal, bird and bear.Hindering the way-fare it was awaiting those two brothers.And proceeding a Krosa, they espied that fearful,grim-visaged, headless demon, hindering all creatures with its arms,terrible-looking and appearing like a kavanda from its verysituation. Thereupon that one, of huge arms, stretchingthem forth, got hold of those two descendants of Raghucrushing them with its strength. Those two highlypowerful brothers, of mighty arms, with daggers andbows in their hands, were assailed and got hold of by thatRākshasha. Rāma was heroic and patient by nature andconsequently was not much afflicted; but Lakshmana was amere boy and impatient by nature and was consequentlygreatly afflicted. Being greatly distressed, the youngerbrother of Rāghava spake unto him, saying \"Do thou beholdme, O hero, brought under the hold of this Rākshasha, andre-nouncing me only, O Rāghava, do thou get thyself off.And offering me as sacrifice, do thou escape at thy ease.Methinks for certain, O Kākuthstha, thou shalt soon come byVaidehi and regain thy anscestral kingdom. But rememberme always, O Rāma, when thou shalt find thyself placed on thethrone.\" Being thus addressed by Lakshmana, Rāma spakeunto Saumitri—\"Fear not in vain, O hero; persons of thyprowess are never afflicted (with fear).\" Meanwhile thewicked headless, demon, of huge arms, the foremost ofDānaves, addressed the two brothers Rāma and Lakshmana—\"Who are ye two youthful figures having the neck of abull and with mighty daggers and bows in your hands?Arriving in this fearful place ye have by chance come withinthe compass of my vision. Tell me now what have ye todo here, and what for have ye come? I have been waitinghere being hungry, and ye have come here having daggersand bows with arrows in your hands like unto two oxenhaving sharpened horns. Nearing me quickly, it will behard for ye to draw your vital breath.\" Hearing thosewords of the vicious-souled Kavandha, Rāma having hiscountenance dried up, bespake Lakshmana—\"O thou,having truth for thy prowess, again and again, greater andworse calamities have been threatening us. We havealready met with a dire disaster leading to our death,consequent on my separation from my dear one. Mighty is thecourse of Destiny in all creatures, O Lakshmana. Do thouO best of men, behold even thyself and me stricken withcalamity. But O Lakshmana it is not very difficult fordestiny to afflict all creatures. Under the influence ofdestiny even the mighty heroes, well habited in armoursare distressed like unto a bridge of sands.\" Addressingthese words unto Saumitri, the resolute, powerful and highlyfamous son of Daçaratha, having truth for his prowess,composed himself by dint of his own understanding."

O ye having lost your sense, ye havebeen chosen by Destiny as my food.\" Hearing those wordsLakshmana, sore distressed and determined to display hisvalour, addressed Rāma with words worthy of being said onthat occasion. \"This vile Rākshasa shall seize both of us;let us sunder soon its two huge arms with our daggers.This grim-visaged Rākshasa, of huge proportions, gifted onlywith the strength of arms, defeating all other persons, hathaddressed itself at last to destroy us. It is odious for theKshatryas to make away with those who cannot defendthemselves like unto animals brought for sacrifice.\"67Hearing their conversation, the Rākshasa, inflamed with rage,widening its terrible mouth, prepared to devour themup.68 Thereat Rāma and Lakshmana, cognizant of time andplace, pleased,69 sundered its arms off its shoulders withtheir daggers. Rāma, stationed on the right side70 cut off inno time its right arm with his dagger and the heroicLakshmana, the left one. Having got its arms dissevered, theterrible-voiced, Kavandha, of huge arms,roaring like unto themuttering of clouds and resounding the heaven, earth andall the quarters, fell flat on the ground. Beholding both itsarms cut off, the demon, with its person bathed in blood,asked them poorly—\" Who are ye?\" Being thus accosted byKavandha, the mighty Lakshmana, gifted with auspiciousmarks, spake unto it, about Kākuthstha. \"He is a descendantof the Ikshwākus known on earth by the name of Rāma, andknow me as his younger brother, by name—Lakshmana.Being thwarted by mother (Kaikeyi) in his accession ofkingdom, he, renouncing all, hath fled as an exile unto woods,and hath, along with me and his spouse, been ranging thisforest. While living in the dense forest the wife of Rāma,effulgent like unto the celestials hath been ravished by aRākshasa. Searching her, have we come here. Who artthou? And what for art thou ranging this forest like untoa headless demon, having thy thighs broken and thy flamingface placed on thy breast?\" Being thus addressed byLakshmana with these goodly words, Kavandha, pleased,recollecting the words of Indra, bespake him,—\"O two bestof men, ye are welcome! By my good luck it is that I dobehold you. By my good fortune ye have dissevered myshoulders to-day. Do ye hear. I shall relate truly unto youhow have I, by my haughtiness, come by this unsightly shape.\""

Onceon a time assuming this terrible shape I assailed andenraged the great ascetic Sthulashira collecting diversewild fruits. Thereupon he imprecated curses upon me,saying \"Do thou retain this ghastly shape hated of allmankind.\" Upon my praying unto that angry ascetic formy relief from that curse, he said—\"Thou shalt regain thystalwart and beautiful shape when thou shalt be burnt byRāma in a dense forest having got thy arms dissevered byhim. O Lakshmana, know me to be the beautiful son ofDanu. Through Indra's curse in the battle field I have beenmetamorphosed into my present shape. After I had pleasedhim with hard austerites, the Grand-Father of the celestialsconferred on me a long life. And therefore I was inflamed withpride and assailed Indra in a conflict, thinking within me,'I have gained a long life—what can Indra do me?'Thereupon by his thunderbolt, having hundred edges, hurledoff his hands, my thighs were shattered and my headthrusted into my body. Myself praying for the close of mylife, he did not despatch me to the abode of Yama. He onlysaid \"May the words of the Grand Sire prove true.\"Whereto I replied 'How shall I live long without any food, beingsmitten by thee having a thunderbot in thy hand, and havingmy head, thighs and mouth crushed down?' Thereat Indramade my hands extending over a Yajana and placed mymouth, having sharpened teeth, on my belly. Thenceforth,stretching out my long arms I used to devour all lions,tigers, wolves and deer ranging the forest. Indra saidto me, Thou shalt attain to heaven when Rāma, along withLakshmana, shall cut off thy arms in a battle.' Actingunder the conviction that Rāma, resolved to destroymy person, shall surely come within the compass of my arms,I do always assail with relish, O worshipful one, O thoubest of kings, every animal I meet with in this forest. Thouart that Rāma. May good betide thee, O Rāghava. Verilydid the great ascetic speak unto me that none should beable to assail me but Rāma. Being cremated by you, I shallcounsel you best and tell you with whom you shouldcontract friendship.\" Being thus addressed by Danu, thevirtuous-souled Rāghava spake before listening Lakshmana,\"My renowned spouse Sitā was easily ravished by Rāvanaafter I had gone out of Janasthāna along with my brother.I know that Rākshasa's name only—but do not know hiswhereabouts, his figure and his prowess. It behoveth theeto show proper compassion for us, who have been strickenwith grief, who are helpless, have been ranging this forestin this way and are ever engaged in the well-being ofothers71 O, hero, we shall burn thee after collecting all thebranches that have been broken down by the elephants anddried up in time, and digging a big trench. Do thou tell uswho hath carried away Sitā? And where? If dost thou knowit truly do thou perform us this good service.\" Thereatthe Rākshasa, skilled in speech, spake unto Rāghava,addressing him thus—\"I am not gifted with divine fore-sight andtherefore do not know where Maithilee is. I shall let youknow of him who shall be able to tell you all about her,after I resume my original shape, being burnt (by thee). Ishall furthermore tell thee, O Rāma, who knows thatRākshasa. Without being burnt I am incapable of beingcognizant of that highly powerful Rākshasa who hath carriedaway thy Sitā. By the influence of curse, I have lost myfore-sight and by my own improper actions I have beentransformed into this ugly figure. Do thou cremate meaccording to the prescribed rites after throwing me into theditch before the sun, with his worn out carriers descends intothe western horizon. Being burnt by thee in the ditch, withdue ceremonials, O descendant of Raghu, I shall mention,unto thee, one who knows that Rākshasa.

Lakshmana kindled the funeral pile,which was ablaze on all sides. Thereupon the firebegan to burn down slowly the huge and corpulent body ofKavandha like unto a lump of clarified butter. Afterwardsthe highly powerful demon, shaking the funeral pile, roseup quickly like a smokeless flame of fire, wearing a cleancloth and a celestial garland. And the graceful demon,wearing an unsullied cloth and having all its limbs crestedwith diverse ornaments, rose from the pile high up in thewelkin with a delighted heart.

There are sixexpedients,73 O Rāma, by virtue of which kings acquire allobjects. He, in whom misfortune hath culminated, shouldseek the company of one such.74 Thou hast, O Rāma alongwith Lakshmana, met with the culmination of misfortuneand for which thou hast been assailed with such adisaster as the ravishment of thy spouse. O thou best ofmy friends, it behoveth thee, therefore to make friends withsuch a person. Or else I do not find any means for thysuccess. Do thou hear, O Rāma, what I relate. There livethwith four monkeys a heroic, self-controlled monkey by nameSugriva, on that best of mountains Rishyamuka, situated onthe banks of the lake Pampā, being driven by his enragedbrother Vāli, the son of Indra. That mighty, powerful,effulgent lord of monkeys, of immeasurable prowess and truthfulvows, humble, patient, intelligent, great, expert, bold,graceful and puissant, hath been banished by his brother, O hero,for kingdom. Surely he shall befriend and assist thee inthy search for Sitā. Do thou not plunge thy soul in grief.O thou best of Ikshwākus, none can withstand destiny onthis earth, truly unavoidable is it course. Do thou proceedsoon, O hero, to Sugrivā of mighty prowess, and repairinghence even to-day do thou contract friendship with him,taking vow in the presence of flaming fire75 that ye shall notenvy each other. Despise not that kingly monkey Sugrivā,because he is grateful, capable of assuming shapes at will,seeking protection and powerful. Ye too are able toaccomplish his wished-for object. Benefitted by thee or not, heshall engage in thy service. He was begotten of the Sununto the wife of Rikhyraja. He hath been roaming thebank of Pāmpa being in constant fear of Vāli after creatingenmity with him. Do thou make friends with that monkeyranging the wood and inhabiting the Rishyamuka mountainafter placing thy weapon in the very presence of fire asa witness, because that best of monkeys knoweth minutelyall the abodes of Rākshasas, living on human flesh. Thereis no place under the sun of many rays, O Rāghava, Oslayer of foes, unknown to him. Exploring, with all hismonkeys, the rivers, huge mountains, strongholds and caves,he shall learn about thy spouse. He shall search thatexquisitely fine damsel Maithili in Rāvana's abode,bewailing on thy separation; and to find her out he shalldespatch, O Rāghava, many a monkey of huge proportions tovarious quarters. Whether on the summit of the mountMeru or in the region under the earth, that lord of monkeys,shall give thee back thy blameless spouse, killing all theRākshasas.\""

  "Āranya, Kishkindhā, and Sundara Kāndam": "Having pointed out unto Rāma the expedient forfinding out Sitā the wise Kavandha began with the followingsignificant words:—\"This is the way, O Rāma, leading tothe mount Rishyamuka, where stand, beautifying the West,the Jambu,76 Priāla,77 Panaca,78 Nagrodha,79 Plaksha,80Tinduka,81 Ashathya,82 Karnikar,83 Chuta,84 Nāga,85Tilaka,86 Naktamal,87 Neelashok,88 Cadamva,89 Karavira,90Agnimukhya,91 Asoka, Raktachandan,92 Pāribhadraka,93and many other trees. Ascending those trees or loweringthem by force on earth, do thou proceed living on those fruitslike unto ambrosia. Passing by this forest, O Kākuthstha,thou shalt reach another abounding in trees bloomingwith flowers like unto the garden of celestials and Uttarkuruwhere in all the months of the year the trees produce fruitsand honey and where all the seasons dwell as in the forestof Chaitkraratha.94 There stand beautifully many a treelowered down with the burden of fruits, containing toweringbranches, dense as a collection of clouds or a mountain.Ascending those trees and lowering them, Lakshmana shalloffer thee, fruits like unto ambrosia. O heroes, ranging fromforest to forest, from high mountains to hillocks, ye shallget at the lake Pampā, void of gravels and acquatic plantsand hence there is no danger of falling down to the people,having level watering-places, covered with sands andblooming with red and white lotuses. There emit forth musicalnotes, swans, frogs, cranes and ospreys sporting in thelake Pampā. They are not filled with terror in viewof human beings, inexperienced as they are in the matter ofdestruction. O Rāghava, do ye fare on those plump birdslike unto a lump of clarified butter and diverse fishes such asRohita,95 Chakratunda,96 and Nala.97 O Rāma, the devotedLakshmana, shall offer unto thee, various other best fishes,devoid of scale and fins, plump, filled with bones, havingdestroyed them with shafts and roasted them in fire. Andafter thou hadst feasted on them, Lakshmana shall bringthee water for drinking on a lotus leaf, smelling like a lotus,coming in contact with flowers, delicious, pleasantly cold,wholesome, void of impurities, transparent like silver andcrystal. And while roaming in the evening he shall pointout unto thee fat monkeys ranging in the wood and lying inthe hollows of mountains. And thou too, O best of men, shaltbehold those fat monkeys, who had drunk water, roaringlike unto oxen appearing on the banks of a river to drinkwater. And rambling in the evening, thou shalt assuage thygrief beholding the pleasant water of Pampā and blossomingtrees. There, O Rāghava, the Tilakas and Naktamalakas,crested with flowers and full blown white and red lotuses shallmitigate thy sorrows. There liveth no person who wearsgarlands of those flowers. Garlands strung with thoseflowers never wither away, O Rāghava, because the disciplesof the great ascetic Matanga lived there with concentratedhearts. Drops of perspiration, falling on the earth fromthe persons of those ascetics worn out with the burdenof the wild fruits collected by them for their spiritualguide, have been transformed by virtue of their asceticismunto these garlands. These garlands do never wither, ORāghava, because of their origination from those drops ofperspiration. Even at the present day, O Kākuthstha, thereliveth an immortal mendicant woman, by name Savari, whohad waited in attendance upon those departed ones.Beholding thee, O Rāma,who art adored of all creatures likeunto the Deity Himself, that mendicant woman, everengaged in pious observances, shall attain to the abode ofcelestials. O Rāma, turning to the western bank ofPāmpa, thou shalt, O Kākuthshtha, behold theincomparable and secret asylum of Matanga. Fearing the divineauthority of that great ascetic Matanga, the elephants,though there are many, dare not cross the threshold of hisasylum. O Rāghava, this forest is widely known asMatanga-wood. Thou shalt sport, O Rāma, with a delighted heartin that forest resembling the celestial garden—Nandanaand filled with various birds. There stands in front ofPampā the highly inaccessible mount Rishyamuka,ornamented with many a blossoming tree and guarded on all sides bylittle serpents. That mount is highly munificient. It wascreated by Brahmā in the days of yore. A person, sleepingon the summit of that hill and dreaming of an accessionof wealth, really gets at it after the dream is over. Aperpetrator of iniquitous deeds and engaged in impious observancesascending that hill, the Rākshasas seize upon him, asleep,and bruise him. Thou shalt hear the terrible roar of theyoung elephants ranging in the asylum of Matanga,situated on the banks of Pampā. Thou shalt furthermoreobserve many a quickly moving, infuriated elephant,resembling clouds in hue and with red temporal juice oozing out oftheir heads, roaming here and there sometimes separatelyand again in a band. Those mighty elephants, roamingthe forest, return to their woody homes, drinking thepleasant, pure and sweet smelling water of Pampā. And dothou assuage thy grief, beholding there the bears, wolvesand Rurus of a tender countenance like unto sapphire, whoare harmless and never afraid of human beings. Thereis a huge cave, O Rāma, in that mountain, covered on allsides with rocks and where it is very hard to enter. At theentrance of that cave lies a beautiful, wide lake of cool water,hedged on all sides with trees abounding in fruits. Thereliveth with other monkeys the virtuous-souled Sugriva, whosometimes resideth on the summit of the hill.\" Having thusaddressed Rāma and Lakshmana, Kavandha, highlypowerful resembling the sun in effulgence and wearing garlandsappeared beautiful on the sky. Thereupon Rāma andLakshmana, preparing to proceed spoke unto that great onestationed in the sky, saying, \"Do thou go.\" WheretoKavandha replied, saying \"Do ye proceed to make goodyour end\" and bidding them adieu, who were well pleased,departed. Regaining his pristine beauty and shining ingrace and effulgence that Kavandha, who was on the sky,fixing his looks upon Rāma, and pointing out unto him hisway, said \"Do thou make friends with (Sugriva)\"."

Getting at thatcharming hermitage covered on all sides with trees and castingtheir looks around they beheld that female mendicant—Savari. No sooner had that one of perfect asceticismbeheld those highly intelligent Rāma and Lakshmana thanshe rose up with folded hands and touching their feet offeredthem duly water for washing their feet and mouth.Thereupon Rāma spake unto that female ascetic, engaged inreligious services, saying, \"O thou of sweet accents, hastthou got all hindrances to asceticism removed? Is thyasceticism growing stronger every day? O thou havingasceticism for thy wealth, hast thou restricted thy angerand fare? Hast thou observed the commandments andattained to mental felicity? Hast thy attendance upon thyspiritual guide borne fruits?\" Being thus accosted by Rāmathat old Savari, of accomplished asceticism and recognisedby the Sidhas, approaching Rāma spake:—\"Favoured withthy presence my asceticism hath attained to itsconsummation. Blessed is my birth, fruitful is my service unto myspiritual guides and accomplished is my asceticism.

O gentle one,slayer of foes, thou that dost confer honors on men,thyself casting thy auspicious looks upon me, consecratedI, by thy favour, shall attain to the imperishable landof celestials. On thy setting foot on the mount Chitrakuta,the ascetics whom I served, ascending celestial cars ofincomparable lustre, departed to heaven. Those great ascetics,cognizant of virtue, said to me, \"Rāma shall come to thyholy asylum. Do thou receive with great reverence thatguest together with Lakshmana. On beholding him, thou shaltattain to that best land of the celestials whence nonereturneth. O best of men, I was thus told, by those great ascetics,and for thee I have collected various wild fruits growingon the banks of Pampā.\" Being thus addressed by Savari,the virtuous-souled Rāghava spake unto her conversant withthe knowledge of past and future, saying, \"I have heard fromDanu, in truth, about thy divine authority as well as thatof thy spiritual guides. If thou purposest so I wish towitness it with my own eyes.\" Hearing these accentsdropping from Rāma's lips, Savari showing unto them the vastforest said, \"Do thou behold, O Rāghava, this forest, crowdedwith deer and birds resembling a dense cloud. This forestis known as Matanga's wood. Here in this forest thepure-souled preceptors sacrificed unto fire their personsconsecrated by the Mantras as Mantra itself. This is that altarPratyaksthali, ascending which my worshipful preceptorsused to offer flowers unto the deities with hands tremblingwith toil. Behold, O best of Raghus, this altar ofincomparable beauty, by virtue of their asceticism, hath been stillshedding its lustre on all the sides. Behold, again, the sevenseas have appeared here in conjunction, at their very thought,worn out with fasts and therefore incapable of moving on.Even those barks, which they used to place on these treesafter ablution have not yet been dried up. These flowers,of blue colour which they offered unto the deities, beingengaged in divine services, have not yet been witheredaway. Thou hast observed this entire forest and heardevery thing worth hearing. I purpose now to renounce mybody being commanded by thee. I wish to approach thosepure-souled ascetics, whom I used to wait upon, and whomthese asylums belong to. Hearing with Lakshmana thespeech of that pious one, Rāma gained an excess of joy andexclaiming, \"Wonderful it is!\" again spake unto Savariof keen austerities,—\"O gentle one, I have been worshippedby thee. Do thou repair at thy ease and pleasure.\" Beingthus addressed and ordered by Rāma, Savari, wearingmatted locks, rags and the skin of an antelope, surrenderedherself unto fire and rose high up in the welkin like ontoblazing fire. Adorned with celestial ornaments, wreathedwith celestial garlands, sprinkled with sandal-paste andwearing celestial cloth she appeared of exquisite grace andlighted up the quarters like unto lightning. By virtue of herdevout meditation, Savari repaired to that holy region whendwelt her spiritual preceptors—the pure-hearted ascetics."

  "Āranya, Kishkindhā, and Sundara Kāndam": "After Savari had repaired unto heaven by virtue of herdivine prowess, Rāma with his brother Lakshmana beganto ponder over the pious influence of those great ascetics.Thinking within himself about the divine authority of thosegreat ones, the virtuous-souled Rāma spake unto Lakshmana,devoted and ever engaged in his well-being.—\"Beheld haveI, O gentle one, the wondrous asylum of the pure-souledascetics filled with diverse birds and tigers ramblingfriendly with antelopes. O Lakshmana, we have performedablutions in the sacred waters of these seven seas and offeredoblations unto our manes. Our misfortunes have ended andprosperity hath appeared and my mind is now filled withecstacy of delight. Me-thinks, best of men, auspiciousnessshall soon appear unto us; do thou come, therefore, we shallproceed towards the picturesque lake Pampā. Yonappeareth in view, at no distance, the mount Rishyamuka. Heredwells with four monkeys, the virtuous-souled Sugriva—Suryya's son, in constant fear of Vāli. I am in a hurry tobehold Sugriva the best of monkeys, for my business—Sitā'squest—is entirely at his hands.\" Unto the heroic Rāma,speaking thus, Saumitri said.—\"Let us depart soon, I am in hastetoo.\" Issuing out of Matanga's asylum, the mighty Rāma, lordof men, repaired with Lakshmana to the lake Pampā.Exercised with grief, he arrived at the bank of that best of lakes,beholding (as he passed along), vaious trees and pools, themighty forest covered on all sides with huge trees and flowersand resounding with the noise of lapwings, peacocks,woodpeckers and various other birds and rattling of the bamboos.Beholding, from distance, Pampā of sweet, cool and purewater, Rāma performed ablution at the Matanga Sara (aportion of Pampā) and paced slowly towards the lake.Thereupon Daçaratha's son, stricken with grief, bathed inPampā, covered with lotuses. It was adorned on all sideswith Tilakas, Asokas, Punagas, Uddalas and Vakulas. Itwas a lake girt on all sides with pictueresque gardens,having its waters undulating beautifully and transparentlike unto crystal, and covered all around with soft sands.It was filled with fish and tortoise, adorned with trees on itsbanks, encircled with creepers embracing her likecompanions and frequented by Gandharbas, Kinnaras, serpents,Yakshas and Rāshasas. It was covered with trees andcreepers of various kind, of cool water, and envelopedwith beauty. It was, somewhere, of red hue, in contactwith water lillies, somewhere white with Kumudas,somewhere blue with blue lotuses like unto a blanket ofdiverse hues. It was filled with white and red lotuses andencircled with blossoming mangoe groves and resoundingwith the music of the peacocks. Beholding Pampā,ornamented like a damsel with Tilakas, Bijapuras,98 fig-trees,Sukladrumas,99 flowery Karavis, blossoming Punnagas,groves of Malati100 and Kunda,101 Vandhiras,102 Nichulas,103Asokas, Saptaparuas,104 Ketakas,105 Atimuktas,106 andvarious others trees, Rāma the mighty son of Daçaratha beganto lament with Lakshmana. \"There stands on its bank themount Rishyamuka, abounding in various metals andcovered with trees of varieagated flowers as mentionedbefore (by Kavandha). There dwelleth the famous lord ofmonkeys, Sugrivā, the heroic son of the great Rikshyaraja.O best of men, do thou approach the chief of monkeys.\"Rāma, having truth for his prowess, again spake untoLakshmana, saying, \"O Lakshmana, how shall I livewithout Sitā, who have been deprived of my kingdom, who ampoorly and have Sitā for my life?\" Having said this untoLakshmana, who had nothing else in view, that best ofRaghus, racked with sorrow and grief and oppressed byCupid, entered the lake Pampā graced with lotuses.Proceeding slowly, observing the forest, Rāma beheld and enteredwith Lakshmana Pampā, girt on all sides with beautifulwoods and filled with a multitude of diverse birds."

  "Āranya, Kishkindhā, and Sundara Kāndam": "Repairing with Lakshmana to the lake Pampā filled withred and white lotuses and fish Rāma having his sensesagitated began to lament. And beholding there that lake his senseswere stirred with delight. Troubled with passion he spakeunto Saumitri saying,—\"Behold, O Saumitri, how beautifullyappeareth Pampā of transparent water like unto Baidurja,graced with full-blown red and white lotuses and varioustrees. Observe again, O son of Sumitra, the picturesquewood-land around the lake, where trees, crowned with largebranches resembling the summits of a mountain, appear likeso many hills. Mental agony arising from Sitā'sravishment and Bharata's grief, have been grinding me who amalready stricken with sorrrow. Verily conduceth to myfelicity the pleasant lake Pampā of cool water, scattered withvarious flowers, covered with lotuses, highly graceful, girt withvariegated woods abounding in voracious animals andfrequented by deer and birds. This green common, chequeredwith yellow and blue, appeareth of enhanced beauty by thevarious flowers of the trees as if covered with a blanket ofdiverse hues. The tops of the trees rich with flowery bunchesare gnarled with creepers of blossoming tips. Now hathappeared, O Saumitri, the fragrant spring of pleasant breezes,when greatly prevaileth the influence of Cupid and the treesare graced with fruits and flowers. Behold, O Saumitri, thebeauty of the woods, showering flowers like unto cloudspouring forth rain. Various trees growing on rocky surfaces,moved by the wind have been scattering flowers on theearth. Behold, O Saumitri, the wind is sporting as it werewith flowers dropt, dropping and hanging on the trees. Thebees, driven off and singing, pursue the wind, moving theflowery branches of the trees. While issuing out of themountainous hollows the wind is singing as it were andmaking the trees dance with the musical notes of the delightedcuckoos. The wind, making the tops of the trees collidewith each other, is as it were stringing them together. Thesandal-cool wind, of pleasant touch, ever removing theexhaustion of toil, is blowing everywhere carrying with it purefragrance. The trees in this nectar-smelling forest aresounding as it were with the hum of bees. Hillocks overtopped withpicturesque and flowery trees stand beautifully on thismountainous expanse. Trees with flowery tops, tossed bythe airy currents and crested with the bees, are as if dancingin accompaniment with melodious strains. Behold, theKarnikaras covered with flowers appear on all sides like untohuman beings decorated with golden ornaments and wearingyellow cloths. This spring, O Saumitri, sounded by themusical notes of the birds hath been kindling my grief whoam without Sitā. Cupid hath been smiting me the morewho am stricken with grief, and the cuckoos have been defyingme, displaying their mirth, O Lakshmana. At the pleasantfountains the delighted Dātyuahas with their warblings havebeen afflicting me who am possessed by Cupid. Formerlymy dear one, while in the asylum, delighted with the music ofthese birds, used to attain to a greater joy addressing me tohear them. Behold, birds of variegated hues, emitting forthdiverse notes have been alighting upon the trees, grovesand creepers from various quarters. O Saumitri, birds andbees of melodious notes accompanied by their co-mates anddelighted with their mutual companionship are on the banksof this lake. There live happily flocks of delighted vultures.The trees sounded by the lascivious murmurs of Datyuhasand Punskokilas have been kindling my amour. The fire ofspring having clusters of Asokas as its embers, the humof bees as its sound, the redness of the twigs as itsflame, hath been burning me. O Saumitri, of what availis this life unto me, not beholding Sitā of sweet accents,having eyes with their eye-lashes, and a head of curly hair.O blameless one, this season, when the groves becomecharming and the border-lands resound with melodiousstrains of the cuckoos, is the most beloved of mydear one. Methinks, this fire of distress, originating fromamorous trouble and enhanced by the influence of spring,shall soon burn me down. My amorous feelings shall attainto an intense height, as I do not behold Sitā before, whereassee the beautiful trees around. Sitā, away from my visionand the spring, drying up perspiration, have been both incitingmy amour. That one having the eyes of a fawn and ruthlessvernal breeze, O Saumitri, have been oppressing me who amoverpowered with anxiety and grief. These peacocks andpea-hens unfurling their wings like unto crystal lattices,have been dancing hither and thither. These maddenedpeacocks encircled by the pea-hens, have been aggravatingmy amorous desire who am already possessed by theCupid. Observe, O Lakshmana, there danceth with herdancing mate on the mountainous expanse, the pea-hen,troubled with amorous sentiments. The peacock unfoldinghis charming wings is moving after his dear mate mockingme as it were with his cry. Surely the Rākshasa hath notbrought my dear one in this forest of peacocks and thereforethey dance with their mates in this picturesque forest land.It is unbearable for me to live without Sitā in this season offlowers. Behold, O Lakshmana, this attachment is to be seeneven amongst the brutes. The pea-hen being influenced bypassion is approaching her mate. Sitā of expansive eyeswould have thus neared me being influenced by amour hadshe not been carried away. In this season of springflowers of this forest are of no avail to me. These pleasantflowers of the trees have been uselessly falling on theearth with the bees. The birds exciting my desire havebeen delightedly warbling in flocks as if welcoming eachother. Surely Sitā, under the influence of another person,is lamenting in the same strain, as I do, if spring hathappeared there. Even if spring hath not appeared therehow can Sitā having eyes resembling full-blown lotuseslive in my separation? If spring is there, what can it do herhaving a beautiful hip and loins, who hath already beenoverpowered by a mighty enemy? Surely shall my dear wifeof a slender make, having eyes like lotus-petals and of sweetaccents renounce her life at the appearance of this spring?Methinks, for certain, the chaste Sitā shall not be able tomaintain her being at my separation. Vaidehi's attachmentis entirely centred in me and mine in her. This cool breezeof a pleasant touch, carrying the fragrance of flowers appearslike a fire-brand unto me who am thinking of my spouse.That breeze appeareth painful unto me in Sitā's absencewhich, ere this, had been regarded by me as a source of pleasurein her company. This bird set up a cry in the sky at thattime107 and now sitting on the tree is crying delightedly. Thisbird flying up in the sky brought about Sitā's ravishmentand this bird shall take me to her having expansive eyes.Hear, O Lakshmana, the maddening notes of those birdssitting on the tops of the flowery trees and setting up theirmelody. The Vramaras are approaching the Tilakas tossedby the wind like unto intoxicated damsels. This Asoka,enhancing the desires of the amorous, stands here, as ifremonstrating with me by its clusters shaken by the wind.There appear, O Lakshmana, those blossoming mangoe treeslike unto persons, exercised with passion and smeared withunguents of sandal. Behold, O Saumitri, O foremost of men,the kinnaras are ranging at large in this varieagatedforestland on the banks of Pampā. Here the fragrant red lotusesare shedding forth their splendour like unto the newly risensun. Here appeareth beautifully the lake Pampā oftransparent water, filled with blue and fragrant lotuses, swans andKarandhabas and abounding in red lotuses like unto thevirgin rays of the sun and having their filaments crushed bythe bees. And the beautiful woods around the lake have beenmanifesting their beauty, filled with chakrabakas and the herdsof elephants and deer desirous of drinking water. Behold,Lakshmana, the picturesque view of the lotuses oscillatedby the ripples driven to and fro by the wind. I do notdelight in my life, not beholding Sitā, having expansive eyeslike unto lotus-petals and ever fond of lotuses. O how wily isthe course of Kāma who hath been presenting unto my mindthat auspicious one, hard to attain and of sweet-accents! HadI not been overpowered by this season of spring withblossoming trees, I would have been able to put up withthe present amorous infliction. The objects which appearedbeautiful unto me while in the company of Sitā, now seemshorn of all grace in her separation. My eyes pant forbeholding those lotus-petals, O Lakshmana, because of theirresemblance with Sitā's eyes. Issuing out of the trees andtouching the filaments, the pleasant wind is blowing like untoSitā's breath. Behold O Lakshmana, the flowery branchesof the Karnikaras on the summits of the mountain situatedon the southern bank of Pampā. This prince of mountains,beautified with various metals, hath been throwing updusts of diverse colors driven by the wind. O Saumitri,these mountainous expanses are burning in beauty withblossoming and beautiful Kinsukas void of leaves. These fragrantMalatis, Mallikas, Karavis and lotuses, growing on thebanks of Pampā, and fostered by Pampā's water, and Ketakis,Sindhubaras, Basantis, Matulingas, Purnas, Kunda groves,Chiribilyas, Madukas, Banjulas, Vakulas, Champakas,Tilakas, Nāgas, Padmyakas, blue Asokas, Ankolas, Kurantas,Churnakas, Paribhadrakas, and yellow Lodhras on thehills like unto manes of a lion, are in flowers. Thereappear beautifully on the hills, blossoming Chutas, Patalas,Kobidaras, Muchukundas, Arjunas, Ketakas, Uddalakas,Sirisas, Singsapas, Dhabas, Salmalis, Kingsukas, Raktas,Kuravas, Tinisas, Naktamalas, sandal trees, Syandanas,Hintalas, Tilakas and Nāgas. Behold, O Saumitri, manya beautiful and blossoming tree growing on the banks ofPampā and gnarled by creepers having flowery tips. Likeunto inebriate damsels, these creepers are embracing thetrees, hard by, having their branches tossed by the wind.The breeze, delighted with various tastes is passing fromtree to tree, mountain to mountain and forest to forest.Some fragrant trees, covered with flowers and some withbuds, appear beautifully green. Saying, 'this is sweet', 'this ispleasant' and 'this is full-blown,' the attached bees are fallingto the trees. And rising again they are approaching theother trees growing on the banks of Pampā. Thisforestland, strewn with flowers dropping spontaneously fromthe trees like unto a bed sheet, hath become pleasant. OSaumitri, the mountainous levels variegated with flowers, areappearing like unto beds. Behold O Saumitri, theorigination of flowers in the trees at the expiry of the winter. Thetrees as if vieing with each other, have blossomed in thisseason of flowers. The trees, O Lakshmana, with beeshumming around and with flowery branches are as ifwelcoming each other. This swan, hath been sporting with itsmate in the lucid water of Pampā exciting my amour. Trulydoes this lake like unto Mandākini itself, deserve theaccomplishments that are known all over the world. O best ofRaghus, I do not desire Ayodhya or the dignity of Indra ifthat chaste Sitā, be found here and if I can live with her. I shallrenounce all desires and thoughts if I can sport with her inthis picturesque and green forest-land. These trees, clothedin diverse flowery attires, have been exciting my thoughtin this forest, who have been deprived of my dear one. OSaumitri, behold this Pampā of cool water, enveloped on allsides with lotuses, and frequented by Chakrabakas,Karandavas, Chraunchas, Plabas and high deer. Its beauty hathbeen further enhanced by the birds caroling. Diversedelighted birds have been exciting my passion, reminding me ofmy dear spouse, of blameless countenance, having amoonlike face and eyes resembling lotus-petals. Behold on theyonder mountainous expanse of various colors, stagssporting with hinds and myself on the other hand forsaken byVaidehi having eyes resembling those of an antelope. Thesedeer ranging hither and thither have been distressing mysoul. It is then only that I shall attain to mental quietitudeif I can behold Sitā on this charming mountainous expansefilled with birds and deer. It is then that I shall draw myvital breath, O Saumitri, if Vaidehi, of slender waist, with me,enjoyeth the fine breeze of Pampā dispersing the fragranceof lotuses and Saugandhikas and ever assuaging grief.Blessed are they, O Lakshraana who enjoy this wild breeze ofPampā. How hath that exquisitely fine daughter of Janaka,my beloved spouse, having eyes resembling lotus-petals,brought under the control of another person, been livingforsaken by me? What shall I speak unto that virtuous,truthful king Janaka when he shall interrogate me aboutSitā's welfare in an assembly? Where is that Sitā nowwho followed me in the track of virtue, who amunfortunate and have been exiled unto woods by my Sire? Howshall I keep up (my being) being poorly, O Lakshmana, beingforsaken by that Sitā who followed me, deprived ofkingdom and sense? My heart is sinking not beholding herfine spotless countenance, having eyes resembling lotusesand smelling sweet. When shall I hear again OLakshmana, the sweet incomparable and auspicious accents ofVaidehi, intervened by smiles and couched in an elegantand easy style? That chaste and exquisitely fine damseleven when afflicted in the woods used to welcome meunder the influence of Cupid as if she were delightedand had her sorrows removed. O son of a king, whatshall I speak unto Kauçalya in Ayodhya when she willask mc of her high-souled daughter-in-law's welfare andwhereabouts? Do thou proceed, O Lakshmana, and joinBharata gifted with fraternal affection. I am incapableof living any more without that daughter of Janaka.\"Thereupon Lakshmana addressed unto the high-souled Rāmawho was thus bewailing like one helpless with thefollowing pregnant and immutable words. \"Forsake thygrief, O Rāma. May good betide thee. Do not grieve O bestof men. Even the sinless persons lose their seuse when theyare afflicted with grief. Remembering the grief consequent onseparation do thou forsake thy attachment unto thy dear one.Out of an excess of oil even the wick burneth itself. Oworshipful one, even if he hideth himself in the region under theearth or in a darker quarter, Rāvana shall not be able to drawhis breath. Do thou procure information about thatvicious-souled Rākshasa; either he shall give up Sitā or meet withdestruction. Unless he gives back Sitā, forsooth I shall kill himeven if he enters with her into Diti's womb. Do thou, consolethyself and renounce thy poorliness of mind, O worshipfulone. Without sufficient endeavours even men of energy donot regain their lost ends. O worshipful one mighty is thecourse of energy. And than this there is no greater poweron earth. And there is nothing unattainable in this world toone gifted with energy. Persons endowed with zeal do neverwear away in their actions. And resorting to this energyonly that we shall regain Jānaki. Do thou not percieve thatthou art high-souled and highly educated? And leavingbehind grief do thou forsake thy amorous madness.\" Beingthus accosted by Lakshmana, Rāma having his mind strickenwith sorrow, attained to mental quietitude renouncinggrief and dolour. Thereupon Rāma, of unimaginable prowess,passed slowly by the pleasant and charming Pampā withbanks girt with trees shaken by the wind."

Beholding their countenances passing strange, thatmighty chief, of monkeys, while ranging near the mountRishyamuka, became highly terrified and motionless.Observing them range there, that high-souled monkey, wendingslowly like unto an elephant and stricken with fear andgrief, became exceedingly sorry. Espying the highlypowerful Rāma and Lakshmana there, monkeys, terrified, enteredinto that holy and pleasant asylum, a worthy refuge andhaving its inside always frequented by them."

That best of monkeys, of adisturbed mind, cast his looks around and could not stand(patiently) at any place. Beholding those two of great prowesshe could not make up his mind to remain there and the heartof that terrified monkey, sank. Pondering over whatis more and what is less important the virtuous-souledSugriva became highly anxious along with that monkey-herd.Beholding Rāma and Lakshmana, Sugriva, the king ofmonkeys, greatly exercised with anxiety spake unto hiscounsellors, saying—\"Forsooth, these two heroes, in falseguises and wearing bark, despatched by Vāli, have come heretraversing the forest stronghold.\" Beholding these twomighty archers the counsellors of Sugriva, quitting thatmountainous expanse proceeded to another best of hills.Thereupon proceeding quickly the commanders of variousmonkey herds stood encircling the king of monkeys and thechief of leaders. The monkeys thus sharing in the misery andhappiness (of their chief) proceeded jumping from hill to hillshaking the summits thereof, with the velocity (of theirpersons). Thereupon those mighty monkeys, jumping, broke downthe flowery trees of that stronghold. Those best of monkeys,springing all around that mighty hill, proceeded terrifyingthe deer, the wild cats and the tigers. Stationed on thatbest of mountains the ministers of Sugriva, coming in thefront of that monkey-chief, stood with clapped palms.Thereupon Hanumān, skilled in speech, spake unto Sugriva, terrifiedand afraid of Vāli's wicked wiles, saying:—\"Let all themonkeys renounce Vāli's fear; in this best of mountains,Malaya—there is no fear of him. I do not behold, O best ofmonkeys, that wicked Vāli of terrible looks, afraid of whomthou hast fled away and for whom thou art anxious. I do notobserve here, O gentle one, the wicked-souled Vāli, thy elderbrother of impious actions and whom thou dost fear andI do not percieve any terror proceeding from him. Omonkey-chief, truly manifest is thy monkey-hood and it is throughthy light-heartedness that thou art incapable of fixing thysoul. Gifted with intellect and knowledge do thou performall by means of gestures. A king void of sense cannotgovern all creatures.\" Hearing those pregnant words ofHanumān,Sugriva said in better accents—\"Who is not terifiedbeholding those two mighty armed heroes, having expansiveeyes, with bows, arrow, and daggers in their hands like untotwo sons of a celestial? Methinks these two best of menhave been despatched by Vāli. Kings have many friends.And it is not proper for me to place confidence in them.People should know that enemies, always treacherous bynature, range under false guises. And those foes, availingof their credulity, bring about their destruction wheneveropportunity presents itself. Vāli is eminently expert indespatching business. Monarchs, cognizant of many a wilyexpedient, bring about others' destruction. It is proper todiscern them by means of disguised spies. O monkey, dothou proceed under a false guise and come by their intentions,examining them aright by their countenances, gestures andwords. Do thou ascertain their intention. If dost thou find themdelighted, secure their confidence in my favour, by eulogizingme again and again and giving out unto them my views. Obest of monkeys,do thou ask them why they have entered thisforest, if thou dost perceive that these two archers arepure-souled. Do thou determine the fairness and unfairness oftheir purpose by means of their gestures and conversation.\"Being commanded by that chief of monkeys, the son ofMaruta purposed to approach Rāma and Lakshmana.Assenting to the words of the terrified and unconquerable Sugrivaand saying 'Be it so,' Hanumān, the high-souled monkeyproceeded where the heroic Rāma was with Lakshmana."

Thereupon renouncinghis monkey shape, the son of Maruta, not confidihg in them,assumed the semblance of a mendicant. Approaching themhumbly, Hanumān paid obeisance unto them. And heeulogized them truly in words, sweet and pleasant. Greetingduly those two heroes, having truth for their prowess, thatbest of monkeys addressed them in sweet accents inconsonance with Sugriva's instructions. \"Ye are ascetics ofcelebrated austerities, resembling the Rajarshis and celestialsand best of Brahmacharis, why have ye come here causingfear unto these deer and other wild animals of the forest?Surveying around the trees grown on the banks of Pampā,ye have enhanced the beauty of this lake of auspicious water.Who are ye two youthful figures of mighty arms, wearingbark, patient, sighing and troubling these wild animals?Heroic, of leonine looks, gifted with mighty strength andprowess, slayers of foes, and holding a bow like unto that ofSakra; graceful, of a pleasant countenance, of prowess likeunto a mighty bull, having hands resembling the trunks ofelephants, effulgent, great among men, youthful, beautifyingthis chief of mountains with the effulgence of your persons,worthy of having kingdoms, and like unto celestials, whyhave ye come here?

Methinks ye two are perfectly able to protectthis entire earth, filled with forests and oceans, and intersectedby the mountains Vindhya and Meru. These thy paintedand smooth bows appear like unto the thunder-bolts of Indraadorned with gold. And these beautiful quivers are filled tothe brim with sharpened and deadly shafts like unto flamingfire and serpents. And these two daggers, of mightyproportions, furnished with burning gold, appear like unto serpents, letloose. Why do ye not answer me accosting you thus?

And know me to be hiscounsellor—a monkey, the son of Pavana, ranging everywhere at my will, coming here, under the guise of a mendicant,from the mount Rishymuka, for the welfare of Sugriva.\"Having addressed thus those two heroes—Rāma andLakshmana, Hanumān, conversant with words and skilled inspeech, did not speak again.

Do thou welcome, with pleasant words, O Saumitri,this monkey—Sugriva's minister, the subduer of foes,affectionate and skilled in speech. None can speak thus whohath not mastered the Rig-veda, borne well the Yajur-vedaand acquainted himself thoroughly with the Shyam-veda.Forsooth he hath studied well all the Grammars, for he hathnot used a single inelegant word though he hath addressedme with a number of them. And no defect was perceived onhis countenance, eyes, forehead, brows or on any of his limbs.His words,—few, beyond all suspicion, pleasant, and utteredin a mild tone,—came out readily of his throat and breast. Hehas uttered accents, wonderful, ready, accomplished,auspicious and captivating. Whose heart is not moved by thesewonderful words, proceeding from heart, throat and brain)?Even an enemy, who hath his sword uplifted, (is moved).O sinless one, how doth that monarch accomplish his objectswho hath not got such a messenger? Indeed whoseemissaries are so accomplished, all his missions are fulfilled onlyby virtue of their words.\" Thus addressed, Saumitri, skilledin speech, welcomed that monkey—Sugriva's counsellor andson of Pavana. 'O learned one! We knew well theaccomplishments of the high-souled Sugriva. We shallfind out that king of monkey herds. O Hanumān, O best ofmonkeys, we shall go by whatever thou shalt say, under theinstructions of Sugriva.\" Hearing these skillful words, thatson of Pavana, delighted, revolving within him the means forSugriva's conquest, purposed to bring about a friendly unionbetween them."

I amthe younger brother of this one endeued with gratitude andof various lore. Subdued by his virtues, I, Lakshmana byname, have dedicated myself to his service. Worthy ofhappiness, homage, and intent upon the welfare of all beings,deprived of wealth and living in the forest, he hath his wifecarried off by a Rākshasa, wearing shapes at will. Nor havewe yet (been able) to ascertain who is that Rākshasa that hathcarried off his wife. A son of Diti named Danu, had, by virtueof an imprecation, undergone Rākshasa-hood. He it iswho had related unto us all about the capable Sugriva.—\"That exceedingly puissant one shall have a knowledge ofthe ravisher of thy wife.\" Having said this, Danu beaming(with a halo) went to heaven. Thus have I related unto theeall as it fell out. Both Rāma and myself have saught theshelter of Sugriva. Having given away profuse wealth andattained high fame, this one who formerly was the lord ofthe worlds, now wishes to make Sugriva his master. Thatone attached unto virtue, that refuge (of all)—the son ofthat shelter (of all beings) hath come under the protection ofSugriva. That spiritual guide, who ere now was worthyof being the shelter (of all) and who (actually) was the refuge(of all creatures)—Rāghava, hath saught the shelter ofSugriva. That Rāma in whose happiness and favor thesubjects found their felicity, seeketh the good graces ofSugriva. Famed over the three worlds, the eldest son ofthat monarch who had always and for aye honored all thekings of the earth crowned with every virtue,—viz. Rāma,hath sought the protection of Sugriva, lord of monkeys. OnRāma being overwhelmed with sorrow, tried by grief, andhaving come under his refuge, it behoveth Sugriva alongwith the leaders of bands to show favor unto Rāma.\" WhenSumatra's son shedding tears had spoken thus, that oneskilled in speech, Hanumān, answered in these words,'Persons of such a stamp, endeued with understanding, ofcontrolled anger and subdued senses, should be seen by themaster of monkeys; and such come within one's ken throughblessed luck. He also hath been driven out of his kingdom,and hath incurred the hostility of Vāli. And his wife tornaway from him, he dwelleth in this wood, in fear, having beenexceedingly harassed by his brother. That son of the Sun,Sugriva, along with us, will help thee in seeking out Sitā.Having said these sweet and hurried words, Hanumān saidunto Rāghava, 'I will (now) repair unto Sugriva.' WhenHanumān had said this, the righteous Lakshmana duly payinghomage unto the former, addressed Rāghava, saying, 'Fromthe glad way in which this son of the god of the wind isspeaking, it appears that he also seeks thy service; and, arriving(at this region) thou also, Rāghava, hast reaped success. Hespeaketh openly with a delightful light in his countenance;and cheerfulness. (It seems) that the heroic Hanumān, sonunto the God of wind doth not speak anything that is false.'Then that vastly wise one Hanumān the son of the wind goddeparted, taking with him the heroic descendants of Raghu,for (presenting them) unto the monarch of monkeys.Renouncing the guise of a beggar, and assuming the formof a monkey, that foremost of monkeys went away, placingthose heroes on his back. And then the heroic monkey,the son of the wind-god, of wide fame, and great prowess,with his mind perfectly pure, considering himself as crownedwith success, and experiencing exceeding delight, arrivedat that best of mountains in company with Rāma andLakshmana."

This is Rāma having truth for hisprowess, in company with his brother, Lakshmana. Rāmathe son of Daçaratha, is born in the race of the Ikshwākus.Ever doing the will of his sire, he has been sent hither, inorder that his father's verity may stand in tact. Rāma, whohath come to the forest, is the son of him who hathpropitiated Fire with Rājasuyas and horse sacrifices,—dispensingDakshinas and kine by hundreds and thousands—and whohath governed the earth by asceticism and truthful speech.His son Rāma hath come to the forest through a woman.While that high-souled one having his senses under controlwas dwelling in the woods, his wife was carried off byRāvana; and he (Rāma) hath (in consequence) sought thyprotection. Do thou, granting an interview unto the brothersRāma and Lakshmana—both of them worthy of homage—who are eager for thy friendship, receive them respectfully.\"Hearing Hanumān's words, Sugriva—lord of monkeys,becoming visible (at his will), gladly spake unto Rāghava,\"Sir, you are versed in morality, and bear love towards all.The son of the wind-god hath faithfully described yourvirtues unto me. That you, O lord, are anxious to contractfriendship with me who am a monkey does me honor andis my gain. If you relish friendship with me, do you takethis stretched arm and my hand with yours,—and bindyourself fast with a vow.\" Hearing these sweet words ofSugriva, (Rāma) exceedingly delighted, pressed Sugriva'shand with his. And contracting friendship with Sugriva,Rāma experiencing great joy embraced him warmly. Thenthat subduer of foes, Hanumān, leaving off the guise of abeggar, in his native shape produced a fire with two piecesof wood. Then worshipping that flaming fire with flowers,he, well pleased, carefully placed it between them (Rāma andSugriva.) Then Sugriva and Rāghava went round the fire;and (thus) they were fastened in friendship. And withdelighted hearts, both of them—the monkey and Rāghavabegan to gaze at each other, yet they did not feel satiated.\"Thou art the friend of my heart. Our happiness and miseryare common,\"—Sugriva, rejoicing greatly, said these wordsunto Rāghava. Then spreading a beautifully blossomingspray of Sāla, full of foliage, Sugriva made an awning and satdown with Rāghava. Hanumān, the son of the wind-godwith great joy gave unto Lakshmana a bough of a sandaltree, plentifully blossoming. Next Sugriva, feeling highrapture, with his eyes expanded with joy, answeredRāma blandly in sweet words, saying, \"Oppressed have Ibeen, O Rāma; and here am always afflicted with fear.Deprived of my wife, I have, agitated with apprehension,sought refuge in this dense wilderness. I am afflicted withfright, and worried by fear, with my senses bewildered inthis wood. Wronged have I been by Vāli, my brother; and Ihave incurred his hostility, O Rāghava. And, O exalted one,do thou dispell the fear of me, who am tormented withfear on account of Vāli. And, O Kākutstha, it behoves theeso to act that I may not become subject to fear.\" Thusaddressed, the powerful Kākutstha, knowing righteousness,and devoted to virtue, answered Sugriva, smiling, \"O mightymonkey, that the outcome of amity is good offices I am wellaware of. I will slay that captor of thy wife Vāli. Theseinfallible sharpened shafts of mine, resembling the sun,feathered with the plumes of the Kanka, like unto thethunderbolt of the great Indra, having sharp heads and even knots,like infuriated serpents,—being let go with vehemence,shall alight upon the impious Vāli. Do thou today beholdVāli slain with sharpened shafts, resembling venomoussnakes,—like unto a torn hill lying on the ground.\" Hearingthose words of Rāghava fraught with his welfare, Sugrivasupremely rejoiced, said these words, informed with rapture,\"Thou hero! Thou lion among men! by thy grace shall Iobtain both my beloved and my monarchy. O God amongmen, do thou so deal with that foe, my elder brother, thathe may not again wrong me.\" The left eyes of Sitā, thelord of apes, and night rangers,—respectively like the lotus,gold, and flaming fire, throbbed when the friendship betweenRāma and Sugriva was contracted."

Thy wife, Maithili, daughterunto Janaka, separated from thee as well as the intelligentLakshmana, and weeping (in consequence) was carried off bya Rāksha. Seeing for opportunities of doing mischief thatRāksha, having slain Jatāyu, hath caused unto thee thegrief that comes of separation from one's wife. But thouwilt soon be relieved from the sorrow that comes ofseparation from one's wife. Her will I bring like unto the ravishedDevaçruti. O repressor of foes, whether she be in thenether regions or under the sky, I will, bringing thy wife, makeher over unto thee. O Rāghava, know my words to be true.O mighty-armed one, like unto poison, thy wife is incapableof being digested even by the gods and Asuras with Indra(at their head). O mighty-armed one, leave off sorrow, Iwill bring back thy beloved. From guess I find that it wasdoubtless Mithilā's daughter whom I saw when she wasbeing carried away by that Rāksha of terrific deeds. Shewas crying, 'Rāma, Rāma, Lakshmana, Lakshmana,' and inthe lap of Rāvana she looked like the wife of the Snake-chief.Seeing me along with my four counsellors stationed at thehill, she dropped down her scarf and her ornaments. Allthese, O Rāghava, I have taken and kept (with me). I willbring them. It behoveth thee to recognise them.\"Thereupon Rāma spoke unto the sweet-speeched Sugriva, 'Bring(them), at once, my friend. Why dost thou tarry?' Havingbeen thus addressed, Sugriva swiftly entered a deep cavernin the mountain, with the view of doing what was dear untoRāghava. Then taking the scarf as well as the ornaments.\"Look at this,\" (Saying this) the monkey held them beforeRāma. And taking the sheet and the ornaments, (Rāma)had his eyes filled with tears, like the moon covered by thedew. And from affection for Sitā, (Rāma,) his eyes filledwith tears, deprived of patience, fell down to the ground.And placing the elegant ornaments on his bosom, he sighedagain and again, like an enraged serpent in a hole. Andseeing Sumitra's son at his side, Rāma shedding ceaselesstears, began to lament piteously, \"O Lakshmana, behold thisscarf and these ornaments which Vaidehi, while being carriedaway, let fall from her person to the earth. Surely Sitā,while being ravished, let these fall on a sward, for theseremain as before.\" Thus accosted, Lakshmana spoke, saying,\"I do not know her bracelets; I do not know her ear-rings.But I know full well her bangles on account of my alwaysbowing down unto her feet.\" Thereupon Rāghava said thesewords unto Sugriva, \"Tell me, O Sugriva, at what place didstthou see Sitā, while she, dear unto me as life, was taken awayby the fierce-looking Rākshasa? And where doth thatRāksha, who hath brought on this high peril, and for whomI will slay all the Rākshasas, live? He, that hath carried offMithilā's daughter, and roused my wrath, hath certainly forhis own end, opened the door of death. Tell me all aboutthat ranger of the night, that deceitfully hath carried away mydearest wife from the forest. My foe, O lord of monkey,will I to-day send to the neighbourhood of Yama.\""

O vanquisher of foes, leave offsorrowing. I promise unto thee truly, I will exert so that thoumayst obtain Maithili.

Do not beoverwhelmed with grief: summon the fortitude that is inthee. Such lightness of sense doth not become persons likethee.

A despicable monkey as Iam, I do not grieve for her,—and what again shall I say ofone that is magnanimous, endued with meekness andfirmness, and great? It behoveth thee to restrain thy fallingtears by patience. It behoveth thee not to resign thatpatience which is the dignity of persons possessed of thequality of goodness.

Atthe death of our father, the counsellors, saying,—'This is theeldest son', made him, who was well loved (of all), lord of themonkeys in the kingdom. While he was governing thekingdom which had belonged to his father and grand-father,I, at all times, in humiliation, remained like a servant. Therewas one endued with energy, named Māyāvi. He was theeldest son of Dunduvi. Formerly there arose a mightyhostility between himself and Vāli. And it came to passthat one night when all had fallen asleep, (Māyāvi) comingto Kishkindhā, began to emit roars in great wrath, andchallenged Vāli to an encounter. My brother, who was fastasleep, hearing those dreadful yells, could not bear them;but at once rushed out vehemently. And as he rushed out inwrath, for the purpose of slaying that foremost of Asuras, hewas opposed by his wives as well as myself, who humbledhimself before him. But moving them aside, thatexceedingly powerful one sallied out. Thereupon out of affection Ialso went out with Vāli. And seeing my brorher and mepresent from a distance, the Asura, seized with a panic,fled with speed. And as he was rushing on in fear and whenwe had proceeded further, the moon arising, discovered theway. And the Asura, coming by a capacious and impregnablehole covered with grass (on the surface), entered it amain;and we remained there. Seeing his enemy enter the hole,Vāli, overcome by anger, and with his senses agitated, spokeunto me, saying, \"Do thou, O Sugriva, carefully stay at themouth of the hole, while I entering in, slay my foe in battle.\"Hearing his speech, that subduer of foes was besought byme (for permission to enter the cave along with him). Butmaking me swear by touching his feet he entered thecave. And after he had entered the cave, and as Iremained at its mouth, a space of over a complete yearrolled away. And seized with sorrow (I reflected), 'AsI do not see my brother, he must be lost'—and my mindwas alarmed, apprehending his death. After a long time,I saw frothy blood issuing from the cave. Thereat I wasgreatly aggrieved. And roars of Asuras also reachedmy ears; but I could not hear the cries of my superior,engaged in conflict. And from these signs concluding mybrother to be slain, I, closing the mouth of the cavern witha crag, huge as a hill, and afflicted with grief, afterperforming his watery rites, came (back) to Kishkindhi, O my friend.And although I carefully concealed (the matter), thecounselors heard it all. There they, assembled together, installedme (in the kingdom). And, as I was ruling the kingdomwith justice, it came to pass that after having slain his foe,the Dānava, that monkey (Vāli) came to Kishkindhā. Thenseeing me installed, he, with his eyes reddened in wrath,slaying my counsellors, spoke harsh words to me. Andalthough I was capable of chastising him, yet my mindinfluenced by a sense of my brother's dignity, did not inclinetowards that sin. Having slain his foe, he then entered hiscity; and I, honoring that high-souled one, duly saluted him.He withal did not with a glad heart utter his benediction.And, O lord, I, bowing, touched his feet with my crown; yetfrom anger Vāli did not extend to me his grace.\""

That mighty wise one, skilled in warfare, is capableof fighting with thee on equal terms like unto Namuchi withVasava. Do thou speedily repair unto him if dost thou wishfor a conflict. He is always expert in military exploits andis hard to repress.\" Hearing Himavān's words, Dundhuvi,inflamed with ire, went to Kishkindhā—Vāli's capital.Assuming the figure of a terrible buffaloe, with sharpenedhorns like unto a cloud big with water, ranging on the skyin the rainy season, and approaching the gate of Kishkindhāthat highly powerful one set up a terrible roar, shakiagthe earth like unto the sound of a kettle-drum. Like ontoan elephant he felled, out of haughtiness, the trees around,and rent the earth with his hoofs scraping it with hishorns. Vāli was in the female-apartment at that time, andunable to bear the sound came out with his wives like ontothe Moon with stars. Thereupon that lord of monkeys andother wild animals, spoke openly unto Dundhuvi, saying,\"O Dundhuvi, obstructing this my city-gate, why dost thouset up a terrible roar? Dost thou know my mighty strength?Do thou save thy own life.\" Hearing those words of thatintelligent lord of monkeys, Dundhuvi, with reddened eyesspoke:—\"O hero, it becometh thee not to speak thus beforethy wives. Do thou enter into conflict with me and thy prowessshall be ascertained thereafter. Or I shall suppress mywrath for this night and do thou, O monkey, enjoy till therise of the Sun. Embracing all the monkeys, inviting all thyfriends, do thou, that art the lord of the monkey herds,honor them with gifts. Do thou survey Kiskindhā and makethy children kings. And do thou enjoy with thy wives—itis me that shall crush down thy pride. He, who destroyetha person who is given up to drinking, reckless, emaciated anddeprived of weapons, and one like thee, sunk in the abyssof voluptuousness, committeth the sin consequent upon thedestruction of an embryo,\" Whereto replied Vāli, laughing,unto that wicked lord of Asuras, leaving aside all hiswives, headed by Tāra. \"If thou art not afraid of fighting,do not consider me as one given up to drinking only.Do thou regard this my attachment as a draught in thisconflict, to be drunk by the heroes.\" Saying this, Vāli,taking his golden garland, conferred on him by his fatherMahendra, addressed himself for the conflict. Holding himby the horns, Vāli, that lord of monkeys, setting up aterrible roar, hurled Dundhuvi resembling a mountain.And bellowing a thundering voice, Vāli crushed (him) down.And blood began to trickle down from the pores of his ears.Both of them desired to subdue each other—and thusthere arose a terrible conflict between Vāli and Dundhuvi.Thereupon fought Vāli equalling Sakra in prowess, by fistsknees, legs, stones and trees. And thus there was a skirmishbetween the monkey chief and the Asura. And in thisconflict Asura's strength was greatly reduced, while that ofSakra's son was highly enhanced. Holding up Dundhuvihe threw him on the ground. And in that dreadful skirmishDundhuvi was greatly reduced. And there was a profusionof blood falling from the ears of that one crushed down.Thereupon that one of mighty arms fell down to the earthand breathed his last. And taking up with his arms thatlifeless one, the mighty Vāli hurled him with great force atdistance of a yojana. While thus thrown down by force,drops of blood, falling from his mouth, driven by the wind,fell upon the asylum of the great Saint Matanga. O greatone, beholding the drops of blood there, the great ascetic,angered, thought within himself—\"Who might be the authorof this sprinkling of blood? Who is that wicked-souled,vicious-minded, stupid person, who hath all on a suddensprinkled me with blood?\" Saying this, that best of saintsissued out (of the hermitage) and surveyed a lifeless buffalolying on the earth, like unto a huge mountain. Andapprehending by virtue of his asceticism that this hath been committed bya monkey, he imprecated a mighty curse on the perpetrator(of that iniquitous deed).—\"He shall not enter here who hathspoiled the sanctity of my forest with showers of blood.And surely he shall be killed (on entering). Forsooth shallthat wicked one cease to exist if he strideth within a yojanaaround my asylum, who hath felled these trees by throwingthe body of the Asura. His counsellors or any one relatedto him, who shall resort to this my forest (shall meet withthe self-same fate). They shall not live here; hearing thisfrom me let them take their own ways. And even if theylive here, forsooth, shall I curse them too. This my forestis being protected by me every day like unto my own son—and the monkeys are always used to destroy its leaves, treesand roots. Forgive them I to-day—but if I find anytomorrow, he shall be turned into stone for many thousandyears.\" Hearing those words of the saint, the monkey herdissued out (of the forest). And beholding them (comingout of the forest) Vāli spoke—\"Why have ye all—the dwellersof the Matanga forest approached me—Is it all well withyou?\" Thereupon they related unto Vāli, wearing a goldengarland, the cause of the Saint's curse by him and othermonkeys. Hearing those words, Vāli approached that greatascetic and solicited him with folded hands. Disregardinghim, the ascetic entered into his asylum and Vāli wasoverwhelmed with the fear of curse. O Lord of men, afraid ofthe curse that monkey chief purposed to repair unto themount Rishyamuka. Knowing for certain, O Rāma, thathe shall not enter this forest, I have been living herewith my ministers, devoid of fear and grief. Here isthe collection of Dundhuvi's bones, killed on account ofhis own haughtiness, resembling a huge mountain. Theseare the seven huge Sala trees, clothed in branches, whichVāli could simultaneously divest of leaves by virtue of hisprowess. I have related unto thee, O Rāma, the incomparableprowess of his. Do thou tell me now, O hero, how canst thoudestroy him in the conflict?\" Unto Sugriva speaking thus,Lakshmana smiling replied:—\"Performing what, shalt thouconfide in (Rāma's ability) to destroy Vāli?\" ThereuponSugriva bespake him—\" These seven Sala trees, before thee,the mighty Vāli, formerly pierced, all at a time, with oneshaft. If Rāma can aim at one of these only with onearrow and if he can, O Lakshmana, throw the bones of thisdead buffalo at a distance of two hundred bows—I shallconsider Vāli slain.\" Having addressed Rāma thus, Sugriva,having blood-red eyes, thought aside for a moment and againspoke unto Kākuthstha:—\"He is heroic and proud of hisprowess—his heroism and strength are known all over theworld. He is a mighty monkey and incapable of beingrepressed in a battle. His actions are such as are above thepower of the celestials. Revolving them within myself andterrified I have repaired to this mount Rishyamuka. Andthinking of that lord of monkeys, unconquerable andirrepressible I dare not leave this Rishyamuka. And exercisedwith fear and anxiety, therefore, I have been wandering inthis mighty forest along with my devoted counsellors, headedby Hanumān. And having secured in thee a worthy andsincere friend, O best of men, O thou that art lovingunto thy friends, I have taken thy shelter like unto Himāvathimself. Cognizant am I of the prowess of my highlypowerful and wicked brother, but I have never witnessed thine ina conflict, O Rāghava. I do not compare thee with Vāli,nor do I disregard or frighten thee—forsooth have I greatlybeen alarmed by his terrible actions. O Rāghava, thy words,patience and figure are the proofs of thy heroism—truly dothey bespeak of thy valour like unto fire hidden by ashes.\"Hearing those words of the high-souled Sugriva, Rāma,smiling, spoke unto that monkey, saying—\"O monkey, ifthou dost not confide in my valour, soon shall I create thyconfidence about my warlike abilities.\" Having thusaddressed Sugriva and consoling him, the highly powerfulRāghava, of mighty arms—Lakshmana's elder brother, liftingup easily with his thumb the dried frame of that Asura—Dundhuvi—hurled it at a distance of ten yojanas. Beholdingthat Asura's body thrown thus, Sugriva, again addressedunto the heroic Rāma, before Lakshmana and the monkeyherd, the following pregnant words:—\"Friend, formerlythis body was wet and corpulent, and it was thrown withgreat difficulty by my brother Vāli, mad with voluptuousness.And O Rāghava, it is now divested of flesh and hence lightlike unto grass and consequently it has been hurled by theewith ease, O descendant of Raghu. And unable am I toascertain who is the mightier? There is a good deal ofdifference, O Rāghava, between a body, wet and dried.There is still doubt, O worshipful one, which of you is themightier? Truly shall thy strength be manifested in thepiercing of one of these Sala trees. Having stringed thebow like unto the trunk of an elephant and stretching it tothy ears, do thou shoot this mighty arrow. Doubt thatis none that this arrow flung by thee shall bore this Salatree. There is no need of discussion any more; do thou performO king, what dost thou think proper for me,contracted, as thou hast, friendship with me, with a solemnvow. Like unto the sun amongst the planets, like unto theHimalaya amongst the mountains, like unto the lion amongstthe quadrupeds thou art the foremost of men in prowess.\""

  "Āranya, Kishkindhā, and Sundara Kāndam": "Wearing those pleasant words of Sugriva, the highlyeffulgent Rāma, to create his confidence, took up his bow.That one, conferring honors upon others, holding histerrible bow and a shaft, darted it towards the Sāla, filling allthe quarters with a sound. The arrow, clear as the golditself, hurled by that one of mighty strength, perforating thetrees,entered into the mountainous expanse and the sevenfoldregions of the earth. And that shaft, gifted withwonderful velocity, piercing all the trees entered again into thequiver. Having beheld those seven trees bored byRāma's arrow, that monkey chief attained to an excess ofsurprise. Thereupon Sugriva, exceedingly glad, anddelighted with his actions, bowing down his head on the earthand stretching his ornamented person on the ground, addressedwith clasped hands, that heroic descendant of Raghu—Rāma,the foremost of those conversant with religious lore, withthe following pious words—\"O best of men, O lord, what ofVāli, thou art capable of destroying with thy arrows, inthe conflict, even the celestials headed by Indra. O Kākutstha,who can stand before thee in a battle, who hath pierced theseven trees, and the mountain, and the earth with onearrow? Obtaining thee as my friend like unto Mahendra andVaruna, my grief hath been removed and I have attainedto an excess of delight. Do thou, O Kākutstha, even to-daydestroy, for my welfare, my brother Vāli. This I do prayunto thee with folded hands.\" Thereupon embracing-Sugriva, of a pleasant countenance and like unto Lakshmana,the highly wise Rāma spoke unto him, saying, \"Soonshall we repair unto Kishkindhā.—Do thou go before,Sugriva, and invite thy false brother, Vāli, to battle.\"Thereupon proceeding quickly to Kishkindhā, Vāli's capital—theyall stood waiting in that dense forest, hiding themselvesunder the trees. With a view to call Vāli, Sugriva, tyingfast his cloth (around the waist) set up a terrible roar, as ifrending the sky (therewith). Hearing the terrible uproarof his brother, the mighty Vāli, highly angered, issued outof his city, like unto the Sun from the western shores (wherehe sets). Thereupon there arose a mighty conflict betweenVāli and Sugriva like unto the planets Mercury and Marsfighting with each other on the sky. The two brothers,exercised with ire, struck each other with palms like untoAcani and with fists resembling adamant. Thereupon Rāma,with bow in hand, beheld those two heroes resembling eachother, like unto two Açwins. And Rāghava did not dischargethat mortal shaft untill he could perfectly ascertain who wasVāli and who was Sugriva. In the mean time, being defeatedby Vāli, Sugriva fled away and not beholding Rāghava,proceeded towards Rishyamuka. And wearied, worn out withblows, and having his person bathed in blood, he, followed byVāli, angered, entered that mighty forest. Beholding himenter that forest, the highly powerful Vāli could not pursuehim there for fear of the curse but said:—\"Thou art releasedto-day.\" And Rāghava too, with his brother and Hanumān,entered that forest, where the monkey chief Sugriva was.Beholding Rāma approach with Lakshmana, Sugriva, strickenwith shame and casting his looks on the earth, addressedhim poorly, with the following words:—\"Accosting me with'do thou call (Vāli),' displaying thy valour and making mestruck by the enemy, what improper, conduct hast thou shownby me? Thou shouldst have spoken me then truly, O Rāghava,—\"I shall not destroy Vāli\" and I would not have gone there.The high-souled Sugriva speaking thus poorly, Rāghava againspoke unto him, saying:—\"Do thou hear, O Sugriva, Oworshipful one, why I did not discharge my arrow then.By ornaments, dress, stature and movements thyself andVāli are just the same, O Sugriva. By voice, by words, bylooks or by valour, O monkey, I could not make out anydistinction. O best of monkeys, being thus surprised bythe similarity of your countenances I could not dischargethat foe-destroying and quick-coursing shaft. I was soafraid of thy resemblance with Vāli that I thought that lest themortal shaft might destroy thee. O hero, O lord of monkeys,if any disaster befalleth thee, who art already overwhelmedwith miseries, through my ignorance or childishness, theyshall be known all over the world. Mighty is the sin thatariseth from the destruction of one who hath been offeredshelter. Myself, Lakshmana, and that exquisitely finedamsel—Sitā—are all at thy service—thou art our only refugein this forest. Do thou again enter into conflict, therefore,and do not fear, O monkey. And do thou behold even, inthis very moment, Vāli, moving restlessly on the breast ofthe earth, wounded by my shaft. Do thou make some markon thy person, O lord of monkeys, by which I shall be ableto recognize thee when engaged in a duel (with thy brother).O Lakshmana, plucking this auspicious Gaja flower, dothou put it round the neck of the high-souled Sugriva.\"Thereat that highly graceful one with the garland around hisneck appeared like unto a cloud. And appearing in a gracefulperson and attentive to Rāma's words he again enteredKishkindhā with him."

They were followed by theheroic Hanumān, the mighty Nala and Neela, and the highlypowerful Tāra, the leader of the monkey herd. They beheld asthey proceeded, trees, lowered down with the weight of flowers,rivers of clear water flowing to the ocean, mountain hollows,hills, caves, cavities, and principal peaks and charming rills.They beheld on their way, pools filled with water clear asBaidurya and beautified with lotuses—full blown and buds,and resounded with the cries of Kārandhabas, swans, geese,Banchulas, water-fowls, Chakrabakas, and various otherbirds. They surveyed all around in the forest-land, deerranging fearlessly at large and grazing on tender grass.They beheld frightful wild elephants having white teeth,ranging alone—the destroyers of river banks and enemiesof pools. And observing many an infuriated monkey likeunto elephants, resembling so many moveable mountainsriving the mountainous expanses crusted with dust, andmany other wild beasts and birds the followers of Sugrivawended their way. They proceeding quickly, Rāma, thedescendant of Raghu, beholding the forest filled with trees,spake unto Sugriva, saying—\"These trees skirted by plantaingroves, dense as a collection of clouds, appear as clouds inthe sky. Great is my curiosity, O friend, to learn what arethese. And I wish to have my curiosity removed by thee.\"Hearing the words of the high-souled Rāghava, Sugrivabegan to describe that great forest.—\"In this extensiveasylum, O Rāghava, removing the toil (of the travellers)filled with gardens and trees and abounding in deliciousfruits, roots and water, dwelt seven Saints, having controlover their senses. Those seven Saints, dwelling on themountain, passed days and nights in water with their headsdown and after seven nights used to live upon air. Inthis wise, passing seven hundred years they repaired bodilyunto heaven. By virtue of their asceticism, this asylum iswalled by trees and incapable of being conquerred even byIndra, the celestials and the Asuras. Birds or other wildanimals do not enter this asylum; whoever entereth this bymistake never returneth. There is audible, O Rāghava, thesound of the dressing of Apsarās. their sweet-winged accentsand that of their music and drums; and herein pervadeth thecelestial fragrance. Hereburneth the fire Tretā; and the smokeand cloud sable like unto the wings of a pigeon envelope thetops of the trees. And there appear the trees, having theirtops saturated with smoke and cloaked with clouds, likeunto so many Baidurya hills. Do thou, O Rāghava, Ovirtuous-souled one, make obeisance unto them along withthy brother Lakshmana, with concentrated heart and foldedpalms. There resteth no sin in their persons, O Rāma, whobow unto those self-controlled Saints.\" Thereupon Rāma,along with his younger brother Lakshmana, made obeisanceunto those high-souled ones. And having paid homage (untothe sacred memory of those great ones) the virtuous-souledRāma, his (younger) brother Lakshmana, Sugriva and othermonkeys, proceeded with delighted hearts. And wendinga distant way from that hermitage of the seven great ones,they beheld Kishkindhā, hard to conquer and occupied byVāli. Thereupon, Rāma, his younger brother and themonkeys taking their weapons, entered, to encompass thedestruction of their enemies, the city (of Kishkindhā) rearedby the prowess of Indra's son."

Casting his looks all around in the forest, Sugriva,having a huge neck and fond of woods, became exceedinglyenraged. Setting up a terrible uproar and rending thesky with his cry (Sugriva) encircled by his kinsmen, invited(Vāli) to battle. Thereupon roaring like unto a huge cloud,preceded by a mighty wind, Sugriva, gifted with leonine motion,and resembling the newly risen Sun, finding Rāma expert inbusiness, spake unto him, saying:—\"Thou hast readiedKishkindhā, Vāli's capital, adorned with gold, filled withpennons and instruments and surrounded by monkeys. Dothou make good thy promise, O hero, thou hadst madebefore to encompass the destruction of Vāli like unto theseason making the creepers filled with fruits.\" Being thusaccosted by Sugriva, the virtuous-souled Rāghava, the slayerof foes, addressed him with the following words:—\"Uprootingthe Gaja creeper, Lakshmana, hath placed it around thyneck as an emblem (to distinguish thee). Thou dost appearmore beautiful, O hero, with this creeper around thy necklike unto the sun on the sky engarlanded by the stars. Ishall, O monkey, by the discharge of one shaft in the conflictdestroy thy fear and enmity proceeding from Vāli. Do thoushow me, O Sugriva, thy enemy, in the guise of a brother.Wounded (by my shaft) Vāli shall roll in the dust in theforest. And if regaining his life he comes in thy view, dothou leave this field, showering abuses upon me. Thou didstbehold seven Talas riven by a single shaft of mine and didthou therefore consider Vāli destroyed to-day by my prowessin the conflict. Though fallen in distress before, I neverspoke an untruth, being always guided by an inclination toacquire virtue. Like unto the deity of hundred sacrificescausing the rice fields bring forth their fruits by means ofprofuse showers, I shall fulfill my promise by dint of myprowess. Do thou therefore renounce all doubts about it.Do thou call Vāli, wearing a golden garland. Do thou makesuch a sound, O Sugriva, as may bring out that monkey chief(from his city). He hath subdued his breath, is proud ofvictory and fond of warfare; thou couldst not repress himbefore. Forsooth that Vāli shall come out, leaving thecompany (of his wives). Hearing the war cry of his enemy,he shall never put up with it, specially, as he boasteth ofhis prowess before his wives.\" Hearing Rāma's words.Sugriva, having a gold-yellow hue, set up a terrible roar,as if riving the sky. Terrified by that sound, the kine,losing their countenance do move hither and thither like untodamsels, oppressed on account of their kings' neglecting(to protect them). And the deer fly away like unto thehorses defeated in a warfare. And the birds fall down onthe earth, like unto planets, losing their purity. Thereuponconfiding in Rāma's words, that son, of Suryya (Sun) havinghis energy enhanced by means of his prowess resembling theocean agitated by the wind, began to roar like unto cloud."

  "Āranya, Kishkindhā, and Sundara Kāndam": "While residing in the female apartment, Vāli heard theuproar of that high-souled Sugriva—his wrathful brother.And hearing that mighty roar, shaking the whole world ofcreation, his pride was in no time, crushed and he attainedan excess of ire. Thereupon, Vāli, having a golden hue,greatly exercised with wrath, instantly lost the effulgence ofhis person like unto the sun possessed by Rāhu. And lookingterrible by his teeth and having eyes resembling burning firein consequence of ire he appeared like unto a pond, havingthe lotuses thereof uprooted with their stalks and fibres. Andhearing that unbearable sound, the monkey, issued out speedily,as if riving the earth with his foot marks. Embracing himwarmly and showing her affection, Tārā, afraid and mortified,addressed him with the following words, presaging hisfuture welfare:—\"Do thou renounce, O hero, this thy ire,coming like the course of a river, like unto one, leavingaside the garland, which he used in the night, after risingfrom bed. O monkey chief, do thou engage with him inconflict, tomorrow. O hero, thy enemy is very insignificantand hence there will be no deterioration on thy part. Thyhastily issuing out doth not please me; do thou hear, whyI do prevent thee. Formerly this Sugriva invited theeangrily to battle and being defeated and wounded bythee fled away. That one, who had been defeated andharassed by thee formerly, is now calling thee. Indeed it hathexcited my fear. His pride, his energy, and his terrible uproardo indicate that there is nothing insignificant (at thebottom). I do not think Sugriva has come here without anyto assist him. Forsooth he hath taken shelter of some body,and securing which he hath been setting up such a terribleuproar. That monkey is clever by nature and gifted withintellect. And Sugriva shall not desire friendship with anyone without having a test of his prowess. Hearken, O hero,I shall relate unto thee today, the auspicious words, I heardere this, from the prince Angada. He hath related unto meall about Sugriva, what be heard from bis emmissaries whilejourneying in the forest. The two heroic sons of the king ofAyodhyā—Rāma and Lakshmana, incapable of beingdefeated in a battle and born in the race of Ikshawkus, haverepaired unto woods. To accomplish Sugriva's welfare, thosetwo heroes, hard to repress, have come here. He is themain stay of thy brother in the battle; Rāma hath sprungup like unto the fire of dissolution and is the repressor ofenemy's prowess. He is the refuge of the saints and theprime shelter of the afflicted. He is the protector of thosegrinded by their enemies and is the only possessor of fame.He is gifted with knowledge and intellect and ever abidethby his sire's commandments. Like unto Himalaya, theking of mountains, containing diverse metals, he is themine of various accomplishments. It doth not behovethee therefore to enter into conflict with that high-souledRāma, incomparable in prowess and hard to conquer inbattle. Hearken, O hero, I desire to speak something more—I do not wish to excite thy wrath. Do thou instantlyconfer upon Sugriva, the dignity of heir apparent (to thythrone). O hero, O king; do not quarrel with thy youngerbrother. I do consider it thy welfare to contract friendshipwith Rāma and regain Sugriva's affections, renouncing allthy inimical feelings. This thy younger brother, even whenremaining at a distance, should always be maintained by thee.Whether by thee, or at a distance, he is always thy bestfriend—I do not find his equal on earth. By conferring onhim gifts and honors do thou receive him back. And do thourenounce thy enmity and let him sit by thee. Methinks,that large-necked Sugriva is thy best friend—there is noother resource for thee than to secure thy brother's friendship.If thou dost wish to go by my desire, if thou dost regardme as thy well-wisher, do thou perform what I do requestthee for thy welfare. Be pleased and hear my beneficialwords. It doth not behove thee to yield to the influence of ire—thy conflict with that son of the king; of Koçala, gifted withthe prowess of Sakra, will not conduce to thy welfare.\"Thereupon Tārā spoke unto Vāli these suitable andwell-meaning words—but they did not satisfy him, possessed byKāla, as he was, on the eve of his destruction."

  "Āranya, Kishkindhā, and Sundara Kāndam": "After Tārā, having a moon-like countenance, hadspoken thus, Vāli, remonstrated with her and said—\"O thouof exquisite loveliness, my brother, and specially my enemy,is roaring lowly and haughtily—and how shall I put up withit? O timid damsel, heroes, who have never been defeatedand have never fled away from the battle field, had rathermeet with death than put up with this ignominy. I am incapableof bearing this proud uproar of Sugriva, having a defectiveneck and desirous of entering into conflict with me.Fearing danger from Rāghava, thou needst not entertain anyanxiety on my account. Why shall that virtuous-souled andgrateful Rāma perpetrate iniquity? Do thou thereforereturn with my other wives. Why do thou follow me again?Thou hast already shown thy friendship and respect for me.I shall repairing thither, only fight with Sugriva. I shallcrush down his pride and not destroy him. I shall deal withhim mercifully in the battle as thou dost wish and beingstruck with fists and trees he shall fly away. Forsooth, thatvicious-souled one shall not be able to withstand my prideand proficient skill in warfare. O Tārā, thou hast alreadydisplayed thy attachment unto me by giving me goodcounsels. By my life, do thou go back with the othermembers of my household, I shall only return after bringingabout the discomfiture of my brother in the battle.\"Thereupon, Tārā, dexterous and of sweet accents, embracing Vāli,went round him, with tears trickling from her eyes. Andhaving performed Sastayana or the ceremony ofbenediction, that one gifted with a knowledge of Mantras, anddesirous of Vāli's success, went, overwhelmed with grief, tothe inner-apartment in the company of other females. AfterTārā had departed to her own quarters with her femalecompanions, he issued out of the city sighing like an enragedserpent. And the quick-paced Vāli, exceedingly wroth,sighing, cast his looks around with a view to behold hisenemy. And that highly efiulgent one espied Sugriva,having a golden yellow hue, tightly clothed, standing firm onthe earth and shining like unto burning gold. Andbeholding Sugriva stationed thus, the greatly enraged Vāli, ofmighty arms, put on his clothes tightly well. Highlypowerful and closely habited, he, clinching his fists, proceededtowards Sugriva, and waited for the action. Sugriva too,clinching his fist and exceedingly wroth, proceeded towardsVāli, wearing a golden garland. And beholding Sugriva,adept in warfare, having his eyes reddened with ire, advancequickly, Vāli spake:—\"Behold, I have clinched this terriblefist, arranging close my fingers; and one blow from me willtake away thy life.\" Being accosted thus by Vāli, Sugriva,exercised with wrath, spake unto him, saying,—\"This myfist shall strike thee on thy head taking away thy life.\"Thereupon being struck by Vāli, waxing wroth andapproaching him quickly he began to vomit out gore like unto amountain having springs. And Vāli too was struck downby Sugriva, fearlessly taking up a Sāla tree, like unto amountain clapped by a thunderbolt. Being thus smitten bythe tree and overwhelmed with the strike of Sāla he wastroubled like unto a heavily laden boat in the midst of anocean. And these (two brothers) gifted with mighty strengthand prowess and motion of Suparna, and having huge personsfought with each other like unto the Sun and Moon on thesky. They were inimical to each other and intent on findingtheir mutual dark sides. And Vāli, gifted with strength andprowess, fared better in the conflict, and that highlypowerful son of Sun—Sugriva, was worsted. And having hispride crushed down by Vāli and strength greatly reduced,Sugriva in anger pointed him out unto Rāma. Thereuponthere took place a mighty conflict between them like untoVitra and Vasava by means of trees with branches, hills,nails, hard as thunderbolts, fists, knees, legs and arms. Andthese two monkeys ranging in the forest, fought with eachother, having their persons bathed in blood, and roaringlike unto clouds. And Rāghava again and again beheld theweak points of that monkey chief Sugriva, losing his strengthby and by. And beholding that chief of monkeys greatlydistressed, the highly powerful and heroic Rāma cast hislooks upon his shaft, having the destruction of Vāli in view.And fixing on his bow an arrow resembling a serpent, hestretched it like unto Death drawing out his cycle of time.Being terrified by the sound of his stringing of the bow thebirds and beasts, dismayed as on the eve of dissolution, fledaway into different quarters. And a mighty shaft, like ontothunderbolt and resembling flaming fire, being hurled byRāma, alighted on the breast of Vāli. Being wounded bythat shaft that highly powerful chief of monkeys, gifted withprowess fell down on the earth. Like unto Sakra's bannerin the full-moon of Aswin, Vāli, with his throat choked withvapor, losing all sense and sighing hard, fell dead downto the ground. As the great God Hara emitted forth firewith smoke from his mouth, so that best of men like untoDeath hurled an excellent, flaming and foe-destroying shaft,resembling gold and death itself. Thereupon being bathedin blood that son of Vāsava, fell senseless on the ground, inthe conflict like unto a blossoming Asoka growing on a hilland Sakra's banner struck down on the earth."

Thatlord of monkeys being levelled to the ground, his kingdomappeared like unto the sky, shorn of the Moon. Though struckdown to the earth, neither vitality, effulgence nor prowessdid renounce the body of that high-souled one.

Being adorned with that golden garland, thatheroic lord, of monkey-herds, appeared like unto an eveningcloud. Though felled to the ground, his beauty appeared asif divided into three, namely, his garland, his body and theshaft piercing his heart. The arrow thrown off Rāma's bowpointing out unto him the way to the celestial region, becamean excellent means to that hero. Beholding the broad-chestedand mighty-armed Vāli, Mahendra's son, wearing a goldengarland and having a flaming countenance and yellow eyes,thus struck down to the earth, resembling a flameless fire inthe field of battle, like unto Yayati, slipped from the abodeof the celestials on the wane of his peity, like unto atree falling down to the earth at the time of Dissolution,hard to repress as Mahendra himself, incapable towithstand like Upendra, Rāma, followed by Lakshmana,approached and beheld him. And paying respects unto that herofalling on the earth like unto a flameless fire and eying himagain and again those two highly powerful brothers, Rāmaand Lakshmana neared him. And beholding that highlypowerful Rāghava and Lakshmana, Vāli addressed themwith the following bold and pious words. And thereuponVāli, of mitigated prowess, waning vitality, motionless andstretched on the ground, spoke unto Rāma, proud of warfare,saying these pregnant words.—\"What merit hast thoureaped by destroying me, who was not engaged in fight withthee? I was exercised with ire, being engaged in conflict(with another person) and for thee I have met withdestruction. People speak highly of thee, O Rāma, on this earth,describing thee as coming of a high family, gifted withmanliness and prowess, ever engaged in the welfare of thysubjects, compassionate, energetic, of firm resolution andknowing time. Punishment, control of passions, forgiveness,piety, firmness, truth, prowess and suppression of thewicked—these all are the royal virtues. And knowing thyhigh pedigree, and all these thy accomplishments I approachedSugriva with a hostile intention, albeit prevented by Tārā.Before I saw thee I had thought within myself:—'ForsoothRāma shall not destroy me, engaged as I am with anotherperson and hence not prepared to fight with him.' I do nowknow thee as one who hath spoliated his soul throughimpious actions, feigning religion while in truth anirreligious person, resorting to all vicious deeds, like untoa well crusted with grass, unrighteous while passing underthe cloak of honesty and religion like unto a hidden fire. Ihave not done thee any wrong either in thy kingdom or inthy city. Nor have I passed by thee. Why hast thou thendestroyed me, who am a monkey ranging always in thewoods, living on fruits and roots and who have come here tofight with anpther person? It appears that thou art of akingly father and of a graceful countenance. And, O king,there are marks of piety on thy person. Who, born in therace of Kshatryas, versed in religious lore, having his doubtsremoved and marks of peity on his person, perpetrates suchan iniquitous deed? Thou art born in the family of Raghus andknown all over the world as being pious. Being clothed inrighteousness why dost thou commit such an unrighteous act?Chastisement, charity, forgiveness, piety, truthfulness firm-ness, prowess and the punishment of the iniquitous are thevirtues of a king, O prince. We are, O Rāma, wild beastsranging in the forest and living on roots and fruits—ournature is such—but thou art a man, O king. Land, gold andsilver are the causes of dissension. But who is there who isavaricious enough to get by our forest habitations andfruits? The royal virtue consists in humbly and freelyadministering discipline, favour and punishment. Kingsby no means, should follow their whims. But thou art angryand unsteady by nature, capricious, perfectly narrow-mindedin the discharge of thy royal duties and dost use thy bow andshafts (any where and every time). Thou hast no attachmentfor virtue, no comprehension of right things and art alwaysguided by thy passions albeit thou art a lord of men. OKākutstha, destroying me sinless, with thy shaft andperpetrating such a digraceful act, how shalt thou relate it unto thepious. Those, who commit treason, destroy Brahmins and kine,who are theives and always engaged in the destruction ofanimals, and who are athiests and marry before their elderbrothers are married, do all go to hell. The villainous, theavaricious, those who kill their friends and elope with theirpreceptor's wives, do always visit the land of the vicious. Andthere is not the least doubt about it. My skin is npt worthy ofthy touch and my bones and hairs should always be avoidedby the Virtuous. And my flesh is not worthy of being eatenby persons of thy piety. A hedge-hog a porcupine, an iguana,a hare and a tortoise—these five animals only, having five toes,are worthy of being eaten by the Kshatryas and Brahmins,O Rāghava. The wise, O R£ma, do not touch my skin andbones and my flesh is not worthy of being taken—I am that(monkey) having five toes who have been killed by thee.Alas! disregarding the well meaning and truthful words ofTārā, I have placed myself under the control of Kāla(Death). O Kākuthstha, the Earth hath got thee as herhusband like unto a good natured damsel being wedded toa husband who hath forsaken his own religion. How artthou, who art wicked, narrow-minded, a liar and ever intentupon bringing about others' misfortune, born of theloins of the high-souled Daçaratha? I have been killed byan elephant—Rāma, disregarding the virtue of the pious,breaking the chord of character, and neglecting the goad ofreligion. Perpetrating this inauspicious, and improper act,blamed of the worthy what shalt thou speak unto the piouswhen thou shalt return in their company? The prowess, thouhast displayed towards me, careless, O Rāma thou dost neveremploy for the suppression of the iniquitous. O sonof a king, hadst thou fought with me openly thou wouldsthave, forsooth, seen the abode of Death being killedby me. O Rāma, like unto a serpent destroying personsasleep, thou, that art under the control of vice, hast killedme, who am hard to repress, keeping thyself out of my sightin the battle. I have been killed by thee, desirous ofencompassing Sugriva's well being. Hadst thou apprizedme of thy object before, I would have got thee thy Maithiliin the course of a day, and brought, by the neck, thatvicious-souled Rākshasa—Rāvana, the ravisher of thy spousewithout putting an end to his life in the battle. Whether in thedeep ocean or in the region under the earth, I shall bringthy Maithili like unto an Ashyatari.110 It is perfectly properthat Sugriva shall inherit my kingdom on my ascension toheaven. And it is equally improper that I have beenviciously killed by thee in the battle. Every one in time meetswith death and hence there is nothing to be sorry for me.But do thou think of a proper reply thou shalt give to thepeople (when asked about the cause of my destruction).\"Having said this, that high-souled Son of monkey-chief,greatly distressed being wounded by (Rāma's) shaft andhaving his countenance dried up, became silent, fixing hislook upon Rāma, resembling the sun."

  "Āranya, Kishkindhā, and Sundara Kāndam": "And thus Rāma was addressed by Vāli, wounded andsenseless, with those modest, pious and auspicious words.And being thus reproached he spoke unto that excellent lordof monkeys, gifted with virtue and other accomplishments,resembling the Sun shorn of its lustre, a cloud which hasalready discharged its waters and fire extinguished.—\"Notcognizant of virtue, knowledge, passion and custom, whydost thou blame me like a child? Why dost thou purposeto address me thus out of fickleness, consequent upon thymonkeyhood not asking thy wise elders recognized by thepreceptors? This land, abounding in hills and woods, belongsto the Ikswakus. Along with it was conferred on them thepower of administering favour and chastisement untobeasts, birds and human beings. The upright, virtuous andtruthful king Bharata, cognizant of virtue, knowledge andpassion and ever engaged in adminstering favour andpunishment, governs this kingdom. That king is said to becognizant of time and place; in him dwelleth modesty,truthfulness, prowess and a love for discipline. Ourselves andother kings, being commanded by him to practise piety, havebeen journeying in this wide world desirous of multiplyingvirtue. That foremost of monarchs, Bharata—lover of virtue,governing this entire earth, who dares perpetrate an iniquity?Stationed in the excellent virtue of our own and placingBharata' s commandments on our heads, we shall considerhow we shall punish them who go astray (from the path ofvirtue). Thou hast oppressed virtue and perpetrated agross iniquity. Thou hast placed thyself under the controlof thy passions and deviated from the track of royal duties.The elder brother, father, and the instructor—these threeshould always be regarded in the light of a father if they treadthe paths of virtue and morality. A younger brother, a sonand an accomplished follower should always be regarded assons. And virtue is always at the bottom of all suchconsiderations. O monkey, the religion of the good is indeed verysubtle and can comprehend great things—the immortal soulcan understand what is good or bad. Fickle as thou art, howcanst thou comprehend what is proper, consulting with thymonkey companions who are equally stupid and light-hearted,like unto one, born blind, leading with another such? Ido fairly speak unto thee that it is not anger only that hasled me to bring about thy destruction. Do thou considerwhy I have killed thee—thou hast ravished thy brother's wiferenouncing that ever-existing virtue. Thou, the perpetratorof many evil deeds, hast got by Rumā, the wife of thy brother—the high-souled Sugriva. O monkey, thou hast thusviolated the path of virtue. And thus I have punished theewho hast ravished thy elder brother's spouse. O thou, theleader of monkey-herds—I find no other alternative than topunish him who acts against humanity and violates the sacredsanctions of custom. I am a Kshatrya coming of a highpedigree. I cannot put up with thy immoral conduct. Sastrassanction the destruction of one who under the influence ofpassion ravishes his own daughter, sister and youngerbrother's wife. This is Bharata's commandment—the lordof earth, and we have been satisfying his orders. Thou hastdisregarded virtue. A wise man, living in virtue, cannotlet go one who hath passed by the sanctions of morality.Bharata hath sanctioned the destruction of the amorous;and we, O lord of monkeys, following his orders, thoughproper, to encompass the destruction of one like thee whohath spoliated virtue and morality. Like unto Lakshmana,I have contracted friendship with Sugriva. And with a viewto regain his wife and kingdom, he resolved to engage in mywell-being. I too also promised the same before the monkeys.And how can a man of my position neglect to make goodhis promise? For these causes of very great moment,favoured by virtue, I have administered unto thee thiscondign punishment. Do thou now approve it. Thydiscomfiture is quite of a piece with the sanctions of morality—and to assist friends is one of the codes of religion. Hear,Manu hath composed a couple of couplets tending to thepurification of character and highly prized by the virtuous aswell as myself. Those who, perpetrating iniquity, bear withfortitude the punishment, inflicted by their soverign get atthe abode of the celestials being purified like unto the pious.People are freed from their sins, when they confessing theircrimes, are either punished or forgiven. But the monarchwho doth not punish the perpetrator of an evil deed, isvisited by a mighty sin. Formerly an iniquity, like oneperpetrated by thee, was committed by a devotee whowas punished severely by my forefather Māndhāta. Andother lords of earth punish in the same way the authors ofmisdeeds. What more, the perpetrators of crime, themselvesundergo penances and are thus released from their sins.Therefore do not repent any more, O best of monkeys. Thepunishment, I have inflicted on thee, is in consonance withthe sanctions of morality. We are not our own masters.Hearken, O best of monkeys, there is another argument (forthy destruction); and hearing which, O great hero, itbehoveth thee to renounce thy ire. Many persons living on flesh,either lying in ambush, or openly catch and pierce by meansof net, noose and trap, many a deer, terrified and trusted,taking to their heels or quarrelling with their companions,careful or careless. They are not to blame in this and I donot cherish, O best of monkeys, any mortification or ire forthis. And even many royal ascetics, versed in religiouslore, go a-hunting; and hence thou hast been killed by mewith a shaft, O monkey, in the conflict. And I am justifiedin killing thee, whether thou dost fight or not since thou arta monkey. There is no doubt, O best of monkeys, that themonarchs confer life and piety auspicious and hard toattain. It doth not therefore behove any one to injure them,to blame them and to use improper words by them—sincethey are the celestials ranging on this earth under thesemblance of man. Not knowing virtue and growing angrywhy dost thou blame me who am following the religion ofmy forefathers?\" Being thus accosted by Rāma, Vāli, greatlymortified and informed of the principle of religion, observedno delinquency in Rāghava. Thereupon that lord ofmonkeys spake unto Rāma, with folded hands, saying\"There is not the least doubt, O best of men, in all that thouhast said. An inferior person can by no means address hissuperior improperly. It doth not behove thee, O Rāghava,therefore to blame me for those unpleasant words which I usedtowards thee, out of foolishness. Thou hast acquired apractical mastery over the principles of religion and artever engaged in the welfare of thy subjects. Thy eternalpower of ascertaining the crime and meeting its condignpunishment is perfectly clear. Do thou know me as theforemost of sinners and one who hath deviated from the trackof morality. Do thou conduct me, with pious words, to abetter land.\" Vāli, having his throat choked with vapour,addressed again and again, Rāma, with piteous accents,saying:—\"I do not mourn so much for me, Tārā, or otherfriends as for my son Angada, eldest and wearing a goldenAngada.111 Brought up by me from his very infancy, he shallby my separation, wear away like unto a pond having itsliquid contents drunk up by an elephant. He is my onlyson, dear and born of Tārā. A mere child and of unripeunderstanding as he is, that one of mighty strength shouldalways be protected by thee, O Rāma. Do thou regardfavourably Sugriva and Angada. Thou art their protector, andchastiser punishing them for their sins. O king, O lord ofmen, it behoveth thee to regard Sugriva and Angada in thesame light in which thou regardest Bharata and Lakshmana.It behoveth thee to so arrange as Sugriva may not disregardthat chaste Tārā who is blameable for my folly only. He,who is favoured by thee, abideth by thy commandments andacteth after thy heart, can acquire kingdom, attain to heaven,and govern the earth. Desiring to have my destructionbrought about by thee, I entered into conflict with my brotherSugriva, albeit prevented by Tārā.\" Having addressedRāma thus, the lord of monkeys stopped. Thereupon Rāmaconsoled Vāli, of clear understanding with the following moralwords, acceptable unto the Saints. \"O best of monkeys, dothou not consider ourselves as well as thyselfblameable. We are more conversant, than thou, with theprinciples of religion. They never lose their virtue beingproficient in the mode of ascerting crime and punishing it—oneadministering punishment unto the criminal and thecriminal receiving it. And therefore receiving punishment(from me) thou hast been released from thy sins andacquired a knowledge of religion. Do thou therefore renouncethy grief, thy illusion and the fear that is lurking inthy heart. It is impossible for thee, O foremost ofmonkeys, to withstand the course of dispensation. There isnot the least doubt, O lord of monkeys, that Angada shallbe brought up by me and Sugriva in the same way as he wasby thee.\" Hearing these sweet, collected and pious wordsof the high-souled Rāma,—the represser of the enemies in abattle,—the monkey again addressed him with the followingpregnant words—\"O lord, O thou having Mahendra's prowess,I do propitiate thee for my having insulted thee withimproper words, senseless as I was being wounded by shafts.Do thou forgive me, O lord of monkeys.\""

  "Āranya, Kishkindhā, and Sundara Kāndam": "Being thus accosted with reasonable words, that lord, ofmonkeys, lying on the ground and wounded with shafts, gaveno reply. Having his limbs dissevered by stones, beingstruck with trees and wounded by Rāma's shaft, he becamesensetess at the approach of death. His spouse Tārā heardthat Vāli, the foremost of monkeys, had been killed in theconflict by Rāma's shaft. Hearing the heart-rending newsof her husband's demise, she, big with a child, issuedout of the mountain cave with a troubled heart. Andbeholding Rāma with a bow in his hand, the mightymonkeys, followers of Angada, fled away, terrified. ThereuponTārā observed those monkeys flying away terrified like untodeer alienated from their herd, having lost their king. Andthe chaste lady, racked with sorrow, spoke unto thosemonkeys, afraid of Rāma, wounded with shafts andexercised with grief, saying:—\"O monkeys, why are ye dying away,terrified and distressed, leaving behind that foremost ofkings before whom ye were used to fight? Hath Vāli beenkilled by Rāma, waiting at a distance with fleet and distantcoursing shafts, being requested by Sugriva for kingdom?\"Hearing the words of that wife of the monkey, they, wearingshapes at will, addressed that damsel with words, worthyof being said on that occasion,—\"O thou, having thy sonalive, do thou go back and bring up thy son Angada. Deathhimself, under Rāma's semblance, hath snatched away Vāli.He was killed by (Rāma's) shafts, resembling thunderbolts,as if clapped by thunder itself, having bored trees and bigstones (hurled by Vāli). That king of monkeys, havingSakra's prowess, being made away with, this host of monkeyshave been taking to their heels being overwhelmed withconsternation. Let the heroes defend the city and installAngada on the throne. And on his being installed themonkeys shall serve Vāli's son. O thou having a finecountenance, the monkeys shall enter this stronghold, althoughit is a favourite place with thee. Herein dwell manyforest-rangers, wifeless and having wives. And we are reallyafraid of them, avaricious, and formerly deprived of theirwealth by us.\" Hearing those words of the monkeys, lyingat a little distance, that lady, smiling sweet, spoke unto them,words worthy of herself—\"That great lord of monkeys, myhusband, being dead, what shall I do with my son, mykingdom and myself? I shall place myself at the feet of thathigh-souled one, who hath been killed by Rāma's shaft.\"Having said this, (Tārā) proceeded, overwhelmed with grief,weeping and striking her bead with her hands. Whileproceeding, she espied her husband lying on the ground likeunto the destroyer of the lords of monkeys who have neverbeen discomfitted in a battle field, hurling mountains likeunto Vāsava hurling thunderbolts; emitting a roar like untoa big cloud assisted by a mighty wind; resembling Sakrain prowess and like unto a cloud accompanied by rain; therepresser of repressers; a mighty hero discomfitted by anequally powerful one; like unto a lion killed by a tiger forflesh; worshipped of all mem; like unto a chaitya,112 adornedwith pennons and altars, scattered and broken by Garudawith a view to kill serpents. And she espied Rāma reclininghis person on a mighty bow, his younger brother and herhusband's younger brother. Passing them by and gettingat her husband and beholding him killed in battle, she, losingher senses fell down to the ground. And thereupon risingagain like one asleep, she, beholding her husband engarlandedby death, cried aloud, exclaiming \"O son of worshipfulsire.\" And beholding Tārā like unto a she-elephant andAngada, bewailing in this wise, Sugriva attained to an excessof grief."

And seeinghim slain with shafts like unto an elephant, resembling a lordof mountains and an uprooted tree, Tārā, racked with griefbegan to bewail—\"O hero, O foremost of monkeys, O powerfulone, O thou terrible in warfare, why dost thou not welcomeme to-day who am guilty of some iniquity by thee? Rise,O best of monkeys, and lie down on a better bed; monarchsdo not stretch themselves on earth. O lord of earth, indeedearth is thy favourite wife; since renouncing me, thou,though dead, art serving her with thy body. Evident it is,O hero, that while engaged in a lawful conflict, thou hadstcreated another city of Kishkindhā,in the region of thecelestials. All thy enjoyments with me in nectar-smelling woods,have been brought to a close. Thou, the lord ofmonkey-herds, being slain, I am deprived of joy and hope andam sunk in the abyss of grief. Forsooth, my heart isuncommon hard, since beholding thee on the ground it hath notbeen sundered into thousand pieces being overwhelmed withgrief. Sugriva's wife was carried away and banished by theeand this is the result of thy action, O foremost of monkeys.O lord of monkeys, out of thy ignorance thou didst neglectall my well meaning words which I said, being intent on thywelfare and benefit. O worshipful one, thou shalt captivatetoday, the hearts of the dexterous Apsarās, proud of theiryouth and beauty. Forsooth, thou hast been by force broughtunder the control of Kāla, since thou hast been discomfittedby Sugriva, albeit thou art above the control of others.Destroying Vāli unseasonably, while engaged in conflict withanother person, and perpetrating such an iniquitous deed,Kākuthstha doth never relent. Unused to miseries beforehow shall I, being an object commiseration, put up like onehelpless, with my widow-hood and grief. How shall theheroic and youthful Angada, brought up in luxury andhappiness, be regarded by his uncle, senseless with wrath? Dothou cast for good, O my son, thy looks towards thy pioussire, for since now it will be hard for thee to see him again.Do thou console thy son, favour me with orders, smell hishead, as thou art going to journey in a foreign land.

O Sugriva,do thou gain thy ends and get back thy Rumā; devoid ofanxiety do thou govern thy kingdom—thy enemy, thy brotherhath been slain. O lord of monkeys, why dost thou notwelcome me, thy beloved spouse, who am bewailing thus?Behold, thy other wives are also mourning in the same wise.\"Hearing the bewailings of that she-monkey, others, takingAngada, distressed and overwhelmed with grief, began tocry piteously.—\"O hero, having Angada on thy arms, whyart thou proceeding on a journey for good in a foreign landleaving behind (thy son) Angada. It doth not behove thee (toleave aside) thy dear son, gifted with diverseaccomplishments and wearing a charming and beautiful cloth.

Why dost thou mourn for others, thyself being anobject of moruning? Why dost thou feel commisseration forthe poor, thyself being poorly? In this body like unto a babblewho is there who mourneth for another? It behoveth theenow, O thou having thy son alive, to look after princeAngada and think of those duties which remain to beexecuted by thee (after the demise of Vāli).

It doth not behove thee, O learned damsel, to mournlike others. He even, who (while living) was surrounded bythousands of monkeys cherishing hopes, hath met hisdestined end. This hero discharged his royal duties inconsonance with the sanctions of morality and was giftedwith various kingly accomplishments such as conciliation,charity and forgiveness. He hath attained to the land ofkings and it becometh thee not to mourn for him.

Welcoming that lord of monkeys withclear accents, Vāli addressed him affectionately saying:—\"OSugriva, do thou not take to thy heart the improper conductI have shown towards thee, being attracted by inevitablefoolishness, subject as I was to sin. Methinks, O brother, itis not our fortune to enjoy at the same time the double blissof fraternal affection and the enjoyment of kingdom, or elsewhy has it happened otherwise? Do thou acquire to-daythis kingdom of the forest-ranges and know me as one whohath departed to the abode of Death. Soon shall I renouncemy life, kingdom, my exquisite grace and my blamelessfame. It behoveth thee, O hero, O king, to perform whatI shall speak unto thee in this plight, however difficult itmight be. Do thou behold Angada fallen on the ground withtears in his eyes—a little boy, incapable, brought up inluxury and deserving happiness. Do thou maintain this myson, dearer than my life, like unto thy own son, born of thyloins, satisfying all his wants in my absence. O best ofmonkeys, like unto me, thou art his father, protector,conferrer of gifts and remover of fear. This graceful son ofTārā equals thee in prowess and shall precede thee in thedestruction of Rākshasas. This youthful Angada, Tārā'sson, gifted with energy and strength, shall perform befittingexploits displaying his prowess in the battle. Surasen'sdaughter is wonderfully expert in ascertaining subtle thingsand giving counsels in the time of danger. Do thou, withoutthe least doubt perform what shall the chaste lady instructthee to do; for Tārā's advice never goes without effect. Itbehoveth thee to perform Rāghava's service fearlessly or elsethou shalt be visited with sin: on his being insulted thoushalt be injured. O Sugriva, do thou put on this celestialgolden garland—herein dwelleth the bounteous Sree whoshall renounce me after my death.\" Having been accostedthus by Vāli, out of fraternal affection, Sugriva renouncingjoy again became pale like unto the Moon possessed by Rāhu.Renouncing his inimical feelings, being thus addressed byVāli and carrying out his words energetically Sugrivaaccepted the golden garland as ordered (by him). Andconferring (upon Sugriva) that golden garland and beholdinghis son before him, Vāli, resolved upon death, spake untoAngada, saying:—\"Do thou place thyself now under thecontrol of Sugriva, ascertaining time and place, putting upwith misery for thy welfare and injury. O thou having longarms, Sugriva shall not regard thee much, if dost thou remainin the same wise in which thou hadst been brought up byme before.113 O slayer of foes, do thou never mix withSugriva's enemies, and place thyself always under Sugriva'scontrol, having subdued thy senses and being intent upon thymaster's (Sugriva's) welfare. Do thou not cultivate too muchof friendship nor be wanting in it—for both of these extremesare sources of disasters. Do thou therefore follow the goldenmean.\" After he had said this, his eyes became expanded, histeeth were opened and his appearance became ghastly. Andgreatly pained by shafts he breathed his last. Andthereupon, the monkeys, the foremost of those who go jumping,having lost their chief, bewailed and cried. On that monkeychiefs departure to the land of celestials, Kishkindhā wasdivested of her lord, and gardens, hills and woods were allrendered lonely. That best of monkeys, who fought adreadful battle with the high-souled Gandharbas, being dead,all other monkeys became of pale countenance. \"Vāli enteredinto a terrible conflict with the mighty-armed Golava andfought for ten years and five, for nights and days withoutrespite. And on the sixteenth year, Golava was killed.Bringing about the destruction of that wicked Gandharba,Vāli, having terrible teeth, saved us all from fear. How hathhe been killed to-day?\" Like unto kine, incapable of enjoyingpeace in a mighty forest filled with lions, their chief being dead,these forest-rangers could not attain to felicity on the demiseof that lord of monkeys. Thereupon, Tārā, sunk in thegulf of disaster, eying the countenance of her deceased lord,fell down to the ground embracing Vāli like unto a creeperclinging for its support to a mighty but broken tree."

Olord of monkeys, the earth is dearer unto thee than I, sincethou art lying there embracing her and art not welcoming me.O hero, O dear, O brave lord, wonder it is that God underthe semblance of Rāma, hath placed himself under thecontrol of Sugriva; hithertofore he shall be regarded as ahero. Why art thou not awake, hearing the bewailings ofbears and monkeys who used to wait upon thee, powerful,as well as that of Angada and myself? Alas! thou art lyingon this bed of the heroes, being slain in the battle, whereformerly, thy enemies destroyed by thee, used to lie down.thou born of a pure family, O thou that art fond of warfare,O my dear, O conferror of honors, whither hast thou departedmaking me husbandless? Let not the wise, henceforth,confer their daughters upon the heroes. Alas! behold me,the wife of a hero, made a widow in no time. Shatteredis my honor and destroyed is my happiness and I am sunkin the deep abyss of grief. Forsooth, this my firm heart isnot sundered into hundred pieces, beholding my husbandslain! Thou art my friend, my dear husband and a greathero—and thou hast met with destruction, being struck byanother man. A husbandless woman is always styled by thewise as widow, although she might have a son and enoughof riches. O hero, thou art lying down in a pool of bloodissuing out of thy own person, like unto thy own bed havinga red-dyed bed-sheet. Thy body is on all sides besmearedwith blood and dust and I am incapable of embracing theewith my arms, O best of monkeys. Surely hath Sugrivasatisfied his hostile intention to-day, whose fear hath beenremoved by one shaft, discharged by Rāma. Thyselfdeparting to the land of the dead, I have been eying thee simply,being prevented from touching thy person by the shaftpiercing thy heart\".114 Thereupon Neela took out that shaftfrom the person of (Vāli) like unto a flaming serpent lurkingin a mountain cave. There beamed the shaft extractedfrom his body like unto the rays of the Sun, stationed on thesummit of the setting hill. And there poured forth from allhis wounds, streams of blood, like unto showers of meltedcopper and other metals falling from a mountain. And(Tārā) washed, with tears, her heroic husband's bodycovered with dust and wounded with weapons. Beholdingher husband thus slain and besmeared with blood, she spakeunto her son, Angada, having coppery eyes,saying:—\"Beholdthis terrible declining stage of thy Sire. Here is the end of hishostilities collected by his impious actions. O my son, dothou bow unto thy kingly father, the conferrer of honors, whohath departed to the abode of Death, having a flaming personlike unto the rising Sun.\" Thus accosted, Angada rose upand, saying, \"I (do touch my Sire's feet),\" embraced his father'sfeet with his plump arms. (Thereupon Tārā said)—\"Saying'Do thou live long' why dost thou not welcome Angada,to-day as before, who hath bowed unto thee? I am withmy son, standing by thee who art dead, like unto a cowwith her calf, having the bull slain by a lion. How hast thou,without me, thy wife, bathed in the water of Rāma's shafts, atthe end of thy battle-like sacrifice? Why do I not behold herethat favourite golden garland of thine, which was conferredon thee by the lord of celestials, pleased in a battle? Royalgrace hath not renounced thee, O conferrer of honors, albeitthou art dead, like unto the rays not quitting the king ofmountains, even after the Sun is set. Thou didst not act bymy wholesome words, nor could I prevent thee. And I amnow destroyed with my son, along with thee in the battle.Truly hath Sree (goddess of wealth) renounced me.\""

  "Āranya, Kishkindhā, and Sundara Kāndam": "Beholding Tārā emerged in a deep and mighty oceanof grief, Vāli's younger brother was overwhelmed withpenitence, in consequence of the unbecoming destruction of hisbrother. And seeing her countenance full of tears, thehigh-souled (Sugriva), racked with grief and repentance,approached slowly Rāma along with his followers. And nearinghim, with a bow in his hand, having arrows like unto serpents,famed and having auspicious marks on his person, he spakeunto Rāghava, seated there, saying—\"O lord of men, thouhast fulfilled thy promise by carrying it out into practice;and as for wretched me, O son of a king, I shall refrain todayfrom all enjoyments. This queen lamenting piteously, thesesubjects and retinue bewailing, being overwhelmed with grief,this king being slain, how can kingdom please me? O Rāmaout of anger, and passion, and on account of my beinginsulted by him, I did formerly desire to bring about my brother'sdestruction. But that lord of monkey-herds being slain,best of Ikshwākus, I am truly pierced to the quick withanguish. I do prefer living for good in the mountRishyamuka, earning my livelihood somehow or other, to theaccession of heaven by destroying (Vāli). This highlyintellectual and high-souled one spake unto me \"Do thourange at large, I do not wish to destroy thee.\" Suchwords were really becoming of him, O Rāma. And thesewords and this action become me (vile as I am). Howcan a brother, O Rāma, however avaricious he nightbe, relish the destruction of his qualified brother,comparing the happiness of a kingdom, with the grief(consequent upon his brother's demise)? He did not desireto slay me, lest his greatness might be spoiled; but alas!through my wicked sense, I performed an iniquity bytaking the life of my brother. Being struck by him withbranches of trees, while I fled away and wept, he, consolingme, said only \"Do not do this again. \" He all alongmaintained his fraternal feelings, his honesty and piety; but (woeto me) I have displayed my wrath, passion and monkey-hood.O friend, like unto the lord of celestials perpetrating sinby destroying Biswarupa, I have been, by bringing aboutthe destruction of my brother, visited with this sin, beyondcomprehension, avoidable, undesirable and invisible. Indra'ssin was shared by earth; water, trees and women; but whois there who will bear and desire to participate this monkey'ssin? Perpetrating such an improper and irreligious act,tending to the decay of my family, I do not deserve the respect ofmy subjects and the heir-apparentship; what of kingdom, ORāghava. I am the perpetrator of a vile anddisgraceful sin, blamed of all in this world. And like unto acurrent of rain going downwards, this mighty grief hathovercome me. This mighty and infuriated elephant of a sin,having the destruction of a brother as its body, repentence,as its trunk, head, eyes and tusks, hath been crushing melike unto the banks of a river. Alas! O best of kings, thisunbearable sin hath been driving away all pious feelings frommy heart like unto alloy leaking out of discolored gold whenmolten in fire, O Rāghava. Methinks, for me, O Rāghava,these mighty monkeys and Angada are almost half-dead(with grief). A good-natured and obedient son is rare. Whereis to be found Angada's equal? O hero, there is no suchland where I may meet again my brother. The heroic Angadashall not live to-day—and if he lives, his mother shall live tobring him up. Forsooth, without her son, she shall notlive long. Therefore shall I enter this flaming fire with aview to place myself on the same level with my brotherand his son and all these mighty monkeys shall engagein quest of Sitā, abiding by thy commandments. O son ofa king, they shall all carry out thy orders even in my absence,do thou,therefore, order me (to enter fire) who am the destroyerof my own race, have performed an inquity and do notdeserve living any more.\" Hearing the words of Vāli'syounger brother, who was bewailing thus, Rāma, the heroicdescendant of Rāghu and the slayer of foes, remained stupifiedfor some time with tears in his eyes. In the mean-time, Rāma,patient like unto the protector of the world, worked withcuriosity, looked again and again towards the bewailing Tārāsunk in the gulf of disaster. Thereupon the principalcounsellors raised up the brave spouse of the lord of monkeys,having graceful eyes and lying ou the earth, embracing herhusband. And snatched away from her husband andtrembling, she beheld Rāma, with bow and arrows in his hand,burning like unto the Sun by virtue of his own effulgence. Andbeholding him gifted with all royal marks, having beautifuleyes and never seen before, that one, having the eyes ofa fawn, thought within herself. \"This great one mustbe Kākuthstha.\" And the worshipful Tārā, worked withgrief, and overwhelmed with disasters, bewailing, nearedquickly that high-souled one, resembling the lord of celestialsand hard to approach. And having reached the pure-souledRāma, who had his ends fully attained in battle, thehigh-minded Tārā, having her frame worked with grief, spakeunto him, saying:—\"Thou art immeasurable, hard toapproach, highly pious, prudent, of controlled senses andincreasing fame, forgiving like unto earth and of blood-redeyes. Thou hast bow and arrows in hand, art highly powerfuland of a tough body. And renouncing human grace thathast assumed the grace of a celestial person. Do thou slayme with that self-same shaft with which my dear one wasslain. And thus slain, O hero, I shall be near him, for Vālii dothnot relish the company of any other woman but me. Othou having eyes resembling clean lotus-petals, this(hero) departing to the abode of celestials and notbeholding me there, shall not delight in the company ofApsarās, wearing diversified garments and copper-coloredcorronets. Even in the land of celestials, O hero, Vālishall turn pale with grief in my separation, like untothee in the picuresque dale of the Lord of mountains,separated from the daughter of the king of Videha. Thou knowestwell that a handsome man is greatly afflicted with theseparation of his spouse; and knowing this, do thou slay me,and Vāli shall not be tormented with grief consequent uponmy absence. High-souled as thou art, thou art thinking thatthou shalt, slaying me, be visited with a sin arising from thedestruction of a female. But do thou kill me, O son of aking, knowing me as the soul of Vāli, and thou shalt not beresponsible for destroying a woman. According to the Vedasand various other sacred texts, wives are inseparably blendedwith their husbands. And the wise say that there is noother gift better than that of a wife in this world. Thoushalt, O hero, confer me religiously upon my dear oneand by this gift thou shalt be saved from the sin consequentupon killing me. It doth not behove thee not to kill me,who am exercised with grief, without my lord, snatched awayfrom him and reduced to such a (pitiable) plight. O lordof men, I cannot live long without that highly intelligentlord of monkeys, having an elephantine gait and wearing anexcellent golden garland.\" Thus accosted, the high-souledlord consoling Tārā, spake unto her the followingwell-meaning words.—\"Do thou not lose thyself, O wife of a hero.This whole world of creation is being guided by God'sdispensation. And by Him is administered misery orhappiness as people say. These three worlds cannot neglect Hisdispensations and are entirely subject to Him. Thy sonshall attain to the heir apparentship of the throne and thoushalt enjoy excellent joy therefrom. This hath been decreedby the Almighty. Wives of heroes do never relent.\" Beingthus consoled by the high-souled (Rāma) gifted with prowess,and the slayer of foes, Tārā, the wife of a heroic husband,and wearing a graceful garment, ceased bewailing."

It therefore behoveth ye toperform the after ceremonies. Ye have satisfied the worldlypractice with a profuse discharge of tears. It is not properto delay the performance of appointed actions. Time is theprime cause in this world, and the source of theaccomplishment of actions. And Time it is that leads men to actions.No one is the lord of another person, and no one leads himto actions. People are subject to their actions of previousexistence and Time aids them. Even the Eternal beingcannot withstand the ways of Time. He never decayeth andno one else can withstand the course of Time. It hathno friend, no cause and no one can overcome it. It hathno kinsman, no relation; even it is not subject to itself.The wise can percieve the work of Time. Piety, wealthand desire are all subject to it. Vāli, the lord of monkeys,hath attained to his own true state, reaping the fruits of hisactions, acquired by virtue of his royal accomplishments—namely, forgiveness and charity. The abode of thecelestials, which was conquered by this high-souled one by hisformer piety, hath now been occupied by him after resigninghis body. This is the best course of Time that hath beenattained to by the lord of monkey-herds. No more withlamentations therefore; do thou perform the actions thatare worthy of being performed on this occasion.\" AfterRāma had spoken thus, Lakshmana, the slayer of foes,addressed Sugriva, senseless with grief, with the followingsound words:—\"Sugrivā, do thou perform the funeralceremonies of Vāli along with Tārā and Angada. Dothou collect for cremation many a dry fuel and celestialsandal. Do thou console the unfortunate Angada, who isbeside himself with grief. Do not conduct thyself like anignorant person, for this city is now under thee. Let Angadabring clothes, garlands, scents, clarified butter, oil andother necessary articles. O Tārā, do thou go and bring soona conveyance; for speediness is a special virtue on anoccasion like this. Let the monkeys dress themselves who canconvey this hearse. The powerful and the capable only shallcarry Vāli\". Having thus addressed Sugriva, Lakshmana, theenhancer of Sumitra's joy and the destroyer of foes, stoodbefore his elder brother. And hearing the words ofLakshmana, the counsellor respectfully entered the cave with aview to bring the conveyance. And taking that conveyancecarried by the monkeys and worthy of being carried by theheroes, he issued out again of the cave. It had a celestialthrone and was like unto a war-chariot and had trees andbirds painted on it. It was painted on all sides with thefigures of foot soldiers, had latticed windows and was likeunto the car of the Siddhas—spacious and artistically andstoutly built by artizans with beautiful carvings like unto awooden hill. It was ornamented with excellent ornamentsand beautiful garlands, sprinkled with red sandal and skirtedwith strong ribs. It was covered with flowers andlotus-garlands, crusted with precious clothes and had the colourof the rising Sun. Beholding such a conveyance, Rāmaspake unto Lakshmana, saying—\"Do thou soon conduct thefuneral service of Vāli.\" Thereupon Sugriva, along withAngada, placing Vāli on the conveyance, began to bewail."

  "Āranya, Kishkindhā, and Sundara Kāndam": "And placing the lifeless body of Vāli on it, he covered it withvarious ornaments, garlands, and clothes. Thereat Sugrira,the king of monkeys, ordered for the performance of Vāli'sfuneral rites. \"Let the monkeys go before, scattering manya precious jewel and let the conveyance follow them. Letthe monkeys perform the obsequies of our master with suchgrandeur as befits the riches of the kings on this earth.\"With a view to perform the funeral ceremonies of Vāli, the .counsellors and other monkeys, having lost their king andembraced Angada, proceeded weeping. And other subjectmonkeys followed them. And all other she-monkeys, headedby Tārā, having lost their lord, bewailed, exclaiming againand again—\"O hero, O hero\".—And they, thus bewailingpiteously, followed their lord. And in response to thebewailings of she-monkeys, hills and forests, as if, bewailed on allsides. Monkeys, ranging in the forest, made funeral piles onthe banks of the hill-streams and in solitary watery nooks.Thereupon laying down from their shoulders the conveyance,those foremost of monkeys stationed themselves in a corner,being stricken with grief. And Tārā, beholding her husband'sbody on the conveyance, placed his head on her lap andbewailed, overwhelmed with grief. \"O lord of monkeys! Omy lord! O my dear one! O thou used to luxuries! O thouhaving long arms! O my darling! behold me. Why dostthou not behold these monkeys, racked with sorrow? Oconferrer of honors, thy countenance looks as if beaming withjoy; although thou art dead, and thou appearest as if alive,having the hue of the setting Sun. O monkey, Death himself,under the semblance of Rāma, is attracting thee, who withone shaft in the battle, hath rendered us all widows. O bestof kings, these she-monkeys cannot go by jumping. Dost thounot percive that they have travelled so far on foot? Thosethy wives, having moon-like countenances, have always thywelfare in view. Why dost thou not, O best of monkeys,cast thy looks towards them and Sugriva? O king, thesethy counsellors, thy wives headed by Tārā, and all thesecitizens are bewailing around thee. O slayer of foes, dothou despatch thy counsellors to the city and we shallall enjoy in this forest, excited with amour.\" The othershe-monkeys, worked with sorrow, raised up Tārā bewailingthus being exercised with grief consequent upon the demiseof her husband. Thereupon Angada along with Sugriva,overwhelmed with grief, weeping, placed his Sire's body onthe funeral pile. And putting fire duly, he circumambulated hisSire, bound for a journey for good. Having duly crematedVāli's body,the foremost of monkeys arrived at a river ofauspicious water with a view to perform the watery ceremony.And all these monkeys along with Sugriva and Tārā, placingAngada before them, sprinkled water. And the highlypowerful Kākuthsha, equally aggrieved like Sugriva, being as poorly,cronducted duly the obsequious ceremonies of Vāli. Thereuponcremating Vāli, gifted with unequalled prowess, slain withone shaft of the foremost of Ikswakus, and like unto flamingfire, Sugriva appeared before Rāma who was in the companyof Lakshmana."

And they all, approaching the mighty-armed Rāmaof unwearied actions, stationed themselves with folded handslike unto the great ascetics around the Grand-Father (of thecelestials). Thereupon Hanumān, the son of Marut,resembling a golden hill and having a countenance resemblingthe rising Sun, spake with folded hands, saying:—\"By thyassistance, O Kākuthstha, O lord, this great ancestral kingdomof the highly powerful monkeys, having sharpened teeth,incapable of being acquired by the high-souled ones, hath beenattained to (by Sugriva). Being commanded by thee, healong with his friends, entering this city, shall perform theroyal duties. And being duly bathed he shall worship theeparticularly, with garlands, jewels, scents and oshadhis. Itbehoveth thee to enter this pleasant mountain cave andsatisfy these monkeys by installing (Sugriva on the throne).\"Being thus accosted by Hanumān, the highly intelligentRāghava, skilled in speech and the slayer of foes, replied:—\"O gentle Hanumān, abiding by my Sire's mandate, I shallnot enter a hamlet or a city for these fourteen years. LetSugriva, the foremost of monkeys, enter this magnificentcelestial cave and do ye all instal him speedily on the throne.\"Having thus addressed Hanumān, Rāma spake untoSugriva, saying:—\"Conversant with customs as thou art,do thou instal this generous and heroic Angada, gifted withprowess and honoring customs, as the heir-apparent of thethrone. This brave and eldest son of thy elder brother—Angada, is truly worthy of the heir-apparentship. O gentleone, this month of Srābana, which is the first of those fourmonths which make up the rainy season, hath set in and thisis not the time therefore to institute any enquiry about Sitā.Do thou therefore enter thy auspicious city and I shall live inthis mountain along with Lakshmana. Pleasant indeed isthis mountain cave, spacious, filled with air, water and manylotuses. Thou shalt engage in endeavours to bring about thedestruction of Rāvana, after Kartika sets in. This is notthe proper time, O gentle one, and do thou enter thy owncity. And being installed on the throne do thou enhance thejoy of thy friends.\" Being thus commanded by Rāma,Sugriva, the foremost of monkeys entered the pleasant city ofKishkindhā, reared by Vāli. Encircling that lord of monkeysthousands of them entered the city. Beholding the lord ofmonkeys, the subjects bowed unto him, lowering their headson the ground. Welcoming the subjects and raising themup, the highly powerful Sugriva entered the pleasant innerapartment of his brother. On his entering the city, his friendsinstalled the highly powerful foremost of monkeys—Sugriva,on the throne like unto the celestials placing thethousand-eyed Deity (on the kingdom). The monkeys brought forhim a copper-colored golden umbrella, white chowries, amagnificent golden staff, diverse jewels, various seeds andmedicating drugs, roots and flowers of glomerous figtrees, white clothes, white sandal paste, fragrant garlands,flowers growing in water and on land, celestial sandal andvarious scents, fried grain, gold, Priyangu honey,115clarified butter, curd, tiger-skin, a pair of excellent sandals,gorochana116 and red Arsenic. Carrying all those thingsthere came sixteen maids, highly delighted. Thereuponthose monkeys pleased the foremost of twice-born oneswith jewels clothes and eatables, with a view to instalthat best of monkeys. And these conversant with mantrasthrew clarified butter, sanctified by mantras, into flamingfire burning on a Kuça bed. And placing him on an excellentthrone facing the east, uttering duly mantras in that goldenroom situated on the summit of the picturesque palace andbeautified with magnificent coverlets and garlands, andcollecting pure water from various rivers, sacred places andoceans, those foremost of monkeys kept it in golden jars.Gaya, Gabaksha, Gabaya, Sarava, Gandhamadana, Main da,Divida, Hanumān and Jambuban, installed Sugriva withauspicious horns of a bull and golden jars according to therites prescribed by Sastras and sanctioned by the greatsaints like unto the celestials installing the thousand eyedDeity with pure, fragrant water. Sugriva being installedthus, these high-souled and foremost of monkeys, by hundredsand thousands, began to clatter with delight. Abiding byRāma's words, Sugriva, the lord of monkeys, embracingAngada, conferred on him the heir-apparentship of the throne.And Angada being thus installed, those best of monkeys,highly delighted, adored the high-souled Sugriva, extollinghim again and again. Angada and Sugriva being thusestablished, they all, greatly delighted, praised again andagain the high-souled Rāma and Lakshmana. And the cityof Kishkindhā, filled with stoutly built people and adorned withpennons and flags, appeared beautiful in the mountain cave.Communicating unto the high-souled Rāma the news ofinstallation, the highly powerful lord of monkey hosts (Sugriva)getting back his wife Rumā, regained the kingdom like untothe lord of celestials."

Makingthe above condition with Sugriva, Rāma, the pure-souleddescendant of Raghu, spake unto his humble younger brotherLakshmana, the enhancer of wealth, the following sound words,worthy of being spoken on that occasion—\"O Saumitri, Oslayer of foes, in this pleasant and spacious mountain cavefilled with air, we shall pass the rainy season. O son of a king,this summit of the hill is excellent and picturesque, beautifiedwith white, black and coppery stones, filled with diversemetals and river frogs, covered with diverse trees andpleasant creepers, resounded with the musical notes of variousbirds and cries of peacocks and beautified with variousflowery trees,such as Malati, Kundas, Sindubara,117 Sirisa,118Kadamba, Arjuna,119 and Sarja.120 O son of a king, thispond filled with full blown lotuses shall always be nearour cave. This cave shall be worthy of our habitation, Ogentle one, having its north-eastern part low and the westernpart high. There is, O Saumitri, at the entrance of the cave,a level, beautiful, spacious stone, black like unto collyrium.Behold O my brother, on the north, the summit of the hill,resembling collyrium and a rising cloud. There appears onthe south a beautiful white hill resembling the Kailaça filledwith various metals. Behold before the cave the mudlessstream, flowing towards the east like unto Janhavi121 in theTrikuta122 mountain. This rivulet appears like unto a damselornamented and clothed, being filled with various trees, suchas—Sandal, Tilaka, Sāla, Tamalas, Atimuktas,123 Padmaka,Saralas,124 Asokas, Bāneeras,125 Timidas, Vakulas, Ketakas,Hintalas, Tinicas, Neepas, Vetashas, Kritamalakas growingon her banks. This rivulet resounded with various notesof hundreds of various birds, filled with Chakrabakas attachedto each other, crowded with geese and Sarasas, havingpicturesque banks, and various jewels, is as it were laughingon all sides.

This pleasant and picturesque stream is filled withvarious water fowls and Chakravakas and served by manya saint. Behold there the rows of pleasant sandal treesand those Kukuvas which have grown up as it were like untomental emotion. Picturesque indeed is this place, O slayerof foes, and we shall happily live here, O son of Sumitrā.At no distance, O son of a king, from this place is situatethe pleasant city of Sugriva—Kishkindhā, filled with forests.Hear then, O best of conquerors, the sound of music, andthe clatter of monkeys mingled with the sound of Mridangas.Forsooth is rejoicing Sugriva—the foremost of monkeys,getting back his wife, regaining his kingdom, and attainingto regal splendour.\" Having said this, Rāghava, alongwith Lakshmana, dwelt in that Prasravana hill aboundingin caves and bowers. He did not attain to a best felicityalthough he lived in that pleasant hill filled with manythings. Pondering over the ravishment of his spouse, dearerthan his life, beholding the setting of the Sun in particular,he did not go to sleep, although he laid himself on the bedin the night. His younger brother Lakshmana, equallyaggrieved, spoke unto Kākutstha, thus bewailing being exercisedwith grief and almost beside himself with sorrow, consequentupon Sitā's bereavement, saying:—\"It doth not behovethee to lament thus, being exercised with grief—it is notunknown unto thee that people, thus bewailing do exhaustthemselves by and by. O Rāghava, thou art devoted topious actions and the services of the Deity in this world—and pious, energetic and dost believe in the existence ofGod. Without being persevering thou shalt not be able todestroy in conflict thy enemy—that terrible, willy Rākshasa.Do thou renounce thy grief and take recourse to energy andthou shalt be able to slay that Rākshasa with all his family.What of the destruction of Rāvana, thou art O Kākutstha,capable of uprooting the earth with oceans, forests and hills.Rains have set in and do thou wait for the autumn when thoushalt encompass the destruction of Rāvana with his kingdomand kinsmen. I, too, am exciting thy latent energy like untofire hidden in ashes with oblations. Welcoming theauspicious and well-meaning accents of Lakshmana, Rāghavaagain spake unto him the following affectionate words:—\"O Lakshmana, truly do thy words become thee, affectionate,devoted, truthful and intent on my welfare as thou art.Renouncing this grief standing in the way of all business,I shall call forth, the more, this my energy on the occasionof displaying my prowess. I shall live here, awaiting theautumn and abiding by thy words and awaiting as wellSugriva's pleasure and the clear currents of the rivers.Heroes receiving favours always return them; the ungratefullose the friendship of the honest.\" Considering Rāma's wordsas highly sound and welcoming them therefore, Lakshmana,with folded hands, spake unto Rāma of graceful appearance,displaying his own intelligence—\"O lord of men, I fullyapprove of all thou hast said.

The sky,drinking the liquid contents of the ocean through the rays ofthe Sun, and being enceinte for nine months, is giving birthto showers. Ascending the sky by the steps of clouds, onecan ornament the Sun with garlands of Kutajas and Arjunas.Like unto a wound covered with a torn cloth, the sky isenveloped with cool clouds, coppery with the rays of thesetting Sun, and yellow at another end. The sky, havingmild breezes as its breath, sprinkled with sandal-like eveningrays and covered with yellow clouds, is appearing as it werelike one stricken with amour. The earth, afflicted withperspiration and filled with new water, is emitting forth vapourlike unto Sitā racked with sorrow. Ketaka smelling breezesmay be drunk up in the cavity formed by putting thehands together, like unto cold water discharged off theclouds and mixed with camphor. This hill, having blownArjunas and Ketakas and rid of its enemies like untoSugriva, hath been bathed with showers. These hillocks,having clouds for dark deer-skins, heavy showers for sacredthreads and having caves filled with air, are appearing like somany Brahmins who have finished their studies. The sky,being struck by thunders like unto so many golden lashes,is, as if, groaning under a deep mental agony. Methinks, thelightning, shining by the violet clouds, is appearing like untothe poor Vaidehi at the lap of Rāvana. These quarters,enveloped with clouds and having therefore the Moon andstars hidden, are indeed very pleasant unto those who areunder the influence of Cupid. Behold, O Saumitri, on thesummits of the hill the flowery Kutajas enveloped with thevapour arising out of the earth, gladdened at the approachof the rainy season and exciting my amour who am strickenwith grief. (In this season) the dust is watered, the air issaturated with dews, all the evils of the summer are stopped,the kings no longer proceed on royal marches and thosejourneying in a foreign land return their native homes. TheChakrabākas along with their mates are proceeding, beingdesirous to live in the Mānasa Saravara; and in consequenceof incessant rains, chariots and other conveyances cannotpass along the wayfares. Somewhere hidden, somehere open,the sky, covered with clouds, appears like a vast ocean, beingencircled here and there with hills. There speedily passby the hill streams, being resounded with the cries of peacocks,carrying with the current Sarja and Kadamva flowers andhaving their coppery contents mixed with the metals ofthe mountain. People (in this season) live upon many a sweetrose-apple; and ripe mangoes, of diverse colors, being shakenby the wind, fall on the earth. The clouds, resembling thesummits of a mountain, having lightnings for pennons andcranes for garlands, are muttering like unto infuriatedelephants in a field of battle. The forest-lands, having theirgreen pastures emerged in water, with peacocks dancing allaround with joy and clouds discharging their watery volumesincessantly, are appearing more graceful in the evening.(In this season) clouds, surrounded by cranes and heavilyladen with water, are constantly moving, sometimes restingon the high summits of the mountains and emitting amuttering sound. And rows of cranes, fond of clouds, risingup in the sky, delighted and moved by the wind, areappearing like a garland of white lotuses, spread along the welkin.And the earth, covered with green grass and variegatedwith newly born insects, is appearing like a damsel clothedwith a white blanket spotted here and there with lac.(In this part of the year) sleep is gradually overcoming thegreat God Nārāyana, the river is flowing speedily towardsthe ocean, the delghted cranes are approaching the cloudsand the damsels are proceeding towards their lovers. Thepeacocks are dancing at the forest skirts, the Kadamva treesare covered with flowers, the bulls have become attachedunto kine and the earth has become charming with corns andforests. The rivers are flowing by; the clouds aredischarging waters; the infuriated elephants are emitting terribleroars; the forest-lands are growing more charming; persons,separated from their wives, are growing more anxious; thepeacocks are dancing with delight and the monkeys aregreatly comforted for Sugriva's attaining to the kingdom.By the fountains in the forests, the infuriated elephantsdelighted with the fragrance of the Ketaka flowers andmaddened with the noise of the water falls, are emitting terribleroars along with the peacocks. The black bees, resorting tothe branches of the Kadamba trees and overwhelmed withshowers, are, as if, slowly discharging their temporal juice—namely the honey of flowers collected by them ere while.The branches of rose-apple trees containing enough of fruitslike unto a collection of char coal are so appearing as if theblack bees are drinking the juice thereof. The dense clouds,ornamented with pennon-like lightnings and emitting terribleroars, are appearing like so many elephants, mad after fighting.The infuriated lord of elephants, following in the track andranging in the hills and forests, hearing the muttering of cloudsand taking it for the uproar of another elephant, has turnedback, with a view to enter into conflict with him. Somewherethe bees are humming, somewhere the peacocks are dancing—somewhere are ranging the infuriated elephants—and inthis way the forest-land has assumed diverse appearances.It appears like unto a drinking-place,covered with Kadambas,Sarjas, Arjunas and lotuses growing on land, filled withwater resembling honey and with the dance and criesof mad peacocks. The birds, having their wings discolored,being wet with water, delighted and thirsty, are drinking thedrops of clear water falling on leaves and discharged by theLord of celestials.126 The sonorous humming of the bees, beingaccompanied by the gutteral sound of the frogs and themutterings of the clouds, resembling the sound of Mridangas,an organised music, as if, hath begun in the forest. Sometimesdancing, sometimes setting up loud cries, sometimes placingthemselves against the tops of the trees, the peacocks, havingbeautifully ornamented exteriors, have commenced musicin the forest. And rising from their perpetual sleep by themuttering of clouds, the frogs, assuming various shapes andmaking diverse sounds, are setting up cries being distressedwith new watery showers. The rivers, carrying Chakrabākasas their breast and leaving behind their old banks, areapproaching, being excited, their own lord with various new presents.Clouds, big with new waters coming in contact with violetones are appearing as such; and sometimes, touching thehills burnt by forest-fire, are appearing like deep-rootedhills. The elephants are ranging in this charmingforest-land, carrying the fragrance of Neepas and Arjunas, havingits green swards filled with Indragopas127 and with delighted,peacocks dancing all around. The black bees, delighted,are drinking honey, embracing the shower-distressed and newfilaments of the lotuses and Kadamva flowers. (In thisseason) the elephants are infuriated, the bulls are delighted,the lions have grown more powerful, the hills are charming—the kings are devoid of all active pursuits, and the Lordof celestials is engaged in sport with clouds. The cloudsranging in the welkin and discharging heavy showers, areroaring like unto ocean; and the rivers, ponds and pools aredeluging the earth with their watery contents. (In thisseason) heavy showers set in—the wind bloweth mightily andthe rivers breaking down their banks flow quickly blockadingthe wayfares. The mountains are, as if, displaying their ownbeauty and grace being as it were bathed by the cloud-likejars, conferred by the lord of celestials and brought by thewind like unto a king sprinkled by men. The sky is envelopedwith clouds and neither the sun nor the stars can be seen—the earth is satisfied with new showers—and the quartersbeing covered with darkness cannot be seen. The highsummits, of the mountains, being washed by showers andbeautified by far-stretching waterfalls resembling pearls, areappearing more graceful. The heavy mountain waterfalls,losening the rocks and stretching over the caves filled withthe cries of peacocks, are appearing like a pearl-necklace.And the quick streaming waterfalls, of the mountains,washing the summits of the hills, and resembling the pearls, arebeing deposited in the cave at the foot. And watery dropsresembling the pearls of the necklaces used by celestialdamsels are pouring on all sides. The setting of the Sun isannounced by the birds taking to their nests, lotuses growingpale and Mālatis blossoming. The royal marches are allstopped, and the soldiers, who have already marched are waiting inthe way—hostility and wayfares have been equally blockadedby water. This month of Bhādra is the time ofstudying for those Brahmins, who chant Sāma Vedas. Havingroofed all his houses and stored up his food, Bharata, theking of Koçala hath set upon the performance of Asharasacrifices. The river Saraju is now brimful with water.Seeing me return as if Ayodhya herself is making a delightfulnoise. Clearly manifest are now all the signs of the rainyseason and Sugriva, rid of his enemies, established on thevast kingdom, and regaining his wives, hath attained to bestfelicity. And I am, O Lakshmana, waning everyday like untothe banks of a river, being separated from my spouse anddeprived of my vast kingdom. Immense is my grief,inaccessible is this rainy season and mighty is my enemy,Rāvana; methinks it is impossible for me to bring aboutthe discomfiture of my foe. Owing to the unfitness of theseason (for marching against my foe) and the wayfares beinginacessible, I cannot possibly request Sugriva (to march)although he is prepared to abide by my mandate. Moreoverafter a good deal of affliction he has regained his wives,and my service is of very great difficulty; so I do not wishto request that monkey-chief now. Forsooth, shall Sugrivathink of the benefits (he has received from me) after enjoyingrest for sometime, when the time for action shall arrive.Therefore I shall, O Lakshmana, live here, awaiting thepleasure of Sugriva and the clear currents of the rivers (theautumn). Heroes receiving benefits, do always return them.The ungrateful lose the good wishes of the great ones.\" Beingthus accosted, Lakshmana, with folded hands, respectinghighly his words, spake unto the graceful Rāma, pointingout his own welfare. \"Forsooth shall that lord of monkeyscarry out all thy wishes. Do thou therefore spend here therainy season, awaiting the autumn.\""

  "Āranya, Kishkindhā, and Sundara Kāndam": "Beholding the clear welkin, void of clouds andlightnings, filled with Sarasas and sprinkled with the charming raysof the Moon, Hanumān, the son of Marut, versed in religiouslore and political economy, and conversant with effects properto the time or season, approaching the Lord of monkeys,addressed him with various sound, reasonable and pleasantwords, well-meaning, true and teaching the means ofacquiring forgiveness, piety and wealth. Acquiring richesSugriva hath grown careless for the collection ofrighteousness and wealth, is following the track of the vicious, and isaddicted to the satisfaction of sensual appetites—having all hisactions stopped and desires attained—and given to enjoymentswith damsels. Having attained all his desires and wishes,his own wife and the much-desired-for Tārā, Sugriva issporting with them, day and night, without any affliction, likeunto the Lord of celestials with Gandharbas and Apsarās.Placing all the royal affairs at the hands of the counsellors,without looking to them, and confiding fully in their abilitieshe is living like one under the influence of passions—\"Thouhast attained thy kingdom, fame, and thy vast ancestralwealth. It now behoveth thee to perform thy duties by thyfriends. Truly doth his kingdom, fame and prowess increasewho is cognizant of the seasonableness of time and dothgood to his friends. O king, truly doth he attain to a vastkingdom, who hath the same wealth, soldiery and body withhis friends. It becometh thee, therefore, who art crowned witha good character, and who dost wend a blameless track, towork out thy friend's well-being (as promised by thee). Hewho doth not engage in the service of his friends renouncingall business, becometh void of all energy and involved inunnecessary troubles. And he, who engageth in his friend'sservice after the proper season is over, does nothing to hiswell-being, though he performs a great thing. O slayer offoes, soon shall the time for performing thy friend's service, beover; do thou therefore encompass Rāghava's good, namelythe searching out of Vaidehi. O king, Rāma, conversantwith the seasonableness of time and wise as he is, is notinforming thee of it, though the proper time is past; andthough he is in hurry, he is waiting for thee. Rāghavaas well as Lakshmana, who are the instruments of thyattaining to this vast kingdom, and thy friends for so longa time, are persons of incomparable prowess by virtue oftheir unequalled accomplishments. He hath alreadyperformed thy service, and it behoveth thee now, O lordof monkeys, to command the foremost of monkeys to engagein his service. To engage, out of season, in a service, uncalledfor, is not blameable; but to defer the performance of anaction in proper time after promising is indeed an object ofcensure. O lord of monkeys, thou dost engage even in theservice of one who doth thee no good, then why shalt thounot engage in the benefit of Rāma who hath favoured theeby encompassing the destruction (of Vāli) and securing for theethy kingdom? O lord of monkeys and bears, truly thou artgifted with prowess and strength, why dost thou not preparethyself for satisfying Daçarathee's commands? Daçaratheehimself is capable of subduing the celestials, Asuras and greatserpents—he is simply awaiting the fulfilment of thy promise.He hath performed a great service at the risk of his life—weshall therefore find out Vaidehi whether she is in this earthor in the welkin. Even the celestials, Dānavas, Gandharbas,Asuras, Marutas, Yakshas are afraid of him in thebattlefield—what of the insignificant Rākshasas. O lord ofmonkeys, it therefore behoveth thee to do good by allmeans unto the powerful Rāma, who benefitted thee before.O lord of monkeys, who is there amongst us, who shallnot at thy command proceed unto water, sky or the regionunder the earth? O blameless one, there are more thanone koti of invincible monkeys under thee, do thoucommand, who shall proceed and to what quarter?\" Hearingthese words of Hanumān, said on a very proper occasion,the intelligent Sugriva, made up his mind for a worthyend. Thereupon the highly intelligent Sugriva orderedthe ever active Neela, to collect soldiers from variousquarters. \"Do thou so arrange as all my hosts and soldierswith their commanders soon come here. Do thou soon bringhere at my behest all the energetic and quick-coursingmonkeys and commanders spreading their conquests to theend of the earth. (After their arrival) do thou thyselfinspect and count all those monkeys. He who shall notreach here within fifteen days shall be punished with the lossof his life. There is no need of scrutinizing my orders.Abiding by my order, do thou see along with Angada allthe elderly monkeys.\" Having thus arranged, that best ofmonkeys entered the inner apartment."

  "Āranya, Kishkindhā, and Sundara Kāndam": "Sugriva having entered his palace, and the sky beingcleared of the clouds, Rāma, racked with grief, passing therainy season and beholding the yellow welkin, the clear discof the Moon, the autumnal night sprinkled with the rays ofthe Moon, the amour-stricken lord of monkeys, theravishment of the daughter of Janaka, and the seasonwell-nigh expired, became overwhelmed with sorrow andsenseless. And regaining his sense after sometime, thehighly intelligent king—Rāghava began to think of Vaidehialthough always present in his mind. And beholdingthe clear sky void of lightnings and clouds and filled withthe noise of Sārasas, Rāghava began to lament piteously,stationing himself on the summit of the hill ornamented withmetals of golden hue. And beholding the autumnal skyhe engaged in the meditation of his beloved spouse. Howshall that Sārasa-voiced damsel be pleased to-day, who, whilesporting in the hermitage, used to warble like Sārasas, toinvite them. Beholding Asana trees, as if covered with goldenflowers and not beholding me how shall that damsel bepleased? How that exquisitely fine damsel having a sweetvoice shall be pleased to-day, who used formerly to awakeat the sounds of the drakes? Hearing the noise of hercompanions—Chakrabākas, how shall that one, ofexpansive eyes resembling lotuses, live? Without her having theeyes of a fawn, I do not attain to felicity to-day, ranging atlarge by ponds, streams, pools and in forests and woods.Forsooth shall Cupid excited by the approach of the autumn,distress her the more on account of my separation and herpersonal charms.\" Thus bewailed that best son of a king likeunto the bird Sāranga soliciting water from the lord ofcelestials. And the graceful Lakshmana, returning from thepicturesque mountain-summits where he had sojourned in questof fruits, beheld his elder brother. And beholding in thatlonely forest his brother, racked with anxious thoughts hard tobear and almost beside himself (with grief) the high-mindedSaumitri, prompted by his brother's grief, spoke unto himvery poorly, saying:—\"O worshipful one, what hast thouperpetrated by placing thyself under the control of passionsand defeating thy manliness? Thy deep and devoutmeditation hath been purloined by thy grief; and it is by religiouscontemplation that thy grief shall be terminated now. Obrother, after going through the ceremonies of bathing andso forth, and acquiring peace, do thou bring all thy timeunder thy control by virtue of the concentration of soul; andbeing of unmitigated strength do thou resort to power andhelp, the key-notes for the accomplishment of thy great object.O lord of men, Jānaki, husbanded by thee, is not capable ofbeing easily possessed by others. O hero who getting at aflame of fire, doth not burn himself?\" Thereupon Rāmaspoke unto Lakshmana, gifted with royal marks,addressing him with natural and resolute words and saying:—\"What thou hast said, is sound, well-meaning, sanctioned bypolity and speaks of piety, wealth and forgiveness. Itshould therefore, without the least doubt, be performed by me.It behoveth me to engage in contemplation about the eternaltruth regarding the Deity and in ascetic observances. Orelse O Prince, it is not proper to think of the fruits of adifficult, highly developed and energetic action.\" Thereuponthinking of Maithelee, having eyes resembling lotus-petals,Rāma spoke unto Lakshmana with a dried countenance.\"Having satisfied the earth with a profuse discharge ofwater, produced crops and thus, finished his work, thethousand eyed Deity is sitting silent. O son of a king,the clouds, muttering a long and deep sound and approachingthe hills and trees, are calmed having discharged their liquidcontents. Having made the ten quarters dark blue, theclouds, resembling blue lotuses, have become calm, like untoelephants without temporal juice. O gentle one, high galesaccompanied with rains, big with water and fragrant withKutaja and Arjuna flowers being driven before hitherand thither, have now become silent O innocentLakshmana, the sounds of clouds, elephants, peacocks, andfountains, have been all stopped. Hills, having variegatedsummits, being washed by dense clouds and thus free fromdirt and impurities, do appear elegant being sprinkled bythe rays of the Moon. Forsooth hath the autumn set in,dividing its grace in the branches of Saptachada trees, inthe rays of the Sun and Moon with stars and in the gaits ofthe excellent elephants. Surely hath the autumnal graceresorted to many things. And it hath appeared moreprofusely in the lotuses blossomed by the first rays of the Sun.Scented sweet with the flower of Saptachada trees, borowingthe musical notes of bees, following the wind and subduingthe pride of infuriated elephants, the autumn is appearingvery elegant. The swans are playing with Chakrabakashaving splendidly spacious wings, fond of cupid, crusted withthe filaments of lotuses, and arriving at the banks of therivers. The autumnal grace is appearing more elegantbeing divided in infuriated elephants, in proud kine, and instreams of clear currents. Beholding the sky divested ofclouds, without manifesting the beauty of their tailsand renouncing their attachment unto their belovedmates, amusements and beauty, the peacocks are as if allengaged in meditation in the forest. The forest-landsare as if a-blaze with many a sweet-scented picturesquePriyaka trees, having a golden hue and their topslowered down with the weight of flowers. The gaits, ofthe elephants rendered idle with a profuse dischargeof temporal juice, fond of forests and water lilies,smelling the fragrance of the flowers of Saptachhada treesand accompanied by their mates, have become slow. Thesky is clear like unto a sword—the streams have becomeof feeble currents—the wind, cool and scented with thefragrance of white esculent waterlilies, is blowing—and quartershave become devoid of darkness. The mud has beendried up by the rays of the Sun and the earth is filledwith dust—this is the time for preparation for inimicalkings (to enter into conflict). The bulls, having theirbeauty enhanced by the autumn, and their body coveredwith dust, delighted, infuriated and hence desirous ofentering into skirmish, have been setting up terribleroars in the midst of kine. The she-elephants, movingslowly, fond, passionate and accompanied by other members,have been following their passionate mates, in the forest,embracing them. Leaving behind their excellentornaments—the tails, the peacocks, getting at the banks of therivers, have been going away poorly and with depressedhearts as if being remonstrated with by the Sārasas. Havingterrified the Kārandavas and Chakrabakas with their mightyroars, the elephants, having cleft trunks and being agitatedagain and again, have been drinking water in the pondsfilled with full blown lotuses. The drakes have been jumpingdelightedly into the rivers, mudless, covered with sands, fullof clear water, filled with kine and resounded with the notesof Sārasas. Now hath stopped the noise of rivers, clouds,fountains, water, the high winds, the peacocks and themirthless frogs. And venomous snakes of vareiagated colors,having lived for a pretty long time during the rainswithout food, have on the approach of the autumn, comeout of their dens, hungry, in quest of their prey. Thered-dyed evening hath renounced the welkin, beingdelighted at the touch of the rays of the Moon and openinga little her eyes—the stars. Having the rising Moon forher elegant countenance, the stars for her excellentopen eyes and the rays for a piece of white garment,the night appeareth like a damsel wearing a white cloth.Having fed on ripe white rice, the excellent rows ofdelighted Sārasas are flying quickly up to the sky like untoa well-strung garland shaken by the wind. The water, of thelake filled with sleeping drakes and water lilies, is appearinglike the sky in the night, devoid of clouds and filled withthe Full Moon and stars. The ponds, having the drakesscattering hither and thither for their girdles andengarlanded with full blown lotuses and water lilies, areappearing like so many damsels ornamented with diverseornaments. The sound set up by the wind in the dawnlike unto that of a pipe accompanied by the music of atrumpet, being mixed with the noise of the caves andbulls are as if multiplying each other. The banks ofthe rivers are being dressed by the newly blossomedflowers shaken by the mild breezes and Kāças. like unto clean,washed silken clothes. The black bees, bold, given todrinking honey, rendered yellow with the filaments of lotusesand Asana flowers, delighted and accompanied by their matesare following the wind in the forest. The clear water, theblossoming flowers, the noise of Craunchas, the ripewhite rice, the mild breezes, the clear Moon announcethe approach of the Autumn—the removers of the rains. Therivers, having fishes for their girdles, have become ofslackened course like unto damsels moving slowly in the dawnbeing enjoyed by their husbands. The mouths of the rivers,filled with Chakrabākas, covered with aquatic plants andclothed with Kāças are appearing like unto the countenancesof damsels pasted with yellow pigments. The most powerfulCupid hath taken up his terrible bow in this forest filled withAsana flowers appearing like unto arrows and the hum ofdelighted bees. Having satisfied the people with a profusedischarge of water, filled the rivers and pools and covered theearth with crops, the clouds have disappeared renouncing thesky. The rivers in this season of autumn have been graduallyshowing their banks. O thou of excellent looks, the ponds (inthis season) appear exquisitely fine, being filled with Kurarabirds and Chakrabākas. O son of king, this is the time ofpreparation for inimical kings, desirous of defeating oneanother. O son of a king, this is the best time for royalmarches, but I do not find Sugriva preparing himself for thatend. There appear on the summits of the hills flowersAsanas, Saptaparnas, Kavidāras, Bandhugeebas, and Tamālās.Behold, O Lakshmana, the banks of the rivers filled withswans, Sārasas, Chakrabākas and Kuraras. Stricken asI am with grief, these four months, the season of rains,appeared unto me like a hundred year, not beholding Sitā.Like unto Chakrabākas following their mates, Sitā, takingthe terrible forest of Dandaka for a picturesque garden, usedto follow me there. O Lakshmana, Sugriva, is not inclinedto show any commiseration towards me, who am separatedfrom my beloved spouse, deprived of my kingdom, banishedand striken with sorrow. Regarding me as one without anyto back him, deprived of his kingdom, insulted by Rāvana,wretched, of a distant land, under the influence of amour andtherefore seeking his help, (Sugriva hath not felt pityfor me). O subduer of foes, O thou of excellent looks, forthese reasons, I have been insulted by that vicious-souledking of monkeys—Sugriva. Having appointed the time toinstitute enquiries about Sitā, that wicked-minded one hathnow forgot it on the accession of his new dignity. Do thoutherefore repair to Kishkindhā and speak of me unto thatstupid lord of monkeys—Sugriva, addicted to ruralenjoyments. And do thou tell him—'He, who breaks his promisemade unto a powerful benefactor who solicits his favour, isregarded by people as vile. He is a true hero and anexcellent person who verifies his words whether good or bad.Ungrateful they are who do not, after attaining their ends,engage in the service of those of their friends who have notaccomplished their objects; even those living on raw fleshdo not feed on their gore after their death'. And ask him ifhe wishes to behold in battle-field the golden bow resemblinga lightning. And ask him more, if he wishes to hear theterrible twang of my bow resembling the noise of thunder,when I am enraged in battle. O hero, O son of a king, whenapprised of my prowess assisted by thee, will he notrecapitulate in his mind (that he may be destroyed by us like untoVāli)? O conqueror of enemies' cities, does not that lord ofmonkeys, after accomplishing his object, think of the conditionsunder which our friendship was contracted? Does not thatlord of monkeys think that he has spent four months inenjoyments, having promised and appointed the season, afterrains, (for making) enquiries about Sitā\"? Does not Sugrivafeel pity for us, who are racked with sorrow, being addictedto drinking with friends and counsellors? Do thou go, Ohero, O thou of mighty strength and relate unto Sugrivathese my angry words. 'O Sugriva, do not neglect thypromise and wend the way trodden by Vāli. I killed Vālionly with my shaft in the battle-field; but if thou dost deviatefrom the path of truth I shall destroy thee along with thykinsmen and relatives.' O thou best of men, do thou speedilyrelate unto him all those benefits which we shall reap by hisactions, for the proper season is well-nigh past. O best ofmonkeys, do thou carry out thy promise remembering theeternal existence of virtue. Do thou not behold the spiritof Vāli in the abode of Death, being killed by the shaftdischarged by me.\" Beholding his elder brother thus enragedand bewailing, the fiery-spirited Lakshmana, the best of men,became enraged with Sugriva."

  "Āranya, Kishkindhā, and Sundara Kāndam": "Lakshmana again addressed his high-minded elderbrother, the son of a king, influenced by passion, strickenwith grief, and poorly, with the following words. \"Thatmonkey shall not follow the actions of the pious, shall notthink of the great fruit (the accession of kingdom) reapedby our friendship; he shall not enjoy the riches of themonkey-kingdom because he has not the right understandingto make good his promise. Owing to the wane of hisunderstanding in consequence of thy favour he is addicted to ruralenjoyments and hath forgot to return thy benefits. O hero,killed let him espy his elder brother Vāli. It is not properto confer kingdom upon that wicked-minded one. I amunable to bear the outburst of my ire—forsooth shall Ikill to-day—that liar Sugriva. May the son of Vāli with otherprincipal monkeys engage in quest of that daughtera king.\" Beholding him rise up from the seat withbow in his hand and greatly wrought up with anger andhearing him thus announce his intention about the destructionof Sugriva, Rāma, the slayer of foes, spake unto him thefollowing humble words worthy of being spoken on thatoccasion. \"Persons like thee on this earth do not perpetratethe crime of destroying their friends. He is truly a greathero and an excellent person who subdues anger by hisright understanding, O Lakshmana, it is not proper for theeto bring about the destruction of thy friend; do thoufollow thy former friendship and good feelings. Avoidingharsh words do thou address Sugriva, who has violatedhis promise, with soothing words.\" Being thus dulycounselled by his elder brother, that best of men, the heroicLakshmana—the slayer of foes, entered the city. Thereuponthe highly intelligent Lakshmana of right understanding,and ever intent upon the welfare of his brother, taking upa bow like unto Indra's, resembling the summit of a hilland terrible as Death himself, entered, wrought up with ire, theabode of the king of monkeys like the hill Mandāra.Intelligent like Vrihaspati and ever abiding by his elder brother'sbehest, Lakshmana, revolving in his mind what he shouldsay as well as Sugriva's answers, and enveloped with thefire of anger arising from the excitement of his brother'samour, and therefore displeased, proceeded quick as air.And on he proceeded, felling down by his velocity, Sāla,Tāla, and Asvakarna trees, throwing aside the mountainsummits and other trees, breaking rocks into pieces withhis feet and striding very quickly like unto a fleet-coursingelephant. And that best of Ikshwākus, beheld that splendidcity of the king of monkeys, hard to enter, surrounded bymonkey-herds, and mountains. And having his lips swollenwith anger for Sugriva, Lakshmana beheld the terriblemonkeys walking outside the city. Beholding that best ofmen—Lakshmana, the monkeys resembling elephants enteredthe mountainous stronghold and took up the summits of thehill and huge trees. And observing them armed, Lakshmanawas doubly inflamed with anger like unto fire kindled withfuels. And beholding Lakshmana, highly enraged, terribleas Death himself at the time of dissolution, the monkeysstricken with fear, fled away, by hundreds, into variousquarters. Thereat those foremost of monkeys, entering thepalace of Sugriva, communicated unto him, Lakshmana's ireand approach. That amorous chief of monkeys, attachedunto Tārā, paid no heed to the words of those foremost ofmonkeys. Thereupon those terrible monkeys, resemblinghills, elephants and clouds, went out of the city beingcommanded by the minister. Some of them had sharpenedteeth and nails, some were grim-visaged, some had teethlike those of tigers, some had the strength of ten elephants,some had the strength of a hundred elephants and somehad that of a thousand elephants. Thereupon Lakshmana,angry, espied the city of Kishkindhdā hard to enter andsurrounded by mighty monkeys with trees in theirhands. And getting over the ditch around the city walls,those terrible-looking monkeys stationed themselves openly.And meditating upon Sugriva's error and his brother'sinterest, the self-controlled Lakshmana, heroic, proceededonwards. Sighing hot and hard, that best of men—Lakshmana,with reddened eyes appeared like unto smoky fire. Heappeared like unto a terrible serpent of five mouths, having thetop of the arow for his tongue, the bow for his expanded hoodand his own prowess for the poison. Beholding him like theflaming fire of dissolution and enraged lord of serpents,Angada, out of fear, became exceedingly sorry. Thereuponthe far-famed Lakshmana, having his eyes reddened withire, spoke unto Angada, saying\"—O child, do thou informSugriva of my arrival. O conqueror of foes, do thou tell him:—Lakshmana, the younger brother of Rāma, being strickenwith grief on account of his brother's disaster, hath cometo thee and is waiting at the gate. If it pleaseth thee, dothou make good thy promise.' Saying these words do thouspeedily return, O my child, O conqueror of foes.\" HearingLakshmana's words, Angada, overwhelmed with grief,aproaching his uncle said—'Saumitree hath arrived here.' Beinggreatly agitated with harsh words, Angada, with a pale andpoorly countenance issued out speedily and approaching,touched first the king's feet and afterwards with reverence Rumā'sfeet. That one of exceeding prowess first touched the feetof his uncle then saluted again his mother and afterwardstouching the feet of Rumā related unto them every thingin full. That monkey, possessed by amour and underthe influence of liquor, being asleep could not hear (whatAngada had said). Beholding Lakshmana highly enraged, themonkeys, possessed by fear, began to make noise as theywere welcoming him. They, approaching Lakshmana began toset up a terrible roar like unto thunder and resemblingthe uproar of lions and the noise of water-falls. By thatterrible sound awoke that monkey-chief, having copperyeyes, agitated, adorned with garlands and possessed byliquor. Hearing the words of Angada, the two counsellors ofSugriva, intelligent and of magnificent looks, along with him,approached that lord of monkeys. And those two ministersYaksha and Pravaba, to give him proper counsels, informed(that monkey-chief) of the arrival of Lakshmana. SatisfyingSugriva with words pointing out his welfare, they sitting byhim, spake unto that lord of wind resembling the king ofcelestials, saying:—\"Of those two great and truthful brothersRāma and Lakshmana, who are born as men, worthy ofattaining to kingdom and who have gained for thee thy kingdom,Lakshmana, with a bow in his hand, is waiting at thy gate.And afraid of whom, the monkeys, trembling, are setting upterrible roars. That Lakshmana, Rāghava's brother, havingwords for his charioteer, and perseverance for his chariot,hath approached thee at his brother's command. Oblameless king, by that Lakshmana—Tārā's darling, Angadahath been despatched unto thee. O king, of monkeys,that highly powerful one, having his eyes full of ire, iswaiting at thy gate, as if burning down with his eyes all themonkeys. O king, along with thy children and friends do thourepair unto him speedily and bowing unto him with thyhead down do thou pacify his wrath. And do thou, O king,with a composed heart, perform what the virtuous-souledRāma hath ordered thee to do and thus fulfil thy promise."

  "Āranya, Kishkindhā, and Sundara Kāndam": "Hearing the words of Angada as well as of Lakshmana' swrath, the self-controlled Sugriva along with his counsellors,left his seat. Ascertaining the weight and lightness of thepresent occasion, that one, expert in counsels and abidingby their advice spake unto the expert counsellors, saying:—\"Ihave not done him any wrong, nor have I spoken unto him anyimproper word. I do not know why Rāghaya's brotherLakshmana hath become offended with me. Lakshmana hath beenfalsely apprised of my imaginary weakness by my enemies,always looking to my dark sides. It behoveth ye all, to ascertainnow speedily according to your knowledge and rightunderstanding (the cause of Lakshmana's wrath). I do not fearLakshmana or Rāghava; but friends enraged without anycause do invariably produce fear. It is easy to contractfriendship but very difficult to sustain it; for owing to thefickleness of our minds, a very slight cause brings aboutseparation. I have not done him any good proportionate towhat the high-souled Rāma had done for me; and it is forthis reason that I am afraid of him.\" Being thus addressedby Sugriva—Hanumān, the foremost of monkey-counsellors,spoke, according to his own understanding, saying:—\"It isno wonder, O lord of monkeys, that thou hast not forgotthe unexpected benefit, (thou hadst received at the hands ofRāma). To encompass thy well-being, Vāli, powerful as theLord of celestials, was fearlessly destroyed by the heroicRāghava. There is not the least doubt, that Rāghava, out oflove, is enraged with thee, and hath despatched his youngerbrother Lakshmana, the enhancer of prosperity. O thouforemost of those conversant with time, the auspicious autumn,green with Saptachhada flowers, hath set in and thou,given up to enjoyments, doth not percieve it. The sky,having the clouds removed, is full of clear stars and planets.The quarters, the ponds and rivers are all clear. O bestof monkeys, finding thee forgetful, Lakshmana hath comehere to inform thee that the proper time hath arrived. Dothou patiently hear all these harsh words of the high-souledRāma, racked with sorrow and separated from his spouse,which Lakshmana, shall relate unto thee. Thou hast actedimproperly towards him, and I do not find any thing tendingto thy welfare but thy satisfying Lakshmana with foldedhands. The kings should be addressed with auspicious wordsby their counsellors always ministering unto them propercounsels. And it is for this reason, I am addressing thee withthese sound words. Rāghava, taking up his bow, whileenraged, can bring under subjection the entire world, inhabitedby the celestials, Asuras and Gandharbas. Rememberinghis former service, it doth not behove thee, grateful as thouart, to excite his wrath, who should be pleased again.Bowing unto him, with thy children and friends, do thou, O king,satisfying thy promise, seek his shelter like unto a wifeplacing herself under the control of her husband. O lord ofmonkeys, it doth not behove thee, to neglect even in thought,the behests of Rāma and his younger brother; for thou artfully aware of the prowess of Rāghava like unto the lord ofcelestials, and passing human power."

  "Āranya, Kishkindhā, and Sundara Kāndam": "Thereupon, Lakshmana, the slayer of foes,commanded, entered, at the behest of Rāma, the pleasant city ofKishkindhā situated in the centre of caves. BeholdingLakshmana, the highly powerful monkeys, having hugepersons and waiting at the gate, stood all with folded hands.And seeing Daçaratha's son highly enraged and sighing againand again, the monkeys stood silent and did not interrupthim. The graceful Lakshmana espied that huge picturesqueand celestial cave adorned with jewels and flowery gardens.It was filled with palatial buildings, various jewels andflowery trees, producing at all times wished-for fruits. It wasbeautified with good-looking monkeys—children of thecelestials and Gandharbas wearing celestial garlands andclothes and assuming shapes at will. It was fragrant with thesweet smell of sandal wood, Aguru and lotuses and itshighways were equally fragrant with the smell of honey. AndLakshmana beheld there many spacious buildings like untothe hills Vindhya and Meru and rivers of clear water. And healso surveyed the picturesque dwellings of Angada, Mainda,Divida, Gavaya, Gabaksha, Gaja, Sarava, Vidhutmali, Sampāti,Suryaksha, Hanumān, Beerabahu, Subahu, Nala, Kumuda,Sushena, Tārā, Jambabān, Dadhibaktra, Neela, Sunetra andSupātala like unto sable clouds adorned with excellentgarlands, filled with rice and jewels and beautiful damsels.Unobstructed the highly powerful Saumitri entered thepicturesque abode of Sugriva like unto the Sun entering intoa collection of dense clouds. The abode of this lord ofmonkeys was like unto the palace of the Lord of celestials,ornamented with the tops of white buildings resembling thesummits of the Kailaça hill and flowery trees producing atall times, wished-for fruits; covered with beautiful treeshaving cool shades and bearing celestial fruits and flowersresembling the molten-gold. And that virtuous-souled one,crossing the seven rooms filled with conveyances and seatsbeheld the secret apartment (of that monkey-chief), havingmany a gold and silver bed-steads with excellent coverletsand fine seats. No sooner had he entered the innerapartment than he heard a musical sound, well-measured andaccompanied by the music of the stringed instrument. Andthat highly powerful one beheld in the abode of Sugrivamany a beautiful damsel proud of their youth and beauty,sprung from respectable families, adorned with splendidornaments, engaged in stringing excellent garlands. Andhe observed Sugriva's servants, well fed, contented, nothurry in offering their services and without splendidornaments. Hearing the sounds of women's girdles andtheir Nupurs,128 the graceful Lakshmana became highlyashamed. And highly enraged at the sound of the ornaments,the hero filled all the quarters with the twang of his bow.Lakshmana of mighty-arms stood silent in a nook, thinkingof his improper conduct of entering into (Sugriva's) seraglio,albeit he was wrought up with ire in consequence of Sugriva'sneglecting Rāma's service. Thereupon Sugriva, the lord ofmonkeys, being apprised of Lakshmana's approach by thetwang of his bow and terrified, trembled on his throne,and thought aside:—\"Forsooth hath Saumitri, fond of hisbrother, come, whose approach was announced by Angadabefore. Informed before by Angada of his approach, andmade doubly sure by the twang of the bow, that monkeycame to know of Lakshmana's arrival and turned pale.Thereupon Sugriva, the foremost of monkeys, wroughtup with fear, addressed the fine looking Tārā with thefollowing well-meaning words:—\"O beautiful lady, dostthou know, why hath the mild-natured younger brotherof Rāma, arrived here enraged? O blameless lady,dost thou perceive any cause of the Prince's wrath?Forsooth, that best of men, is not enraged for a slightcause. Considering aright, dost thou speedily informme if I have performed any improper act towards Rāma.O fine lady, do thou approach him in person and pacifyhim with soothing words. Beholding thee, that pure-souledone shall not be worked with ire; great men do never behaveroughly towards the females. Approaching him do thouconsole him and thereafter I shall see that conqueror of foeshaving eyes resembling lotus-petals.\" Thereupon Tārā,with faltering feet and eyes wild with wine, the goldenchains of her zone flowing (about her hips),—graced withauspicious marks, saught Lakshmana's presence withdowncast looks. Beholding Tārā, the queen of the lord ofmonkeys, Lakshmana, the high-souled son of a king,restraining his anger on the approach of a female, stoodwith his head hung down, conducting himself like anascetic. Renouncing modesty under the influence of liquor,and finding the king's son well pleased, Tārā spake untoLakshmana, bold and loving words, in order to console him.\"O son of a king, what is the cause of thy wrath? Whois there who hath not abode by thy commands? Whocan remain without anxiety, beholding fire in a forest filledwith dried trees?\" Hearing the soothing words of Tārā,Lakshmana, undaunted, spoke again, greatly manifesting hisfriendship:—\"O thou intent on thy husband's welfare, dost thounot perceive that thy husband is by and by losing piety andwealth, being addicted to amorous enjoyments? O Tārā,thy husband doth not think of us who are moved with sorrow—but is addicted to sensual enjoyments only, being surroundedby parasites. (Having promised that he would instituteenquiries about Sitā after four months), that lord of monkeyshath well-nigh spent the entire period, being influencedby liquor and addicted to enjoyments along with thee. Forthe attainment of piety and wealth, drinking is not a propercourse. It is by drinking that people lose piety, wealthand desire. He who doth not return the services of hisbenefactor, loseth piety. He who loseth friendship with aqualified friend, loseth wealth. He is the best friend who isgifted with wealth and is truthful; and thy husband hathrelinquished such a friend gifted with these two qualities. And,therefore, he doth not abide by the virtue of preservingfriendship. O thou expert in business, this being the case,do thou advise us as to what we should do.\" Hearing the sweetwords of Lakshmana consonant with piety and wealth,Tārā again addressed him about Rāma's business, yetremaining unaccomplished, with words inspiringconfidence,—\"O son of a king, this is not the time fordisplaying thy wrath; it is not proper to be angry with one'sown friends. O hero, it behoveth thee to put up withthe error of him who hath thy welfare in view. Oprince, who, accomplished with excellent virtues,gets enraged with one of inferior merits? Oprince, who, like thee, an offspring of asceticism, isworked up with ire against the virtue of forgiveness? Iknow the (cause of the) wrath of that heroic monkey's friend.I know the time for action. I know what thou hast donefor us. I know what is due from us to thee. And, Oforemost of men, I also know the irrisistible force of Kāma. Iknow by whom Sugriva has been taken captive, and thathis heart is not now in the work. As thou hast come underthe governance of anger, thy mind has not felt the influence ofdesire. Even a human being that hath conceived love, does notstay for place or time or interest. Do thou forgive that lordof the monkey race, thy brother, influenced by carnality, whois by thee, and who through the urgency of lust, hasbanished shame. Even Maharshis finding delight in religionand asceticism, setting their hearts upon satisfying lust,(ultimately) become fast bound by ignorance. But this is amonkey, volatile by nature, and hath, furthermore, beenenjoying regal state—why should he not act thus? Havingthus said unto Lakshmana of immeasurable intelligencewords fraught with high import, that female monkey, hereyes drooping with languor, again sadly spake in this wisefor the behoof of her husband, \"O foremost of men, althoughSugriva has come under the sway of desire, he hath, to securethy good, ere this issued orders for preparations to be made.And monkeys by hundreds and thousands and kotis,inhabiting various mountains, possessed of exceeding prowess,have already arrived (here). Do thou therefore, Omighty-armed one, come. (Having rushed towards the inner apartment),thou hast not suffered in character. For the good to beholdothers' wives in a friendly spirit, cannot bring onunrighteousness.\" Permitted by Tārā, that long-armed repressor offoes, urged on by (the required) speed, entered the innerapartment. There seated on a superb seat spread with acostly carpet, he found Sugriva resembling the sun himself,his person decked with noble ornaments, of a dignifiedpresence, famous, wearing gay garlands and attire, invinciblelike unto the great Indra. And surrounded by damesadorned with elegant ornaments and wreaths, Sugriva withhis eyes still more reddened in wrath, looked like theDestroyer himself. Then deeply embracing Umā, thelarge-eyed hero of the hue of fine gold, seated on an excellent seat,saw the powerful Saumitri having expansive eyes."

  "Āranya, Kishkindhā, and Sundara Kāndam": "Seeing that foremost of men, Lakshmana, exercised withwrath, as he entered in without let, Sugriva was seizedwith sadness. And seeing Daçaratha's son, wroth, andbreathing hard, and flaming up in energy, and burning inconsequence of the calamity that had overtaken his brother,that chief of monkeys started up, leaving his golden seat,like unto the mighty ornamented standard of the great Indra.And as Sugriva rose up, Umā and the other females roseup, like unto stars appearing in the sky when the full moonhas risen. And with eyes reddened, and his hands folded,the graceful Sugriva came (before Lakshmana) and stoodthere like a mighty Kalpa tree. And the wrathful Lakshmanaspake unto Sugriva stationed among women, having Umāfor his second, and resembling the moon with the stars,saying,—\"The king that is nobly endowed by heredity, andis kind, that hath subdued his senses,and is grateful andtruth-telling, obtains renown in this world. And who is morewicked than that king who, rooted in unrighteousness, makesfalse promises unto friends intent upon his welfare? Hethat speaks a falsehood with reference to a horse, becomesguilty of the deaths of an hundred horses: he committinghimself to a falsehood relative to a cow, reapeth the demeritof slaying a thousand kine; while he that uttereth anuntruth touching a person, destroys self as well as his kindred.That ungrateful wight that, having at first attained benefitat the hands of his friends, doth not requite it, is, O lord ofmonkeys, worthy of being slain by all creatures. Seeingan ingrate wretch, the wrathful Brahmā sang the (previous)sloka, bowed down unto by all the worlds. Do thouunderstand that, O monkey. The pious provide deliverance forthe cow-killer, the wine-biber, the thief, and the violatorof vows; but for the ungrateful person there is nodeliverance whatever. Thou art ignoble and ungrateful and lying,O monkey, since, having been formerly benefitted by Rāma,thou dost not requite his services. Having been benefittedby Rāma, thou, anxious to repay his kindness, shouldstexert thyself in search of Sitā. But, of false promises,thou hast been indulging in gross enjoyments,—nor dothRāma know thee for a serpent, croaking like a frog.129 Asinful wretch and of wicked soul, thou hast obtained thekingdom of the monkeys through the agency of theeminently virtuous, kind and high-souled Rāma. Thou dost notacknowledge the good offices rendered unto thee by thehigh-souled Rāghava; and therefore, slain by means ofsharpened shafts, thou shalt soon see Vāli. The way thathath been wended by the slain Vāli, is not yet narrowed. Dothou, O Sugriva, desist in time: do not walk in the wakeof Vāli. Do not behold the shafts resembling thunder-boltsshot from the bow of that best of the Ikshwākus. Then,attaining happiness, thou shalt pass thy days in peace. Nordo thou mentally neglect Rāma's business.\""

  "Āranya, Kishkindhā, and Sundara Kāndam": "When Sumitrā's son, Lakshmana, had spoken thus,flaming in energy, Tārā of face fair as the moon, said untohim, \"O Lakshmana, thou ought not to speak thus: and thislord of monkeys does not deserve to hear this harsh speechfrom thy lips, in especial. Sugriva is not ungrateful, orcunning, or heartless; nor doth he, O hero, deal in falsehood;nor is he deceitful. Nor hath the heroic monkey, O hero,forgotten the good, incapable of being done by others in battle,that the hero, Rāma, hath done in his behalf. And, Oafflictor of foes, through Rāma's grace, Sugriva hath hereattained fame and the enduring empire of the monkeys, aswell as Umā and myself. Having lain down miserably before,Sugriva, now that he hath attained this supreme happiness,doth not heed his urgent duties, like the ascetic Viçwāmitra.Attached unto Ghritachi, O Lakshmana, the pious and mightyascetic, Viçwāmitra looked upon ten years as one day;and that best of those conversant with time, Viçwāmitra ofmighty energy, did not perceive that the time (for doing acertain act) had arrived. What is to be said of other people?O Lakshmana, it behoveth Rāma to forgive one who hathall the bodily exigencies, who is fatigued, and who is notsatisfied with the pleasures of Kāma. Nor, O Lakshmana,doth it behove thee, without ascertaining the exact import ofthings, to become suddenly subject to wrath, like any inferiorperson. O chief of men, persons endowed with the qualityof goodness, like unto thee, do not suffer themselves to comeunder the sway of passion, without (at first) needfullyrevolving matters. I crave thy favor with concentrated mind,thou that knowest morality. Renounce the mighty griefthat springs from thy ire. This is my conviction that forcompassing Rāma's welfare, Sugriva can resign Umā andmyself, and Angada, and the kingdom and wealth and cornand animals. Slaying that worst of Rākshasas, Sugriva willbring Rāghava with Sitā, like unto the moon accompaniedby Rohini. Without slaying hundreds, of thousands ofKotis, and thirty six Ayutas, thousands, and hundreds ofirrepressible Rākshasas wearing shapes at will, (Rāma) cannot slay Rāvana, by whom Maithili hath been carried away.They are incapable, O Lakshmana, of being slain (by Rāma)in battle, unless he is supported (by others). Rāvana is awily warrior, and hence is the special need of Sugriva.That knowing lord of monkeys, Vāli, had told me all this.I do not know how Rāvana had secured this host: I say whatI had heard from Vāli. For rendering thee assistance, theforemost monkeys have been despatched in order to summonto the conflict numerous principal monkeys. Expectingthese powerful and exceedingly strong ones, for attainingRāghava's end, this lord of monkeys doth not (yet) sally out.Things, O Saumitri, have beforehand been so satisfactorilyarranged by Sugriva, that this very day the mighty one willbe joined with all those monkeys. This very day billionsof bears and thousands of golangulas as well as innumerableKotis of monkeys flaming in energy shall join thee.Therefore, O subduer of enemies, banish thy anger. Seeing this thyface wrought up with wrath, and thy eyes appearing like redsores, the wives of the best of monkeys experience no peace,and they are agitated by the fear that exercised them of late.\""

On his accepting the speech, the lord of monkeyslike a wet cloth cast off from him the fear he had conceivedon account of Lakshmana. Then Sugriva—lord of monkeys—tore away the gaudy and variegated garland on his neck—potent with many a virtue, and became deprived of energy.And that master of all the monkeys, Sugriva, gladdeningLakshmana of dreadful prowess, humbly observed unto him,\"Thou son unto Sumitra, by the favor of Rāma have Ireceived back my lost luck, my fame, and this eternal monarchyof the monkeys. O king's son, who is capable of repayingeven in part an action like that of the divine (Rāma)renowned by means of his own acts? By virtue of nativeenergy, and merely with my help, the righteous Rāghavashall recover Sitā and slay Rāvana to boot. What need ofassistance to him who with a single shaft rived seven gianttrees, a mountain, and the Earth. O Lakshmana, what isthe use of help to him the sounds of whose stretching bowmade the Earth tremble with her mountains? O best of men,when that foremost of men shall set out for slaying his enemy,Rāvana along with those going before him, I will follow him. Ifthrough my confidence, or presuming upon our amity,I have transgressed in any way, (Rāma) ought to excuse hisservant,—for there is no servant that doth not transgress.\"When the high-souled Sugriva had said this, Lakshmanabecame well pleased, and he spake from love,—\"Having, inespecial, thee endeued with humility, my brother, O monarchof monkeys, is every way strong, O Sugriva. Suchis thy strength, O Sugriva, and such thy self-denial, that thouart fully worthy to enjoy the good fortune of the king ofmonkeys. O Sugriva, by thy help, the puissant Rāma shallspeedily slay his foe. Of this there is not the least doubt.O Sugriva, what thou, virtuous, grateful and never turningaway from fight, hast said is fit and proper. What knowingperson, excepting, O foremost of monkeys, thyself and my elderbrother, can speak so? Resembling Rāma himself in strengthand prowess, thou, O chief of monkeys, hast been ordainedhis help by the gods. But, O hero, do thou speedily go outwith me and soothe thy friend aggrieved for the ravishmentof his wife.

I know those monkeys that I have first despatched,to be gifted with great velocity130,—yet, for urging speed uponthem, do thou send other foremost of monkeys. Do thoudirectly bring up here those monkey-chiefs that are givenup to lust or are dilatory. Those wicked ones, that findingfault with the royal mandate, do not (come in) at mycommand within ten days, must be slain. Let those hundredsand thousands and kotis of leonine monkeys that abide bymy mandate, hie (hence) at my behest. Let (monkeys)resembling clouds or mountains, cover up the sky; and letthe foremost monkeys of dreadful forms march hence at mycommand. Let all the monkeys on earth, acquainted withmotion, hying themselves and summoning speed at mycommand, bring all the monkeys.\" Hearing the words ofthe monkey-king, the son of the Wind-god despatchedpowerful monkeys in all directions. Despatched by the king, themonkeys, ranging the sphere of birds and stars, immediatelywent through the welkin. And on oceans and mountains,in forests and tanks, the monkeys began to send away all theapes on behalf of Rāma. Hearing the mandate of that kingof kings, Sugriva, resembling the Hour of death, the monkeys,conceiving fear for Sugriva, set out. And monkeys resemblingcollyrium (in hue), numbering three kotis, endeued with hugemight, set out from the Anjana hill for the place whereRāghava was. And ten kotis having the splendour of moltengold, inhabiting the mountain where the sun sets, set out.And a thousand kotis, hued like the lion's mane, came fromthe peaks of Kailāça. And of those dwelling in Himalaya,subsisting on fruits and roots, numbering a thousand andkotis, a thousand appeared. And thousands of dreadfulmonkeys of terrible deeds, hued like charcoal, numberingkotis, rushed suddenly from Vindhya. And there exists norecord of the number of those inhabiting the shores of theocean of milk, and the dwellers in the Tamāla forests, as well asthose subsisting on cocoanuts. And, as if drinking up the sun,the mighty monkey host came from forests and caves andrivers. And it came to pass that those heroic monkeys thathad gone away to spur others on, found a mighty tree onHimavat. On that sacred mount in days of yore there tookplace a pleasing Māheçwara131 sacrifice. There the monkeysfound grateful fruits and roots sprung from the streams ofsacrificial oblations, and resembling ambrosia. He thatpartakes of those excellent fruits and roots sprung from thesacrificial ingredients, doth not experience hunger for amonth. Those prime monkeys, feeding on fruits, gatheredthose sapid fruits and roots and medicinal herbs. And forcompassing the good of Sugriva, repairing thither, themonkeys brought ordorous blossoms from the sacrificialground. And all those foremost of monkeys, taking all themonkeys of the earth, hastily set off in the van of the herds.And in a short while, those fast-fleeting apes speedily reachedKishkindhā, where the monkey Sugriva was. And takingthe healing herbs and the fruits and roots, the monkeys madethem over to Sugriva, and said, \"Having traversed mountains,rivers and forests, all the monkeys of the earth bend theirsteps towards thee in obedience to thy command.\" Hearingthis, Sugriva—lord of monkeys—was well pleased, and witha glad heart accepted all those presents."

Then Lakshmana in sweet words spokeunto the exceedingly strong chief of monkeys—Sugriva—gladdening him, \"If it please thee, O placid one, I will goout of Kishkindhā.\" Hearing Lakshmana's soft speech,Sugriva, highly delighted, said, \"Be it so.

Then Sugriva in a loud voice summoned the foremostmonkeys, saying, \"Come (hither).\" Hearing his words, thosemonkeys that could present themselves before the females,did so with joined hands. To them, who hadpresented themselves, said the king, of splendour resemblingthat of the Sun, \"Do, ye monkeys, bring hither a car.\"bearing his words, monkeys uniting vigor with celerity,brought a car lovely to behold.

And beholding the mightyhost of the monkeys resembling a tank filled with lotus buds,Rāma was well-pleased with Sugriva. And raising up themonkey-king who had bent his head at Rāma's feet, Rāghavaembraced him from love and regard.

Then appeared to the view the stout monkey,named Durmukha, heroic lord of herds, surrounded by two kotis.And Hanumān showed himself, surrounded by a thousandkotis of monkeys, resembling peaks of Kailaça, of dreadfulvigor. And the exceedingly energetic Nala came, attendedwith an hundred kotis, a thousand, and an hundred monkeys,living in trees. Then surrounded by ten kotis (of monkeys),came the shapely Darimukha before the high-souledSugriva, from a country bordering on a river. And Sarabha,Kumuda, Vahni, the monkey Rambha,—and many othermonkeys—lords of herds—passing ennumeration—wearingshapes at will, came, covering the entire earth with hermountains and forests. And all the monkeys of the world weresome of them coming and others putting up. And monkeys—some of them dripping, and some leaping, and someroaring—gathered round Sugriva, like clouds gathering round thesun. And, crying in various tones, prime monkeysfurnished with arms, with bent heads spoke humbly to that lord ofmonkeys—Sugriva. And other foremost of monkeys,gathering together duly, came before Sugriva with joined hands.Sugriva standing with joined hands, expeditiously informedRāma of the arrival of the monkey-leaders in hot haste; andthen spake (to them), saying, \"O chiefs of monkeys, stationingthe forces duly near mountain-rills and all the woods, let himthat is conversant with the army, ascertain who have comeand who have not.\""

  "Āranya, Kishkindhā, and Sundara Kāndam": "Xhen that lord of monkeys, the successful Sugriva, spakeunto Rāma—lion among men and destroyer of hostile hosts—saying, \"Those foremost monkeys endeued with strength andcapable of wearing any shape at will, and possessed of thesplendour of the mighty Indra,—that inhabit my territories,have come and stationed themselves. And these monkeys—dreadful, and resembling Daityas and Dānavas—areaccompanied by powerful monkeys of terrific prowess, whohave displayed their virtue in many a field,—and are offamed renown in battle and, powerful, and who havemastered languor and are celebrated in prowess andsterling in their profession. O Rāma, these kotis ofapes that have arrived, inhabiting earth and water andvarious mountainous tracts, are at thy service. All abideby thy command—all are intent upon the welfare of theirmaster, and, O subduer of foes, they are competent to bringabout thy end. And in company with many thousands andinnumerable ones that have shewn their ability in many afield, have come monkeys dreadful, and resembling Daityasand Dānavas. If, O lion among men, thou conceive thatthe time is ripe, tell it (unto me). It behoves thee tocommand those forces, remaining under thy sway. Although Iam full well acquainted with the work in which they are tobe employed, yet thou ought to order them as to what theyare to accomplish.\" When Sugriva had spoken thus,Daçaratha's son, Rāma, embracing him with his arms, said,\"O placid one, do thou learn whether Videha's daughter isalive or not; as well as ascertain the country, where, O thouendowed with eminent wisdom, liveth Rāvana. Having comeat Vaidehi and Rāvana's abode, shall I then appoint the timealong with thee. O lord of monkeys, I am not the master inthis matter, nor Lakshmana: thou art the cause of thisundertaking, as well as, O monarch of monkeys, the lord. Dothou therefore, O lord, command these as to what is to bedone by them in my behalf. O hero, thou certainly knowestmy business. My second friend (Lakshmana being first),thou art potent, wise, conversant with seasonableness,cognizant of profit, and engaged in our welfare.\" Thus addressed,Sugriva in presence of Rāma and the intelligent Lakshmana,said unto a leader of herds and lord of apes, named Vinatā,having the splendour of a hill, blazing and emitting soundsas those of clouds, \"O foremost of monkeys, accompaniedwith apes resembling the sun and the moon, thou cognizantof time, place and morals, and sagacious in deciding courseof action,—surrounded by hundreds and thousands of activeapes, march towards the Eastern quarter, furnished withwoods, forests and hills. There, in mountain fastnesses, andforests and rivers, do thou search Videha's daughter, Sitā, aswell as the abode of Rāvana. And while on the searcharound for Rāma's beloved wife, Sitā, daughter-in-law untoDaçaratha, thou shouldst search the beautiful Bhāgirathi, andthe Sarayu, and the Kauçiki; the Kalindi, and the charmingYamunā, and the mighty hill bordering thereon; and theSaraswati, and the Sindhu, and the Sona with waterresembling ruby; and the Mahi and Kālamahi, garnished withwoods and hills,—the large tracts—Brahmamālas, Videhas,and Mālavans, and Kāçikosalas, and Māgadhas, and Pundras,and Angas; and grounds native to silkworms, andcontaining mines of silver; and mountains and cities embosmed inthe sea. Do thou also search through the houses in Mandara,—belonging to people having ears resembling cloths,reaching their nether lips, and mouths resembling iron,—one-footed and fleet withal; and whose descendants neverdeteriorate;—and to anthropophagi; and hunters dwellingon islands; having sharp hair, gold-hued, pleasing, andsubsisting on raw fish; and to creatures—tiger-man forms—terribleto behold; and, ye dwellers of woods, do ye carefully searchthose places that are accessible by crags and bounds,—andthe island of Yava, adorned by seven several kingdoms, andthe island of Suvarna, and Rupayaka,—thronged by goldminers. And, going beyond the island of Yava, (one comesupon) the hill called Sisira, which pierceth the heavens byits peaks, and is inhabited by gods and demons. In all thesemountain fastnesses, cascades and woods, do ye togethersearch for the renowned wife of Rāma. Then, arriving at therapid red waters going under the name of Sona,and repairingto the other shore of the ocean, the abode of Siddhas andCharanas, do ye search all round for Rāvana in companywith Sitā in the sweet sacred spots and picturesque woods.And ye should explore forests, mountain-sprung streams, wildtracts subject to storms, and mountains containing caverns.Then it behoves you to examine horrible ocean islands,heaving with waves, terrific, resounding,—of haughty bearingin consequence of winds. There, huge-bodied Asuras,hungering for a long period, permitted by Brahma, capturecreatures, resorting to shades. And adroitly arriving at thatgreat sea, like unto clouds at the universal dissolution,inhabited by mighty snakes, sending loud sounds,—and there, afterpassing the terrific sea of red waters called Yellow, ye willbehold a mighty knarled Sālmali, There, built byViçwakarman, peak-like, gigantic, resembling Kailaça, (towereth) themansion of Vinatā's offspring, named Mandeha. There, grimRākshasas named Mandehas, resembling hills, of diverseshapes, capable of inspiring fear, hang head foremost on therocks. Day after day at sunrise, these Rākshasas heated (bysolar rays) and struck dead by Brahma energy,134 again andagain (hang on the crags). Then wilt thou, O thou that arthard to repress, proceeding, view the sea named Kshiroda,having the hue of pale clouds, and looking like a necklace,because of the ripples (on its surface). In it there are themighty white mountains going by the name of Rishada,covered with trees bearing oderous blossoms; as well asthe tank known under the name of Sudarçana, swarming withswans and shining silver lotuses having golden filaments.Desirous of sport, resort to this tank delighted troops ofVivudhas and Chāranas, Yakshas, Kinnaras and Apsarās.Leaving behind Kshiroda, ye monkeys, ye will soonafter behold the Jalada sea, striking terror into all beings.There presideth that mighty ire-born Energy of him,135(embodied in) the mouth of a mule. This wondrous (universe)containing mobile and immobile things and fraught withgreat impetus, is the aliment of this Energy. There areheard the cries of feeble creatures inhabiting the sea, whobegan to wail on witnessing the mouth of the mule. On thenorth of the Swādu sea, lie thirteen yojanas (of land), namedJātarupaçila,136 exceeding spacious, and of the splendour ofgold. There, ye monkeys, ye will behold that serpent, theholder of Earth—resembling the moon, and with expansiveeyes like lotus-petals—seated at the summit of the mount,—that one worshipped of all deities, having a thousand heads,—the god Ananta, clad in blue apparel. And by the dais(there) at the top of the mount is the golden palm, plantedby that high souled one,—which is like a banner. The chiefof the celestials reared it in the Eastern region. After thatis the fair Rising mountain. Its golden peak measuring ahundred yojanas, reaching unto the heavens, rises nobly, withmountains at its base; and looks beautiful with Sālas, palms,Tamālas, and flowering Karnikāras,—golden, splendid andresembling the sun. There,137 spreading a yojana around,towering up ten, is the peak named Saumanasa—all certainlyof gold. There, formerly on the occasion of invading theearth with three paces, that foremost of persons, Vishnu,planting his first foot, planted the other on the summit ofMeru. The sun, having passed by Jamvudwipa on thenorth, and, arriving at that mighty and eminent summit,(Saumanasa), again becometh visible to the dwellers ofJamvudwipa. There are seen those Vālakhilya Maharshis,named Vaikhānasas,—wearing the hue of the sun, leading anascetic mode of life. This is the island of Sudarçana, beforewhich all creatures inspire energy and have their sightgranted to them. You should search for Rāvana with Vaidehiall round the top of that mountain as well as in its forests andwoods. (Here) the first twilight enfolded in the glory of thegolden hill and that of the high-souled Sun, appeareth roseate.As this is the first gateway of both Earth and Heaven, and asthe sun first rises in this quarter, this is called the East. Yeshould search the breast of its mountain, and fountains, andcaves for Rāvana in company with Vaidehi. Beyond that, isthe exceedingly impassable Eastern quarter, thronged bythe celestials,—covered with darkness and devoid of thesun and the moon. Do ye search for Jānaki in all thoserocks, woods and streams as well as in such spots asI have not mentioned. Ye foremost of monkeys, themonkeys are competent to proceed thus far. Beyondthis, of the tract without sun and without limit, I knownothing. Meeting with Vaidehi and (arriving at) Rāvana'smansion, do ye, having reached the Rising hill, turnback, when it shall be a full month. Do not stay longer thana month. If ye do, ye shall be slain by me. Having attainedyour end, do ye turn back, having met with Maithili. Havingadroitly explored (the tract) loved of Mahendra, plated withwoods, do ye, ye monkeys, having come at Sitā—the belovedwife of that descendant of Raghu—desist, attaining happiness.\""

  "Āranya, Kishkindhā, and Sundara Kāndam": "Then having sent away that mighty host of monkeys,Sugriva despatched to the South others competent to performtlie several tasks entrusted to them. And appointing theexceedingly mighty Angada as the leader of those heroic monkeys,that hero, the lord of monkey bands, conversant with thecountries intended to be explored, despatched heroesendowed with speed and prowess, headed by Angada, Nila the sonof Fire, and the monkey Hanumān, and the exceedinglyenergetic Jambavān, son unto the Great-father, and Suhotra,and Sarāri, and Saragulma, Gaya, Gavākshya, and Gavaya,Sushena, Vrishabha, Mainda, Dwivida, and Gandhamādana,and Ulkāmukha and Ananga—sons of Fire both. And thelord of monkeys began to describe unto the monkey-chiefsthose tracts in those directions, that were difficult of access.\"Ye will behold Vindhya having an hundred summits, andbrushed with various trees and shrubs, and the romanticriver Narmada, frequented by mighty serpents; and theGodāvari,138 and that mighty river, the captivating Krishnaveni,and the Mekhalas and Utkalas, and the cities of Daçārna;and Avravanti and Avanti, and the Vidarbhas and Nishtikasand the charming Māhishakas.139 And ye will see also theMatsyas and Kalingas and Kauçikas all round, and the forestof Dandaka, with mountains, rivers and caverns; and the riverGodāvari,140 and the Andhras, and Paundras, the Cholas, thePandyas, and the Keralas. Then shall ye repair to themountain Ayomukha,141 plated with ore, having takingsummits, graceful, furnished with picturesque flowering woods,—the mighty mountain having groves of excellent sandal. Atthe foot of the Malaya mountain endeued with exceedingenergy, ye will behold the noble stream Kāveri, of pleasantwaters, where sport troops of Apsarās. (There) you will seethat foremost of saints, Agastya, resembling the sun.Permitted by that gratified high-souled one, ye will cross overthe great river, Tāmraparni, abounding in alligators. Like ayouthful female in relation to her lover, she (Tāmraparni),with both her waters as well as islets concealed underbeautiful sandal woods, bathes in the sea. Proceeding (therefrom),the monkeys shall see the grand golden gates belonging tothe walls of the capital of the Pāndyas. Then arriving at themain, ye shall ascertain your ability or otherwise of crossingthe same. In the bosom of the deep there, Agastya hathplaced that foremost of mountains—the charming Mahendra,having picturesque plateaus; golden, and beautiful,—with aportion of it sunk in the great ocean. For aye, He ofa thousand eyes at Parvas visiteth this mountain embellishedby various blossoming trees and creepers; beauteous withdivinities, and saints, and the foremost Yakshas and Apsarās;thronged by numbers of Siddhas and Charanas; and ofsurpassing loveliness. On its other shore is an island extendingover an hundred yojanas, inaccessible to men142 and of splendidaspect. Do ye explore it all round. There, in particular, yemust every way search for Sitā. That country belongs tothe impious Rāvana, worthy of being slain—the lord ofRākshasas, like unto the thousand-eyed (deity) in splendour.In the midst of the Southern sea belonging to him (Rāvana),there is a Rākshasi, named Angā, who procureth her preyby casting her shadow. Having (by your search) satisfiedyourselves as to those countries where ye might suspect Sitāto be, do ye, your doubts dispelled, proceeding beyond that,(Lankā), search for the spouse of that monarch endeued withunbounded energy. In the sea extending over an hundredyojanas, a lovely hill, named Pushpitaka, the abode of Siddhasand Chāranas; resembling the rays of the sun or the moon,—resting on the waters of the ocean, looks splendid, piercingthe heavens with its giant peaks. Of this (mountain), thereis a particular golden summit, which the sun approaches. Itis incapable of being beheld by the ungrateful or theatheistical. Bowing your heads down unto this hill, let the monkeyssearch on. Leaving behind that irrepressible one, (ye willcome upon) a mountain difficult of approach, extending overfourteen yojanas, named Suryyavān. Passing by that also, (yewill see) a mountain, named Vidyut, filled with trees,beautiful at all seasons, and bearing all desirable fruits. There,feeding upon excellent and costly fruits and roots, anddrinking delicious honey, let the monkeys pass beyond it.There is the hill named Kunjara, grateful both to the eye andthe mind,—where Viçwakarmā had built the abode ofAgastya.143 There (rises) that stately golden pile, adornedwith various gems, extending over one yojana, and ten inheight. In it144 also there is that palace, which is the abode ofsnakes; having spacious ways, incapable of being captured,guarded around, and protected by dreadful snakes andsharp-toothed serpents of virulent poison; where dwelleth Vāsuki,the exceedingly terrible king of snakes. Proceedingheedfully, ye must explore that Bhogavati palace; as also whateverconcealed places may lie there. Going beyond that place,(ye will see) the mighty mountain named Rhrishava, in theform of a bull, full of all gems, and possessed of grace,—where are produced excellent Goçirshaka, Padmaka, andHaricyāma sandals, and which in effulgence resembles fire.But, seeing that sandal, ye must by no means ask anyquestions: certain Gandharbas, named Rohitas, are on guardover that wood—the lords of Gandharbas, in splendour likeunto five suns,—Cailusha, Grāmani, Ciksha, Cuka, and Babhru.After that, (Rhishava), at the extremity of the Earth is theabode of persons of pious acts, whose bodies are composed ofthe Sun, the Moon and Fire. And there reside persons whohave won the heavenly regions. After that are the awfulregions of the ancestral manes, which ye must notapproach. This is the metropolis of Yama, covered by deepgloom. Ye heroic monkey chiefs, ye can seek thus far.Further there is no course for those endeued withmotion. Having examined all these, as well others that maycome within your ken, it behoves you, after having ascertainedVaidehi's course, to return (hither). He that, returningwithin a month, shall say,—\"I have seen Sitā,\" shall pass his daysin happiness, enjoying affluence like mine own andindulging all pleasures. He shall be dearer unto me than life itself,and none dearer (unto me) than he; and although he mightcommit innumerable wrongs, still should he become my friend.Possessed of immeasurable strength and prowess, and sprungfrom lines crowned with sterling virtues, do ye strive manfullyin such a glorious way that the king's daughter may berecovered.\""

  "Āranya, Kishkindhā, and Sundara Kāndam": "Having despatched those monkeys in a southerndirection, Sugriva spoke unto the monkey named Sushena,resembling a mass of clouds. Approaching his father-in-law,Tārā's father, possessed of dreadful prowess, the king, bowingand with joined hands, spoke unto him. And Sugrivacommanded the Maharshi's son, Māricha, and the mighty ape,Archishmat, surrounded hy the heroic foremost of monkeys,—possessing the splendour of Mahendra, gifted with senseand vigor; and resembling the offspring himself of Vinatā inbrightness; and Marichi's son,—the Mārichas—the mightyArchirmālyas,—all these sons of the saint145 —(to march) towardsthe West, saying,—\"Ye monkey-chiefs, let twice hundredthousand monkeys led by Sushena (set out) to search Vaidehi.Ye foremost of monkeys, do ye explore the Saurāshtras, theBāhlikas, the Chandrachitras, and (other) populous and fairprovinces and spacious cities, and Kukshi, dense withPunnāgas,146 and filled with Vakulas and Uddalakas; as wellas the tracts covered with Ketaka trees; and auspiciousstreams bearing their cool waters westward; and the forestsof ascetics; and mountains embosoming woods. There havingexplored tracts resembling deserts, and cold cliffs toweringhigh, and the West, covered with mountain ranges, andextremely difficult of access,—and proceeding at a little more to thewest, it behoves you to have a view of the sea. Andproceeding on, ye monkeys, ye shall see (the ocean), whosewaters abound in whales and alligators, ye monkeys.147 Thenthe apes shall sport in tracts covered by Ketakas, and densewith Tomālas and woods of cocoanuts. There shall yelook for Sitā and the mansion of Rāvana, in hills andwoods on the shores of the sea; and (explore) Murachipattana,and the delightful Jatāpura, and Avanti, and Angalapā, aswell as in the wood (called) Alakshita, and spaciousmonarchies, and emporiums. There is a mighty mountainwhere the Sindhu falls into the sea, Somagiri by name;having an hundred summits and tall trees. In its plateausthere are certain birds (called) Sinhas. These lift up to theirnests whales and elephants. The proud elephants carried tothe nests and remaining on the summits of the mountain,possessing the roar of clouds,having been gratified (with food),range around this extensive table-land filled with water.The monkeys, capable of wearing shapes at will, shouldswiftly search its golden summit towering to the sky andfilled with graceful trees. Proceeding further, the monkeysshall behold the golden summit of Pāriyātra rising from thesea and extending over an hundred yojanas. There dwellall around in a body four and twenty kotis of asceticGandharbas, resembling fire, dreadful, practicising impiety,and like unto flames of fire. The monkeys of dreadful prowessshould not present themselves before those, nor should theytake any fruits from that country. Those heroes are hardto approach; and they are truthful and possessed of greatmight. And there they of dreadful prowess stow away theirfruits and roots. There ye should needfully search for Jānaki.Ye have no fear whatever from them; do ye only follow yournative nature as monkeys. There, in hue like lapises,abounding in various kinds of trees and plants, is a mighty hill ofan adamantine basis, called Vajra; beautiful, famous, andmeasuring an hundred yojanas in height and area. There letthe monkeys carefully explore the caves. On the fourth sideof the Ocean is a mountain named Chakravān. ThereViçwakarmā forged the discus (called) Sahasrāra. There,slaying Panchajana and the Dānava, Hayagriva,148 the Best ofmale beings obtained the discus as well as the conch. Inthose beautiful plateaus and huge caves, ye shouldeverywhere search for Rāvana with Videha's daughter. Sunk inthe depths of the sea, is a very great mountain named Varāha,having golden peaks and measuring four and sixty yojanas.In it is a city named Prāgjyotisha, all of gold. There dwellsthe wicked Dānava named Naraka.149 There do yeeverywhere search for Rāvana along with Vaidehi in the beautifulplateaus and huge caves. Passing beyond that foremost ofmountains, whose sight betrays the secret of its bowels beingfreighted with gold, (ye shall come upon) the mountainSarvasauvarna, furnished with fountains and cascades.Coming to it, elephants, and boars, and lions, and tigers, on allsides roar ceaselessly, wrought up by the echoes their owncries have produced. This is the mountain named Megha,where the graceful green-horsed vanquisher of Pāka,Mahendra, was installed king by the gods. Having passed by thatmountain protected by Mahendra, ye shall repair to sixtythousand hills of gold; in hue like the infant sun, and blazingon all sides and embellished by blossoming golden trees. Inthe midst of them is established as king, Meru, best ofmountains. Formerly the Sun being well pleased, conferreda boon on this mountain, and he addressed the mountain,saying,—'By my grace all the hills that are under thyprotection, shall be golden day and night; and alsothose gods Gandharbas and Dānavas that shall dwell inthee, shall be filled with reverence for me and to the bootattain a golden glory.' Coming to the excellent mountainMeru, Viçwadevas, the Vasus, the Maruts and the celestials,adore the Sun in the western twilight. Adored by them, theSun, becoming invisible, repaireth to the Setting hill.150 Inhalf a muhurta, the Sun swiftly passes over this (mountain),measuring, as it does, ten thousand yojanas. On its peak risesan edifice; resembling the sun (in splendour); consisting ofpalatial mansions built by Viçwakarmā; and graced by goodlytrees rife with various birds,—the residence of thehigh-souled Varuna, bearing the noose in his hand. Between Meruand the Setting hill, towers a tall palm having ten heads.Golden and graceful, it shineth on a variegated dais. In allthese, difficult of access, as also in rivers and tanks, ye shouldthoroughly search for Rāvana along with Vaidehi. Theredwells there the righteous and famous Merusāvarni, sanctifiedby virtue of his own asceticism, and like unto Brahmā, himself.151Bowing down your heads to the earth, ye should ask theMaharshi Merusāvarni, resembling the sun, touching Mithilā'sdaughter. On the departure of night, the sun dispells thedarkness of the world to this extent, and then enters theSetting hill. Ye foremost of monkeys, the monkeys are able toproceed thus far. Beyond this, of what is sunless andboundless I know nothing. Having come to Vaidehi and Rāvana'smansions, and arrived at the Setting-hill, do ye return on themonth being complete. Ye must not stay above a month; andif ye do, ye must be slain by me. And along with you goeththat hero, my father-in-law. Ye, abiding by his orders,should listen to all that he sayeth. My mighty-armed father-in-law. gifted with great strength, is my spiritual preceptor.All of you possessed of prowess, yourselves certainlyconstitute the measure whereby to ascertain the wisdom orotherwise of a course. Making this one also into a measure,survey the western quarter. Having requited the good thathath been done to us, we shall attain our end. De ye alsodetermine what else is agreeable (unto Rāma), and inconsonance with place, season and profit, should be performedby you in the matter of this business.\" Then those monkeys—the monkey chiefs headed by Sushena, having heard Sugriva'sdeft speech, set out for the quarter protected by Varuna."

  "Āranya, Kishkindhā, and Sundara Kāndam": "Having directed his father-in-law to proceed to theWest, that best of monkeys, the all-knowing king Sugriva,lord of apes, then spake unto the heroic monkey, namedSatavala, words fraught with good unto himself as well asunto Rāma,—\"Surrounded by hundreds and thousands ofrangers of the forest like thyself, in company with theoffspring of Yama as well as the counsellors in a body, dothou, O thou possessed of prowess, entering the northernquarter furnished with the Hima çaila, searcheverywhere for the illustrious spouse of Rāma.—Having performedthis task satisfactorily, and brought about what is dear untoDaçaratha's son, we shall, O best of those that achievesuccess, be freed from our debts. The high-souled Rāghava hathdone us good. If we can serve him in turn, our life shall becrowned with success. Even the life of him that accomplishesthe work of one to whom the former is not obliged, issuccessful,—what then is to be said in respect of him that hathserved one formerly? Pondering this, those that are engagedin our welfare, should so act that Jānaki may be discovered.And this formemost of men is worthy of being honored byall creatures; and Rāma—captor of hostile capitals—hathalso found delight in us. Endowed with sense and prowess,do ye explore these many inaccessible places, rivers andmountains. Having searched there Mlechahhas, Pulindas,Surasenas, Prasthalas, Bharatas, Kurus, and Madrakas, andVaradas, as well as the cities of Kāmbojas, Yavanas andSakas, do ye explore Himavān. And in tracts of Lodhras andPadmakas, and in Devadāru woods152 do ye search thoroughlyfor Rāvana along with Videha's daughter. Then, comingupon the hermitage of Soma, frequented by gods andGandharbas, do ye repair to the mountain called Kāla possessingspacious plateaus. In those mighty mountains, as also inothers and in their caves, do ye search for that exalted lady,the blameless wife of Rāma. Having passed beyond thatmighty mountain containing gold in its womb, it behovesyou to go to the mountain called Sudarçana. Then (lies)the mountain called Devasakhā, the home of feathered tribes;abounding in various fowls,and embellished with diverse trees.In its golden tracts, fountains and caves, do ye search forRāvana along with Videha's daughter. Going beyond it,(ye come upon) a vacant land, measuring an hundred Yojanas,without mountains, or rivers, or trees; and void of all livingbeings. Speedily passing that desert land capable of makingone's hair stand on end, ye shall feel delighted, on comingto the pale Kailāça. There (ye will behold) the charmingmansion of Kuvera,resembling pale clouds, of burnished gold,built by Viçwakarma; where (lies) the spacious tankoverflowing with lotuses and lilies, thronged with swans andKārandavas, and frequented by troops of Apsarās. Thereking Vaiçravana, the lord of Yakshas, bowed down unto byall creatures,—the graceful giver of riches—sporteth alongwith the Guhyakas. In the offshoots belonging to Kailāçaresembling the moon, as also in their caverns,do ye thoroughlysearch for Rāvana in company with Vaidehi. And coming tothe Krauncha mountain,ye shou1d,having your wits about you,enter its inaccessible cavern; for that is well known asdifficult of entrance. There dwell certain Maharshis, high-souled,of effulgence resembling that of the sun—complete god-likeshapes,—who are sought by the deities themselves. And yeshould thoroughly explore the other caves of Krauncha, itsplateaus and peaks; its passes and sides. (Then is) thetreeless Mānasa—abode of birds—the scene of Kāma's austerities.Way there is none for creatures, or for gods, or for Rākshasas.That also must be explored by you,—that mountain withplains and plateaus. Going beyond Krauncha, (ye shall see)the mountain, named Maināka. There is the residence of theDānava, Maya, reared by himself. Maināka also with itsplains, plateaus and woods must be searched by you. Thereare all over, the homes of females with faces resembling thoseof horses. Going beyond that part, (ye shall come to) theasylum inhabited by Siddhas; where are ascetics—Vālakhilyas,Siddhas and Vaikhānasas. Saluting those Siddhas, who havebeen cleansed of their sins on account of their asceticism, yeshould in humble guise ask them concerning Sitā. There isthe Vaikhānasa tank filled with golden lotuses; and rangedby graceful cranes of the hue of the infant sun. Kuvera'svehicle, the elephant known (by the name of) Sārvabhauma,ever rangeth that country in company with she-elephants.Going beyond that expanse of water, (ye come upon) a skyvoid of stars, and where the sun and the moon have been putout; and that land is visible by the rays, as if of the sun,proceeding from (the persons of) self-luminous, god-like ones,who are reposing there, after achieving success in austerities.Leaving behind that region, (you come to) a stream namedSailodā. On its both banks are bamboos named Kichaka.These take the Siddhas to the other shore and bring themback again. There (are seen) the northern Kurus, the abodeof those that have acquired religious merit. And there aretanks there with their waters crowned with golden lotuses.There are rivers by thousands with copious blue lapis leaves.And the pools here,resembling the tender sun, are embellishedwith assemblages of golden red lotuses. And that tract is everywhere filled with costly gems, and jewels, and woods of bluelotuses, having filaments splendid like gold; and with roundpearls and costly jewels. And the rivers there have isletscovered with gold; and are crowded with lovely hills of gold,bright as fire, furnished with all kinds of precious stones. Andthe trees there, thronged with birds, bear flowers and fruitsdaily; and, charged with savoury juices, publishing superbperfumes, and of delicious feel, they confer every wish. Otherexcellent trees bring forth attires of divers kinds, andornaments decked with pearls and lapises,—coveted alike by malesand females153. And other excellent trees bear fruits fit to bepartaken at all seasons. And other excellent trees bring forthprecious beds dight with costly jewels and furnished withvariegated covers. And other trees bring forth charmingwreaths, and costly drinks, and various kinds of viands. Andfemales adorned with every accomplishment, and endowedwith youth and beauty, and Gandharbas and Kinnaras, andSiddhas and Nāgas and Vidyādharas, of blazing splendour,ceaselessly sport there in company with females. And all ofrighteous deeds, and all engaged in amorous disports, and allfurnished with desire and profit,—dwell in that place inassociation with their females.

Passing beyond that is the Northernocean. In the bosom (of the deep) is the mountain namedSomagiri, golden and of great dimensions. Albeit without thesun, yet through the brightness of the Soma mountain, tbeland shines forth with all the loveliness and reality of onewarmed by the sun.

Ye cannot proceed to the north of theKurus; nor is there way in that region for any othercreatures. And that mountain is named Soma, incapable of beingentered even by the gods. Sighting this, you should speedilyturn back. Ye foremost of monkeys, the monkeys arecompetent to proceed thus far. Beyond that, of regions sunlessand limitless I know nothing. Ye should search all thesewhich I have described (unto you); and ye should also turnyour attention to others besides, which I have omitted tomention. Ye that are comparable unto the wind or fire, byaccomplishing the work of beholding Videha's daughter, yewill do what is held as exceedingly dear unto Daçaratha'sson as well as highly grateful to me.

Sitā not having been found out, Sugriva,for certain, shall commit this sin.171 Therefore it is fit that,forsaking our sons, and wives, and wealth, and homes, we thisvery day sit down to starve ourselves to death. Death atthis place is preferrable to the unequal punishment (we mustmeet with at the hands of Sugriva). And, further, I have notbeen installed heir-apparent by Sugriva: I have beensprinkled by that foremost of kings, Rāma of untiring energy.Entertaining enmity against me of old, the king, seeing thislapse, must be firmly determined to take my life by means of asevere sentence. What is the use of suffering my friends tolook on my disaster at the last moment of my existence?Therefore even on this sacred shore of the sea shall I sitdown to starve myself.” Hearing the tender prince speakthus, all those principal monkeys pathetically observed,—“Sugriva is harsh by nature, and Rāghava loveth his wifedearly.

Having come hither as the principalservants of Sugriva, we shall either see Sitā or obtaininformation concerning her, or else, O hero, we shall repair to themansion of Yama.” Hearing the speeches of the monkeysafflicted with fear, Tāra said,—\"No use of indulging in grief.If ye relish it, let us all entering the cave, dwell there. Thisplace abounding in flowers and waters, meats and drinks,—which hath been brought forth by the power of illusion, isincapable of being approached. Here we have no fear fromPurandara, or Rāghava, or the king of monkeys.” Hearing thewelcome words of Angada, the monkeys, being convinced,said,—“Do thou this very day so order that we may notbe slain.”"

  "Āranya, Kishkindhā, and Sundara Kāndam": "When Tāra, bright as the moon, had spoken thus,Hanumān felt as if Angada had already deprived (Sugriva)of his kingdom.172 Hanumān deemed Vāli’s son as endowedwith intelligence consisting of eight elements; with powerof four kinds; and the four and ten virtues; as ever fraughtwith energy, strength and prowess; as growing in gracelike the moon during the lighted fortnight; as resemblingBrihaspati in intelligence; and in prowess, his own sire;and as ever listening to Tāra’s counsels, as Purandara listensto the counsels of Sukra. And Hanumān versed in allbranches of learning, finding Angada Backward in the affairof his master, began to inspire him with fear.173 He,wealthy in words, laying under contribution the second ofthe four means,174 had created division among those monkeys.On their being divided, he (Hanumān) set about raisingAngada's apprehension by various fear-fraught speech,referring to punishments. \"O Tara's son, thou art for certain morecapable of fight than even thy sire; and thou art also able tohold the monkey-kingdom as firmly as he. But, O foremostof monkeys, the monkeys are always inconstant in character.Bereft of their wives and sons, they shall not bear thy behest.And they shall never take to thee. This I tell thee inpresence of all. And I will tell thee what. Thou neitherby the virtues of conciliation, charity and the rest, nor bychastisement, shalt succeed in drawing to thy side thisJāmbavān, or Nila, or the mighty ape Suhotra, or myself.A strong one wronging another that is weak, can live;therefore a weak person anxious for self-preservation, shouldnever wrong (a strong individual). Thou considerest that thiscave may serve for thy protectress,175 having heard of it (saidby Tāra); but to rive the same is but light work for theshafts of Lakshmana. Formerly this was cleft a little byIndra, with his thunderbolt hurled (against it)176; but nowLakshmana would pierce it like a leaf-stalk, by means ofhis keen arrows. Lakshmana hath many an iron arrow likeIndra's thunderbolt or that of the sky,177 capable of riving evenmountains. O subduer of enemies, soon as thou shalt setup here, the monkeys, making up their minds, shall forsakethee. Remembering their wives and sons, ever anxious(on account of Sugriva), pining for domestic happiness,and aggrieved (at their pitiable plight), they shallturn their backs upon thee. Then forsaken by thy kindredas well as friends seeking thy welfare, thou shalt bestruck with affright even at a quaking blade of grass.If thou make head (against Sugriva), the sharpened shaftsof Lakshmana, terrible, of exceeding impetuosity and mightyvehemence, and incapable of being baffled, shall be eager toslay thee. On the contrary, if thou in humble guise presentthyself (before him) along with us, he shall establish theein the kingdom, in consideration of thy being the next heir.A righteous sovereign, steady in vow, clean, and truthfulin promise, thy uncle, who cherishes affection for thee,shall not by any means chastise thee. And he loves thymother, and his life is for her; and she hath no other son.Therefore, O Angadu, go along with us.\""

He that, while her sonis living, appropriateth the beloved queen of his elder brother,mother unto him by morality, is hated of all beings). Howcan he that could cover up the mouth of the cave, when hehad been desired by his brother gone on martial mission,to guard the same,—(how can he) know morality? Whosegood office rememhereth he who could forget the renownedRāghava himself of mighty deeds, after having, in the nameof truth, taken his hand? How can he reap religious merit,that directed us to search Sitā here, from fear of Lakshmana,and not from fear of unrighteousness? What noble person,in especial, sprung in his race, shall any longer reposeconfidence in that impious one of unstable soul whohath run amuck of morality? Meritorious or otherwise,how can Sugriva, having installed in the kingdom me,son (of his enemy) and the enemy sprung in his race,—sufferme to live? How can I, whose counsels have been revealed,who have transgressed, and who have been deprived of mypower, repairing to Kishkindhā like one forlorn and feeble,live? For the sake of his kingdom, Sugriva, wily, cunningand cruel, shall put me in solitary confinement. For mefasting to death is better than being confined and suffering theconsequent misery. Do ye grant me your permision; andgo to your homes, ye monkeys. I vow before you, to thepalace I will never repair. At this very spot will I fast fordeath; as death is good for me. Bowing unto the king aswell as unto the powerful Rāghava, ye should communicate mywell-being unto Sugriva—lord of apes—and my health andpeace unto my mother Uma. And it behoves you also toconsole my mother, Tārā. Naturally fond of her son,and overflowing with tenderness, that lorn one, hearing ofmy death at this place, shall certainly renounce her life.\"Having said this, Angada, saluting the elders, with awoebegone face entered the earth covered with grass. When hehad entered, those foremost monkeys, stricken with sorrow,weeping shed warm tears from their eyes. And censuringSugriva and praising Vāli, they, surrounding Angada,determined to starve themselves to death. Taking to heart thespeech of Vāli's son, those prime monkeys, sipping water,sat down facing the East. And sitting on the edge of thewater on grass pointing to the south, the foremost monkeys,wishing for surcease, thought within themselves,—\"Eventhis is fit for us.\" And as they spoke of the exile of Rāmaand the demise of Daçaratha, the carnage in Janasthāna, theslaying of Jatāyu, the ravishment of Vaidehi, the slaughter ofVāli, and the ire of Rāma, the monkeys were seized with fear.When those monkeys resembling mountain-summits hadentered in, they set up cries, which, like unto the rumbling ofclouds, making the sky resound, made that mountain with itsrills reverberate."

And that long-lived bird was named Sampāti, thebeautiful brother of Jatāyu, famous for his strength andprowess. Issuing from a cavern of the mighty mountainVindhya, he, seeing the monkeys seated, well pleased, said—\"Verily man178 reapeth the fruit of his former acts; andtherefore it is that this food ordained to that end, comes to meafter a long time. I shall feed on these monkeys, one byone, slaying them one after another.\" Eying those apes,the bird expressed himself thus. Hearing this speech of thebird coveting his food, Angada faintly spoke to Hanumān,\"Behold! through Sitā's simplicity179 this one—the very son ofthe Sun, Yama—hath come to this place, to exterminate themonkeys. Rāma's work hath not been done; nor the royalmandate. And this disaster hath arrived unthought of bythe monkeys. Ye have in detail heard all that, inspired withthe desire of doing what is good unto Vaidehi, that king ofvultures, Jatāyu, did here. In this way, all creatures, eventhe brute species, compass the welfare of Rāma, renouncingtheir lives, as we do. It is because of the love andtenderness180 they bear towards (Rāma), that people do good untoeach other. And therefore the righteous Jatāyu, of hisown accord laying down his life, hath done the pleasure ofRāma. We also, overcome with fatigue and (almost) dying,have come to this forest; but Mithilā's daughter we find not.Happy is that king of vultures, having been slain by Rāvanain battle. He hath got quit of the fear of Sugriva, and hathalso attained supreme state. In consequence of the death ofJatāyu and that of king Daçaratha, as well as owing to theravishment of Vaidehi, (the lives of) the monkeys have comeinto jeopardy. Rāma's and Lakshmana's abode in the forestwith Sitā, Rāghava's slaying of Vāli with a shaft, the slaughterof innumerable Rākshasas by the enraged Rāma, and (finally)this mishap—all these owe their orgin to the bestowal of theboon on Kaikeyi.\" Seeing the monkeys stretched on theearth, and hearing their piteous words describing their grief,that magnanimous king of vultures, with his mind agitated,said (this). And hearing the words that issued from Angada'smouth, the sharp-beaked and high-toned vulture, said,—\"Who is it that, making my mind tremble, speaketh of thedeath of my brother, Jatāyu, dearer unto me than life? Howhappened in Janasthāna the fight between the Rākshasa andthe vulture? It is after a long time that to-day I hear thename of my brother. I wish to alight from thismountain-fastness. I have been well pleased by listening after a longtime to the celebration of the virtues of my younger brother,cognizant of qualities and worthy of being extolled by reasonof his prowess. Ye foremost of monkeys, I wish to hear ofthe destruction of Jatāyu, who dwelt in Janasthāna. Andhow could Daçaratha, whose beloved eldest son is Rāma,dear unto his superiors, be the friend of my brother? I cannot move in consequence of my wings having been burnt bythe solar rays.

If he eat usup, who have sat down to fast to death, we shall securesuccess, and speedily attain our end.\" Then thosemonkey-chiefs resolved thus. And descending from the summit ofthe mountain, Angada spoke unto the vulture,—\"There wasa lord of monkeys named Rhiksharāja, endowed withprowess. That king, O bird, was my grandsire. He had twovirtuous sons, exceedingly powerful both—Vāli and Sugriva.My father, Vāli, was famed in the world for his deeds.

And his spouse was forcibly carriedaway from Janasthāna. And the friend of Rāma's father, theking of vultures, named Jatāyu, saw Videha's daughter, Sitā,as she was being carried away in the sky. And after havingthrown down Rāvana from his car, and placed Maithili on theground, (that vulture) old and overcome with fatigue was (atlength) slain by Rāvana in battle. Thus slain by thepowerful Rāvana, the vulture, having had his funereal obsequiesperformed by Rāma (himself), hath attained excellent state.Then Rāghava made friends with my uncle, the high-souledSugriva; and he also slew my sire. My father had debarredSugriva from the kingdom along with his counsellors; butRāma, having slain Vāli, installed him (Sugriva). Andestablished in the monarchy by him (Rāma), Sugriva is (now)the master of the monkeys and king of all the foremostmonkeys. By him have we been sent. Despatched hitherby Rāma, we have searched for Sitā all round, but Vaidehiwe have not found, as one doth not find the solar splendourat night. And it came to pass that, having heedfully exploredthe Dandaka forest, we through ignorance entered a cavelying open before. That cave, thou must know, was constructedby the illusive energy of Maya.

Onaccount of my age and want of wings, I, although hearingthis, bear it. Nor have I strength to-day to clear scorestouching my brother's enmity. Formerly, while engaged inthe destruction of Vritra, he and I, burning for victory, soaredin the sky near the flaming sun, garlanded by glory. Thenceimpetuously wheeling round, we went to the celestial regionsalong the etherial way. And it came to pass that, comingmidway of the sun, Jatāyu was faint. Witnessing my brotherseverely struck by the solar rays, and exceedingly stupified,I from affection shadowed him with my wings. Thereat, mypinions scathed, I dropped down on Vindhya, ye foremost ofmonkeys; and staying here, I could not know thecircumstances that have befallen my brother.\" Thus addressed byJatāyu's brother, Sampāti, the eminently wise prince Angadaanswered,—\"if thou art indeed the brother of Jatāyu, havingheard what I have related, tell (us) if thou knowest touchingthe abode of that Rākshasa. Tell us if thou knowest anentthat short-sighted worst of Rākshasas, Rāvana, whetherstaying far or near.\" Thereat, rejoicing the monkeys, theexceedingly energetic elder brother of Jatāyu spoke wordsworthy of him,—\"Ye monkeys, my pinions have been burnt;and I am a vulture shorn of strength. Therefore I will helpRāma well by my words. I know the realms of Varuna, andVishnu's Trivikrama182 worlds, the wars of the gods and Asuras,and the churning for ambrosia. And albeit age hath deprivedme of energy, and albeit my life hangs loosely on me, yet, ifthis is Rāma's work, it should be done by me first. I haveseen a youthful and beautiful female, adorned with allornaments, carried away by the wicked Rāvana,—the lady (allthe while) crying, 'O Rāma!' 'O Rāma!' 'O Lakshmana!' Andtaking her ornaments from her person, she was throwing themon the ground. Her silken cloth seemed like the solarsplendour on the summit of a mountain; and herself besidethe sable Rākshasa, looked like the lightning in the welkin(beside clouds). From your relation of Rāma, I conclude thatshe must be Sitā. Now listen to me as I tell you about theabode of that Rākshasa. Son unto Viçravana and brotherunto Vaiçravana, the Rākshasa named Rāvana resides in thecity of Lankā. And the lovely city of Lankā, reared byViçwakarma, lieth a full hundred yojanas hence on an islandin the sea; furnished with golden gateways, filled withvariegated daises, lordly gold-gleaming palaces; and girt roundwith great walls hued like sunshine. There stayeth Vaidehi,forlorn and clad in a silken cloth,—confined in the innerapartment of Rāvana, and carefully guarded by Rākshasis.In Lankā protected all round by the sea, ye shall beholdJanaka's daughter, Maithili. At the end of the ocean after afull hundered yojanas, arriving at its southern shore, ye shallsee Rāvana. Ye monkeys, do ye hie thither speedily withvigor. I perceive by my knowledge that having seen (thatplace), ye shall come back. The first course belongs tofork-tailed shrikes and others living on grain; the second, tothose that live on animals and fruits; the third is ranged byBhāshas; the fourth by Kraunchas, Kuvaras and hawks; thefifth by vultures; the sixth belongs to swans endowed withyouth and beauty; and the next to the Vainateyas. We havederived our origin from Vainateya.183 (By despatching youthither), I shall avenge the heinous deed perpetrated by thecannibal, as well as the wrong done by Rāvana unto mybrother. Resting here, I see Rāvana and Jānaki. We haveexcellent Sauparna184 clairvoyance. For this reason, as wellas owing to the energy consequent on our feeding oncertain kinds of flesh, we, ye monkeys, can see a littlefurther than an hundred yojanas. Therefore (the Deity) hathordained such food for us as are fraught with the power ofmaking one see from a great distance. And the abode ofcocks and others being underneath trees, their sight is limitedto the extent which they require to see. Do ye look aboutfor means to cross over the salt waters. Having met withVaidehi, do ye, having achieved success, come back. I wishto be taken by you to the ocean—abode of Varuna. I willoffer water unto (the manes of) my high-souled brother,who hath gone to heaven.\" Thereat those heroes, themonkeys possessed of exceeding energy, carried to thedestined spot on the shore of the ocean, Sampāti, whosewings had been scathed. Then carrying that lord ofvultures back to the self-same place, the monkeys, furnished withinformation (concerning Sitā), experienced great joy."

And who hath carried awayMithilā's daughter? Do thou tell ue all about this, and(thus) prove the path of those rangers of the woods. Whois there that doth not take heed of the force of Dāçarathi's185and Lakshmana's arrows, speeding with the vehemence ofthunder?\" Thereat, cheering up those monkeys, who hadrisen from their attitudes of fasting, and who were allattention to hear news concerning Sitā, he (Sampāti), wellpleased, said these words,—\"Listen as to how I came toknow of the ravishment of Vaidehi, Sitā, at this place; andwho it was that told me where that one of expansive eyesis. For a long time I lay here, old, and of feeble life andenergy. That best of birds, my son named Supārçwa,coming to me, at the proper hour maintained me with food.Gandharbas are exceedingly lascivious; serpents areexceedingly wrathful; fear is excessive in deer; and we haveexcessive hunger. Once on a time my son, going forth aboutsunrise to procure food for me who was suffering fromhunger and (accordingly) eager for it, came back in theevening without any flesh. Hurt (by my speech uttered)in consequence of my non-receipt of food, that enhancerof my joy, asking my forgiveness, said these words fraughtwith fact,—'Father, taking to my wings at the proper timefor procuring flesh, I (went) and stood, obstructing the passof the Mahendra mountain. There stood I looking down,obstructing the way of thousands of creatures ranging the sea.There I saw somebody resembling a mass of crushedcollyrium, going away, taking a female resembling the rising sunin splendour. Seeing them, I had made up my mind thatthey should serve for thy fare, when he humbly in a pacificmanner begged for way. Even among the mean, there isnone on earth that can slay people who assume a mildattitude. What shall I say, alas! of superior ones likemyself? And summoning celerity, he went on as if pushingoff the sky by his energy. Then the rangers of the air andother beings worshipped me. And the Maharshis said untome,—By luck it is that Sitā is still living186 —He togetherwith a female, having passed by thee, certainly augurs goodfortune unto thee.187 —Then those eminently handsome Siddhasspoke thus unto me.—This is Rāvana, the king of theRākshasas, said they unto me. And I (stood), beholding thewife of Rāma, son unto Daçaratha,—throwing off herornaments and silken apparel, overwhelmed by might of sorrow,with hair dishevelled crying out the names of Rāma andLakshmana. This O father, is the reason of my passing thetime.' That best of those skilled in speech, Supārçwa, saidall this unto me. Even hearing of this, I could not thinkof putting forth prowess. How can a bird bereft of wings,undertake any thing? But listen! I will tell you as to whatI am capable of through speech, intellect and merit, andwhat ye can exert your manliness in. I will do what isagreeable unto you by my words and my intention. Thatwhich is Dāçarathi's work is also mine. Of this there is nodoubt. Ye, foremost in intelligence, strong, intellectual,and incapable of being overcome by the gods themselves,have been despatched by the monarch of monkeys. AndRāma's and Lakshmana's shafts furnished with the feathersof the Kanka, are competent to afflict or save the threeworlds. And although the Ten-necked one is endowed withstrength and energy, yet to you who are competent, nothingis hard to accomplish. There is no need of delay. Make upyour minds. Persons like you do not give way to lazinessin enterprise.\""

My bodybeing affected by solar heat, and my wings burnt by therays of the sun, O sinless one, I formerly fell to this summitof Vindhya. On regaining my senses after six nights, duringwhich I was insensible, I looked around in bewilderment,but could not recognise anything whatever. Then closelyviewing oceans and mountains, rivers and tanks, and woodsand countries, my thoughts came back to me. And seeingthis place abounding in cheerful birds, containing woods andcrested with summits, I for certain concluded it to be Vindhyaon the shores of the Southern sea. And here lay a sacredasylum, honored even by the celestials, and here dwelt asaint named Niçākara, of fierce austerities. And afterNiçākara cognizant of virtue had gone to heaven, I bereftof that saint, passed eight thousand years in this mountain.Descending with difficulty from the uneven top of Vindhya,I again came188 to the earth covered with sharp-pointed grass.I was eager to see the saint; and (therefore), with much adoI came to him; and Jatāyu and myself saw that saint manya time and oft. A fragrant breeze blew about the hermitage;and no tree was found that did not bear flowers and fruits.Approaching the holy asylum, I, desirous of beholding theworshipful Niçākara, waited at the foot of a tree. Then ata distance I saw the saint, flaming in energy andirrepressible,—returning northwards. And as creatures gather rounda giver, bears and Srimaras, tigers, lions, and variousreptiles, were going along, surrounding him. And knowingthat the saint had arrived (at his home), the animals wentaway, as go away forces together with counsellors, when thesovereign hath entered (his palace).—The saint was glad onseeing me. Then re-entering his asylum for a short space,he came out and enquired for my mission. 'O mild one, inconsequence of thy feathers having undergone alteration, Icannot recognise thee. Thy two wings have been blastedby fire; and thy powers in thy frail frame are (in the samecondition). Aforetime I saw two vultures like unto wind inspeed,—kings of vultures, brothers, wearing shapes at will.Thou art I know, elder, O Sampāti; and Jatāyu is younger tothee. Assuming human forms, you had taken hold of my feet.Now, what ailment hath attacked thee? And why have thyplumes fallen off? And who hath dealt this punishment untothee? Do thou tell all this unto me, who am asking thee'.\""

And mygetting (back) my wings inspires (us) with confidence as tosuccess.\" Having said this unto all the monkeys, that rangerof the sky and best of birds. Sampāti, anxious to ascertainhis power of flight, flew up from the mountain summits.Hearing his words, those powerful monkeys, with vigour(enhanced), seeing success before them, felt the height of joy.Then those foremost of monkeys, in vigor resembling theWind, getting occasion for displaying their prowess, intentwpon searching the Janaka's daughter, set forward towards thequarter crested by Abhijit.198"

  "Āranya, Kishkindhā, and Sundara Kāndam": "Having heard all this related to them by thevulture-king, the monkeys possessing the strength of lions, filled withdelight, bounded and set up a roar. Hearing from Sampātithat Rāvana was to be slain, the monkeys growing glad,came to the ocean, with the desire of seeing Sitā. Andcoming to that country, these ones prossessing dreadfulprowess, beheld (the sea) reflecting the image of this entiremighty world. And arriving at the northern side of theSouthern sea, those exceedingly powerful heroic monkeystook up their quarters there. And seeing the sea, here as ifasleep, there, as if playful, and at another place with surgesmeasuring mountains; and thronged with the foremostDānavas inhabiting the nether regions; and capable of causingone's hair to stand on end, those powerful monkeys wereseized with sadness. And seeing the sea, incapable of beingcrossed even as the sky, all the monkeys began to lament,saying,—\"What is to be done?\" And that best of monkeys—(Angada), seeing the army cast down because of the sightof the sea, began to comfort the monkeys, afflicted withfear. \"We should not indulge in grief. Grief is injurious.—Grief destroys a person even as a wrathful serpent doth aboy. He that, when the time is come for displaying hisprowess, indulges in sorrow, growing weak in energy, failsto attain his object.\" That night having passed away, Angadain company with the monkeys, joined by the old ones, againtook counsel with them. And that monkey-host surroundingAngada, resembled the host of Maruts environing Vāsava.Who save Vāli's son (stationed) at one place and at anotherHanumān, could be capable of stilling that force? Thensaluting the elders as well as the army, the graceful Angada—repressor of foes—spoke words fraught with sense,—\"Whatperson, endued with exceeding energy, shall now leap over themain? Who shall serve that subduer of enemies, Sugriva, everintent on truth? What monkey can leap over an hundredyojanas? Who shall deliver leaders of herds from a mightyfear? By whose favor shall we, crowned with success andrendered happy, returning from this place, shall behold ourwives and our sons, and our homes? By whose favor shallwe joyfully meet Rāma, and the mighty Lakshmana, and thatdweller in the woods, Sugriva? If any monkey among you iscompetent to bound over the deep, let him at once confer onus Dakshinā in the shape of deliverance from fear.\" HearingAngada's speech, none said anything. And that host ofmonkeys wavered. Then that foremost of monkeys againaddressed those monkeys, saying,—All of you are theforemost of strong ones, and of steady prowess. And ye havesprung in blameless lines, and are ever honored (by the king).And yet no one of you can promise to undertake thisjourney? Ye best of monkeys, unfold your respective powersin bounding.\""

  "Āranya, Kishkindhā, and Sundara Kāndam": "Hearing Angada's speech, those foremost monkeysone after another began to speak, touching their respectivecompetence in coursing—Gaya, and Gavāksha, and Gavaya,and Sarabha, and Gandhamādana, and Mainda, and Dwivida,and Angada, and Jambavān. And Gaya said.—\"I can leapover ten yojanas\" And Gavāksha said,—\"I shall go twentyyojanas\" And the monkey Sarabha said to thosemonkeys,—\"Ye monkeys, I shall go thirty yojanas.\" Andthe monkey, Rhishava, said to those monkeys,—\"I shall,without doubt, go forty yojanas\" And the exceedinglyenergetic monkey, Gandhamādana, said,—\"I shall, for certaingo fifty yojanas.\" And the monkey Mainda said unto themonkeys there,—\"I shall undertake to leap over sixtyyojanas.\" And then the highly energetic Dwivida said,—\"I shall,for certain, go seventy yojanas. And the highly powerfulSushena, possessed of strength—foremost of monkeys said—\"I declare that in motion I am equal to eighty yojanas.\" Asthey were speaking thus, the oldest of them all, Jambavān,saluting them, answered—\"Formerly we had power of motion.But now we have waxed exceeding old. Although this is so,yet we can not overlook this, as both Rāma and themonkey-king (by sending us) have become sure of success. At presentdo thou understand the course that is ours. I shall go ninetyyojanas. There is no doubt whatever about this.\" Jambavānsaid this unto those choice monkeys. But (formerly) myprowess in leaping was forsooth not such.199 Of oldin the sacrifice of Virochana's son, the eternal Lord Vishnu,when he had covered the entire universe with three steps,was circumambulated by me. But I who was all this, havewaxed old, and my vigor sits feebly upon me. In my youth,however, my strength was exceeding great and incomparable.Now I can only by my own energy, course thus far. Butsuch a bound shall not bring success on our undertaking.After this, saluting the mighty monkey, Jambavān, the wiseAngada spoke straight sense, saying,—\"I can go over thismighty hundred yojanas; but there is no certainty as to mypower of returning.\" Thereat, Jambavān, cognizant of speech,said unto that foremost of monkeys,—\"O foremost of leonineones, we know thy power of motion, thou art capable ofcoursing a hundred thousand yojanas, as well as of comingback. But we say that even this is what is fit. My child,the master must on no account be commanded by his servants.O foremost of monkeys, all these should be commandedby thee. Thou art our spouse, and (at the same time)occupying the position of our husband. The master is the spouseof the army. This is the way of the world, O repressor offoes! O subduer of enemies, thou art the root of thisbusiness. Therefore, my child, thou shouldest always bemaintained by us like a wife. The root of any work mustbe preserved. This is the policy of those versed in business.The root existing, all the virtues, obtaining fruit, certainlymeet with suceess. Thou, O thou having truth for prowessart the instrument of this undertaking, and, O subduer ofenemies, furnished with sense and vigor, thou art the occasionherein. And, O foremost of monkeys, thou art both oursuperior, and our superior's son; and resorting to thee weare enabled to accomplish our object.\" Thereat that mightymonkey, Angada, son unto Vāli, answered the exceedinglywise Jambavān, when he had spoken,—\"If I go not, nor anyother powerful monkey, then we should for certain again sitourselves down to fast unto death. Without doing themandate of the intelligent lord of monkeys, we, repairing thither,shall not behold ourselves alive. He is extreme both inshowing favor and in anger. Disregarding his order, we shall,going there, meet with destruction And his ire shall, nottake any other course. Therefore it behoves thee, capableof seeing issues, to reflect.\" Thus addressed by Angadathat powerful and heroic monkey Jambavān answered Angadain excellent words, saying,—\"That business, O hero, shallnot moult a feather. I shall despatch even him who shallbring about success.\"—Then that heroic monkey ordered theforemost of monkeys, the highly heroic monkey Hanumān,who stood apart, convinced (of the wisdom of Jambavān'sdecision.)"

  "Āranya, Kishkindhā, and Sundara Kāndam": "Surveying the monkey-host consisting of many hundredsand thousands,—crest-fallen, Jambavān thus spake untoHanumān,—\"O hero among the monkey-multitude, bestof those versed in all branches of learning, staying apart insilent, why dost thou not speak? O Hanumān, thou art alikein energy and strength, equal to Sugriva, monarch ofmonkeys, and to Rāma and Lakshmana. Arishtanemi's son,the mighty Vainateya,200 famous by the cognomen of Garutroin,is the foremost of birds. Many a time and oft I have seenthat exceedingly powerful, mighty-armed one, endowed withstrength of will,—raise up serpents in the ocean. Thestrength that is in his wings is equal to the might and virtue ofthy arm. Thy energy and prowess are not surpassed by him.And thy strength, and thy understanding, thy energy, andthy vigour, O foremost of monkeys, (is known among allcreatures). Why dost not thou prepare thyself furnished witheverything that is noble or great, (for this feat)? Thatforemost of Apsarās,—the famous Punjikathalā, more famed underthe name of Anjanā, is the spouse of the monkey Kesarin.Famed over the three worlds, and incomparable on earth byvirtue of her beauty, by an imprecation, my son, she wasborn in the monkey-race, capable of wearing shapes at herwill. Once on a time, that daughter of the high-souled lordof monkeys, Kunjara,—endeued with youth and beauty,—decked in a delightful garland, and clad in silk,—assuming a human form, was ranging on the summit of a mountain,resembling a mass of clouds in the rainy season. And it cameto pass that as that one of expansive eyes was standing on thesummit of the mount, the Wind gently stole away her elegantyellow cloth with crimson skirts. And he had a sight of herfair and fine face, together with her well-developed breasts.And soon as the Wind saw that illustrious one of spaciouships and slender waist, and whose every limb was lovely,—he was amain overcome by desire. And all his framepossessed by Manmatha, and deprived of self, the Windembraced that blameless one by means of his long arms.Thereat, influenced by fear, that one of excellent vows said,—'Who is it that desireth to lay violent hands upon mychastity?' Hearing Anjanā's words, the Wind answered,—'I do not wrong thee, O thou of shapely hips. Let notfear enter thy heart. As, O famous damsel, by embracingthee, I have mentally entered into thy womb, thou shaltbear a son, intelligent and endeued with prowess. And,gifted with great strength, and possessing exceeding energy,and having vast vigor, he shall equal me inbounding and leaping.' Thus addressed, O mighty monkey, thymother, O long-armed one, O foremost of monkeys, gavebirth to thee in a cave. And in that mighty forest, thou, achild, desirous of eating, seeing the Sun risen, and takinghim to be a fruit, sprang up and leaped into the sky. And, Omighty monkey, going three thousand yojanas, thou, struck byhis energy, didst not feel poverty of spirit. And, seeing theerushing through the heavens, O mighty monkey, Indra,growing wroth, hurled his thunder-bolt at thee. Thereat,breaking thy left jaw, thou (didst fall) on the mountain-top.From this circumstance, thy name hath been known asHanumān.201 Witnessing thee beaten back, that bearer ofperfumes himself, the Wind, that breaketh everything before him.in wrath did not blow through the three worlds. Thereat, all thegods—lords of the universe—influenced by fear inconsequence of the triune world waxing agitated, began to pacifythe wrathful Wind. And on the Wind being mollified, Brahmāconferred on him a boon, saying,—'O child, O thou of trueprowess, (thy son) shall be incapable of being slain in battleby means of weapons.' And seeing him202 sustain no(serious) injury consequent on the impact of the thunder-bolt,He of a thousand eyes, pleased in his soul, also conferredon (thee) an excellent boon, O lard, saying,—'Thy death shalltake place according to thy will.' Thou, endowed withdreadful vigor, art the son of Kesari by his wife; and, resemblingthe Wind in energy, thou hast sprung from his loins. Thouart the son of the Wind, my child—equal to him in thepower of leaping. Now we are without our lives. And nowthou, endowed with dexterity and vigor, and like another kingof the monkeys,203 art before us. On the occasion of Vishnu'senveloping the earth with three steps, I, O child, hadcircumambulated the earth with her mountains, woods and forests,one and twenty times. Then, commissioned by the gods, wehad gathered annuals, which being cast on the deep, causedambrosia to come out after churning. At that time, greatwas our strength. But now I have grown old, and myprowess hath left me. At present we have thee, furnishedwith every virtue. Therefore, possessed of vigor, do thoubestir thyself, and bound over (the main). Thou art the mostqualified of all. This entire monkey host is eager to beholdthy prowess. O redoubtable monkey, do thou arise! Dothou leap over the mighty ocean. Thy motion, Hanumān,surpasseth that of all beings. All the monkeys are depressed.Why, O Hanumān, dost thou overlook this? Put forth thyvigor, O thou endowed with mighty vehemence, like Vishnucrossing over the three worlds in three steps.\" Exhorted bythe foremost of monkeys, that one famed for his speech, thatmonkey,the offspring of the Wind-god, gladdening themonkey-hosts, wore (a fit) shape for crossing the ocean.204"

  "Āranya, Kishkindhā, and Sundara Kāndam": "Seeing that foremost of monkeys enlarge his person forcrossing over an hundred yojanas, and suddenly filled withenergy,(the monkeys) at once renounced sorrow, and, filled withdelight, set up ululations and fell to eulogizing the mightyHanumān. And, struck with amazement,they, (staying) all round,joyfully gazed (at him); even as creatures beheld Nārāyana,when stretching forth his three steps, he preparedhimself (for the succeeding feat). And, eulogized by them, thewondrous mighty Hanumān increased; and, flourishing his tailfrom joy, attained strength. And as, extolled by the principalelderly monkeys, he became fraught with effulgence, his beautywas great. As a lion fills himself with vigor in an opencave, so the son of the Wind-god filled himself with energy.And the face of him, as that intelligent one was filling himselfwith force, was aflame like a frying-pan, or like untofumeless fire. Rising in the midst of the monkeys, Hanumānwith his down standing on end through joy, saluting theaged monkeys, said,—\"Wind, the friend of Fire, shatterethmountain-summits; and, ever blowing in the eye of thesky, he is possessed of strength, and is of immeasurable(might). Begot from his loins, I am the son of thefast-coursing and high-souled Wind, coursing swiftly. Iam his equal in all these accomplishments205. I can,without once stopping, circumambulate the extensive andheaven-cleaving mountain, Meru, for a thousand times.And, dashing the ocean with my arms, I can delugethe world with its mountains, rivers and lakes. Lashedby the force of my legs and thighs, that abode of Varuna,the sea, out which have sprung the ferocious aquaticanimals, overleaps its continents. And for once that lord ofbirds, Vinatā's offspring, living on serpents, courseth throughthe welkin, I can course through it a thousand times. And Ican touch the flaming effulgent Sun ere, beginning his journeyfrom the Rising hill, he ascends the Setting hill. And, yeforemost of monkeys, I can, fiercely rushing on, come againwithout touching the earth. And I can bound beyond starsand planets, suck up the oceans, and rive the earth. Anda monkey, I can, leaping, crush mountains; and, leaping, Ican drain the mighty ocean dry. And, when I shall leap inthe sky, flowers from various shrubs and trees shall followme to-day. And then my course, (flecked with flowers), shallresemble even the sky (studded with stars). And, yemonkeys, then all creatures shall see me, now ranging throughthe profound firmament, now shooting up, and nowdescending on the other shore). Resembling Mahāmeru, me yeshall behold, ye monkeys, making my way, covering up thesky, as if devouring up the heavens. I shall, leaping andconcentrating my energy, scatter the clouds, shake the hills,and suck up the ocean. The strength of Vinatā's son, orthe Wind-god's, or mine, (surpasses that of every othercreature). None save the sovereign of birds, or the exceedinglymighty Wind, can follow me in flight. In the twinkling ofan eye I shall spread through the unsupported sky, likelightning darting from clouds. And at the time of leapingover the ocean, my form shall resemble that of the energizingVishnu, when He had assumed the triune energy. I perceivethrough my intelligence, (and my mental motion tallies), thatI shall behold Vaidehi. Therefore, ye monkeys, rejoice. Invehemence like unto Garuda, I shall, I conceive, go anAyuta yojanas. I can, suddenly summoning energy, bringhither ambrosia from the very grasp of Vāsava or Brahmā,himself.206 I shall leap sheer over Lankā. Even this is myimpression.\" Filled with delight, the monkeys there amazedsee that foremost of monkeys, endued with immeasurablemight, storming. And, hearing his speech capable of removingthe grief of kindred, that best of monkeys Jambavān,transported with joy, said,—\"O hero! O son of Kesari! Ooffspring of the Wind! the huge sorrow of thy kindred hath,my child, been destroyed by thee. And these foremost ofmonkeys assembled, who wish for thy welfare, shall, withintent minds, perform acts tending to thy weal,—so that thoumayst succeed in thy undertaking. And by the grace of thesaints, and with the permission of the aged monkeys, and bythe blessing of the superiors, do thou bound over the mightymain. Till thou return, we shall stay on one leg.207 Thelives of all these rangers of the forest shall go along withthee.\" Then that tiger-like monkey said unto those rangersof the woods,—\"None in this world would be able to sustainmy impetus in the act of bounding. Here are these summits,firm and spacious, of this mountain, Mahendra, thronged withcrags. I shall rush forward from these summits of Mahendra,interspersed with trees and adorned with masses of ore.And as I leap over a hundred yojanas, these mighty summitsshall sustain my impetus.\" Then he equalling the Wind, thatmonkey, the son of the Wind-god, pounder of enemies,ascended that best of mountains, Mahendra; covered withvarious trees and flowers, furnished with swards; ranged bydeer; containing plants and blossoms with trees bearingfruits and flowers daily; having tigers and lions andinfuriated elephants; swarming with maddened birds;and abounding with fountains. Ascending (Mahendra), thatforemost of monkeys endeued with exceeding strength, andresembling Mahendra himself in prowess, began to range fromone mighty summit to another. Thereat, hurt by the arms ofthat high-souled one, that mighty mountain began to cry,208like a mighty mad elephant tormented by a lion. And waterrushed out of masses of rocks scattered around. And thatmighty mountain had its deer and elephants afflicted withafright; and its giant trees shaken: and its spaciousuplands deserted by various Gandharva couples engaged indrinking and dalliance, and by birds flying away, and bybevies of Vidyādharas; and its huge serpents distressed, andits cliffs and peaks toppling down. And with its serpentshissing, with their bodies half issuing (from their holes), themountain seemed as if it shone with pennons displayed. Andthe heap of crags forsaken by saints exercised with fearand agitation, looked doleful, like a wayfarer left in a vastforest by his companions. And that intelligent, magnanimousand heroic monkey—destroyer of hostile heroes,—endowedwith speed, concentrating his soul on his energy, mentallywent to Lankā."

  "Āranya, Kishkindhā, and Sundara Kāndam": "Then that repressor of foes209 resolved to follow the pathof the Chāranas, in quest of the place where Sitā was carriedoff by Rāvana. And bent on achieving a hard task, inwhich he had no help-mate and none to withstand the monkey,with his neck and head raised, resembled the lord of kine.210And frightening fowls, and crushing trees with his breast,and slaughtering numbers of beasts, that exceedinglypowerful, intelligent and staid one began to range at ease inlapis-hued lawns resembling water, like a lion bursting in energy.And on the level of that foremost of mountains, filled withnonpareil Nāgas, and embellished with natural and unmixedmetals, red and dark-blue, and black and pale, and pale-red,and lotus-hued, and variegated; and crowded with god-likeYakshas and Kinnaras and Gandharvas and Pannagas,excellently attired,—Hanumān stationing himself, resembleda Nāga in a lake. Then joining his hands to the Sun,Mahendra, Wind,211 the Self-create, and all Beings, he set hisheart upon his journey. Then having,with his face to the East,joined his palms to his Sire, that blessed one began to attainproportions for journeying towards the South. And sureas the sea increases on the occasion of a Parva, (Hanumān)determined on his leap, experiencing exhilaration, began, inthe midst of the foremost monkeys, to increase for the behoofof Rāma. Attaining measureless magnitude, he desirous ofcrossing over the ocean, pressed the mountain with his armsand legs. And roughly handled by the monkey, the mountainanon shook for a while; and all the blossoms showered downfrom the tops of the trees. And covered all over with heapsof fragrant flowers thrown off from the trees, the entiremountain wore one floral look. And afflicted by that one offirst-rate prowess, that mountain shed water, like an elephantin rut. And hard beset by that powerful one, the mountainMahendra put out the golden, silvern and collyrium sheen(that appertained thereto). And the mountain beganto cast forth huge crags containing red arsenic; and itsmiddle resembled smoke embosoming a sparkling flame.And sore tormented by the monkey engaged in harassingthem, all the creatures dwelling in the caverns cried infrightful tones. And that mighty chorus212 of the creaturesconsequent on the mountain's agony filled the entireearth, all the cardinal points, and the groves. And snakesbringing out their spacious hoods marked with blue streaks,vomitting fierce fire, began to bite at the rocks with theirfangs. And those gigantic crags, bit at by those enraged(snakes) of virulent venom, flamed up with fire and wereshivered unto a thousand fragments. And those medicinalherbs that grew there, albeit endowed with the virtue ofneutralizing poison, could not tame the fierceness of thevenom of those serpents. Then, conceiving that the mountainwas being riven by Brahma Rākshasas, the ascetics,becoming agitated, as well as the Vidyādharas together with theirfemales, began to flee away. And forsaking their goldenseats and cans on the drinking grounds, and costly vessels,and water-pots plated with gold, and diverse suckable viandsand meats of various kinds, and bucklers of bull hides,gold-hafted swords,—beings with wreathes on their necks, inebriate,bearing red garlands and unguents, having red eyesresembling lotuses, flew into the firmament. And fair ones deckedin chains and bangles and Keyuras and bracelets,213 struckwith amaze, with a smile rose in the sky along with theirparamours. And witnessing this mighty phenomenon,Vidyadharas and Maharshis, mounted into the sky, gazing atthe mountain. And they heard the words of spirit-pervadedascetics, and Chāranas, and Siddhas, stationed in the azuresky: \"This mountain-like Hanumān, son of the Wind,endeued with exceeding vehemence, is anxious to cross overthe main—abode of Varuna. And undertaking an arduoustask in the interests of Rāma and monkeys, this one wishesto go to the other shore of the sea hard to reach.\"Hearing this speech of the ascetics, the Vidyādharas sawin the mountain that foremost of monkeys ofimmeasurable might. And that one resembling fire shook and bristledhis down; and he set up a tremendous roar resembling amighty (rumbling) cloud. And springing up, he lashed histail furnished all over with hair and folds, like the king ofbirds handling a serpent. And the tail of that one enduedwith exceeding impetus, bent and brandished, seemed likea gigantic serpent carried off by Garuda. And the monkeyplanted his arms resembling mighty clubs, fast (on themountain); and his waist became slender; and his legs werecontracted. And contracting his arms214 and neck, thatgraceful and powerful one summoned energy, and strength,physical and mental. And looking at his way from a distance,Hanumān, raising his eyes up, and fixing his gaze at thesky, suspended his breath in his breast. And planting hisfeet firmly, that one endowed with mighty strength, Hanumān,foremost of monkeys, contracting his ears up, sprang forward;and that best of monkeys spoke unto the monkeys, saying,—\"As a shaft shot by Rāghava, courses like the wind, so willI course to Lankā ruled by Rāvana. And if I fail to findJanaka's daughter in Lankā, I shall with the self-same speedrepair to the regions of the celestials. And if I do not findSitā in Lankā, after taking so much trouble, I shall bringthe Rākshasa king bound. Either attaining complete success,I shall come hither (back); or uprooting Lankā, with Rāvanain it, I shall carry it hither.\" Having observed this, themonkey Hanumān, foremost of monkeys, endowed withspeed, without pausing for thought, suddenly sprang up.And that powerful monkey deemed himself like unto Suparna.And as he flew up, the trees situated in that mountain, inconsequence of his violent rush, shrinking their boughs, rolledover on all sides. And drawing up blossoming trees filledwith maddened lapwings, by the vehemence of his flight,he coursed on in the clear sky. And those trees borne upby the vehemence of his flight, followed the monkey fora while, like friends following a friend that hath set out fora far country. And pulled up by the impetus of his (rushing)thighs, Sālas and other mighty trees followed Hanumān,as an army follows its monarch. And surrounded byinnumerable trees having their tops crested with flowers, Hanumānwearing a mountain-like appearance, was wonderful tobehold. And those trees that were more ponderous, plungedinto the salt sea, as plunged the mountains into Varuna'sabode, afflicted with the fear of Mahendra.215 And strewnwith various sprouts and buds and blossoms, the monkeyresembling a mass of clouds, looked lovely like a hill filledwith glow-worms. And uprooted by the force of his rush,those trees, their flowers fallen off, plunged into the sea,like friends returning to their homes (after havingaccompanied their friend some way). And blown by the wind causedby the monkey, the various variegated flowers of the treesin consequence of their lightness, showered down onthe sea. And covered with heaps of fragrant flowers ofdiverse hues, the monkey resembled a mass of cloudsembellished by lines of lightning. And the waters (ofthe ocean) strewn with blossoms carried off by his motion,appeared like the sky garnished with charming stars (crestingthe same). And his arms stretched in the sky, seemed likefive-hooded snakes issuing from a mountain. And heappeared as if he was drinking up the mighty deep with itsmultitudes of waves, or as if that redoubtable monkey wasdesirous of sucking up the sky itself. And as he coursedthe orbit of air, his eyes flashing like lightning, resembledtwo craters216 aglow on a mountain. And the eyes of thatforemost of tawny-hued ones resembled the sun and the moonstationed in a vast yellow aureola. And beside his copperynose, his face looked coppery, as looks the solar disc on theapproach of eve. And the uplifted tail of the Wind-god'soffspring engaged in bounding, appeared beautiful in thesky like the raised standard of Sakra. And the exceedinglywise son of the Wind, Hanumān, having white teeth, withhis tail coiled up, looked handsome like the sun with hisdisc. And on account of his waist being deeply coppery,that mighty monkey appeared like a mountain running amighty torrent mixed with minerals and red chalk. Andthe wind that had got into the armpits of that leonine monkeywho was crossing over the main, roareth like clouds. Andas a meteor consisting of many smaller ones, darting fromabove falleth down (to the earth), rushed on that foremostof monkeys. And then that stalwart monkey resemblingthe careering sun, resembled a mad elephant fettered bythe middle, whose bulk has increased immensely. Andas he coursed above, on account of the reflection cast byhis body (on the bosom of the deep), the monkey217 lookedlike a bark swayed by the breeze. And wherever that mightymonkey went about the sea, the state of things appeared toundergo a violent convulsion owing to impetus imparted byhis body. And that mighty monkey possessed of exceedingspeed, rushed on, raising multitudes of surges on the seaby his breast resembling rock. And the wind begot of themonkey as well as that of the clouds, issuing out, made thedread-sounding ocean roll violently. And pushing upmultitudes of high-heaving billows from the salt waters, thattiger-like monkey rushed on, separating earth and heaven.And that one endeued with vehement speed passed oversurges in the mighty main resembling Mandara or Meru; asif counting them218. And the waters lashed up to the cloudsby the force (of his speed), looked like autumnal cloudsoverspreading the sky. And then whales and alligators andfishes and tortoises appeared plainly visible, like the personsof individuals, when the cloth hath been taken off them. Andsea-serpents, seeing that tiger-like monkey proceeding inthe sky, took him for Suparna himself. And the shadow of theleonine monkey, measuring ten yojanas in width and thirtylength, seemed the more handsome in consequence of hisdeed. And that shadow resembling masses of white clouds,falling on the salt waters and following the wind-god's son,seemed exceedingly beautiful. And that exceedingly energeticmighty monkey possessed of a gigantic body, appearedsplendid in the unsupported aerial way, like a wingedmountain. And the deep beside the course that was beingvehemently pursued by that elephantine monkey, was suddenlyturned into a water-course.219 And coursing through the regionsof fowls like the monarch of the feathered race, Hanumān,pushing away masses of clouds, resembled the wind himself,And collossal clouds scattered by the monkey, pale andcrimson and blue and mangistha-hued, looked exceedingly lovely,And now entering into the clouds, and now emerging fromthem, he looked like the moon, sometimes hid and sometimesvisible. And beholding that monkey engaged in boundingwith celerity, gods, Gandharbas and Dānavas began to strewblossoms (on him). And as he was leaping,the Sun did not burnhim; and the Wind ministered unto him, for the success ofRāma's work. And the saints hymned his praises, as he wasleaping on in the sky. And applauding the ranger of forests,they raised the voice of song. And nagas and Yakshas, andvarious (races of) Rākshasas, eulogized (him), on beholdingthat tiger-like monkey, Hanumān, in the act of bounding.And Hanumān, that lord of monkeys, being engaged in theact of bounding, the Ocean, wishing glory unto the race ofthe Ikshwākus, thought within himself, \"Truly shall I beblamed of all persons if I do not assist this lord of monkeys—Hānuman. Reared I have been by Sagara, the foremost of therace of the Ikshwākus—and this monkey is their counsellor.It therefore doth not behove me to tire him out. It becomethme to do that by which the monkey may take rest in me and,relieved, may happily traverse the remaining way.\" Havingarrived at this wholesome resolution, the Ocean spake untothat best of mountains, Maināka, hued in gold and situate inthe waters, saying, \"O lord, thou hast been placed here by theking of celestials as an outer gate against the Asurasinhabiting the region under the earth. Thou too, from then, hastbeen waiting at this gate, unapproachable by the Asuras,rising up again and again and whose prowess is well-known(unto the Lord of celestials). O mountain, thou art capableof expanding thyself upwards, downwards and on thy sides.I do command thee therefore, O best of mountains, to rise up.That best of monkeys, the energetic Hanumān, the performerof mighty deeds, engaged in Rāma's service, worn out withfatigue, waiteth above thee. Beholding the exhaustion ofthat leader of monkeys, it behoveth thee to rise up.\" Hearingthe speech of the Ocean, the golden mountain Maināka,covered with tall trees and creepers, rose up instantly fromhis watery bed. Like unto the Sun of bright rays rising outof the watery expanse, he uplifted himself from the Ocean.Being thus commanded by the Ocean, the great mountain,covered on all sides with water, immediately brought forthhis peaks. The sky was as if cleft by these golden summitslike unto the rising of the Sun, inhabited by Kinnaras andlarge Serpents. The golden summits of that mountain beingthus lifted up, the dark-blue sky assumed the golden hue.And by those highly resplendent golden peaks that best ofmountains assumed the brilliance of a thousand suns. Beholdingbefore him that up-heaved mountain in the midst of the saltOcean, Hanumān regarded it, as a barrier for aye. Like untoWind dispersing clouds, that mighty monkey with greatvelocity crushed down those up-lifted peaks with his breast. Beingthus crushed down by that monkey, the best of mountains,being apprized of his prowess, began to shout with joy.Thereupon, with a glad heart assuming the semblance of aman and stationing himself upon his own summit, thatmountain-chief addressed Hanumān, saying, \"O best ofmonkeys, forsooth hast thou been engaged in this arduoustask. Coming down on my peak do thou take rest. Thisocean was reared by one born in the family of Raghus. Andbeholding thee engaged on Rāma's behoof he is worshippingthee. The best and everlasting virtue consists in returningbenefits unto one who hath benefitted us. Bent on returningbenefits unto Raghu's race, he deserveth respect from thee.And to welcome thee properly I have been despatched byhim with the message—'Traversing over a hundred yojanasthis monkey hath been worn out with fatigue; let him voyageto the remaining way after resting for a while on thy summit.Do thou therefore, O best of monkeys, remain here and takerest. And feasting on these many fragrant and sweet fruitsand roots, O foremost of monkeys, do thou relieve thyselfof the toil and proceed. O leader of monkeys, my relationwith thee is replete with many virtues and known all overthe three worlds. O Son of Maruta, O best of monkeys, Iknow thee to be the foremost of all monkeys. Even anordinary guest should be adored by him who abideth by virtue,what of thee great as thou art? O thou lion among monkeys,thou art the son of Maruta, the foremost of celestials andart his equal in speed. Thou that art conversant with virtue,being worshipped, Maruta himself receiveth offerings. Thouart therefore worthy of my adoration. Hearken, there isanother reason for it. O worshipful one, in olden times,the mountains, gifted with wings, began to range all quarterswith velocity like unto Garuda. They moving thus, thecelestials, the asceties, and all creatures became almost faint withfear of their falling down. Highly enraged therefore, thethousand-eyed Deity, the performer of hundred sacrifices,sundered with his thunderbolt, the wings of hundreds andthousands of them. When with his thunderbolt, the Lordof celestials, wroth, approached me, I was all on a suddenthrown down by the high-souled Wind. O best of monkeysI was thus cast down in this salt ocean and preserved unhurtby thy ancestors having my wings hid. I shall thereforeadore thee and thou art object of my worship O Māruta!And this my relation with thee, O foremost of monkeys, ispregnant with many virtues. The time for returning benefitshaving arrived, O high-souled one, it behoveth thee to affordme and the ocean, satisfaction with a blessed heart. O bestof monkeys, relieve thyself of the fatigue and accept myaffectionate offerings, who am worthy of thy respect.220Happy am I to see thee.\" Being thus accosted by Maināka, thebest of mountains, Hanumān, the foremost of monkeys said,saying:—\"Pleased am I and thou hast shown me enough ofhospitality. Do thou give up thy wrath.221 Business wantsme to go soon and the time is well-nigh spent. Besides Ihave promised that I shall not halt at any intermediateplace.\" Thereupon touching the hill with his hand thathighly energetic monkey wended, smiling, his aerial way.Thereat the ocean and the mountain respectfully lookedtowards him and adored and welcomed him with blessingsworthy of the occasion. Leaving the mountain and theocean and rising high up, he proceeded in the clear welkintraversing the aerial way.222 Rising high up and casting hislook down on the hill, that foremost of monkeys proceededby the unsupported aerial track. Beholding this singularlyarduous work of Hanumān, the celestials, the Siddhas and theascetics all praised him. All the celestials and others livingon its summit, were highly pleased with the mountain arrayedin gold and having beautiful sides. And the thousand-eyedVasava was also pleased. And greatly pleased that highlyintelligent Sachi's lord, himself, addressed that best ofmountains having picturesque sides, saying:—\"Greatly delightedam I, O lord of mountains, O thou having golden peaks. 'Nofear' I do declare unto thee. Proceedest thou therefore, atthy ease, O gentle one! Greatly hast thou helped Hanumān,crossing fearlessly and unceasingly, over hundred yojanasto that he might not fall in danger. This monkey, is goiugin the interests of Rāma, Daçaratha's son—and thou hastwelcomed bin to the best of thy might. Therefore I amgreatly pleased with thee.\" Beholding that lord of celestialsthe performer or an hundred sacrifices, highly gratified, thatbest of mountains attained to an excess of joy. And havingreceived boons (from Indra) the Mountain occupied againits pristine place. And Hanumān in a short time crossedover the main. Thereupon the celestials along withGandharvas, Siddhas and the ascetics, spake unto Surasā themother of serpents, resembling the Sun, saying:—\"Thehighly effulgent son of Wind named Hanumān is crossingover the main. Thou art required to throw obstacles in hisway for a while. Assuming therefore the semblance of aterrible, grim-visaged Rākshasa, resembling a huge mountainand having terrible teeth and a face with coppery eyes, do thoutouch the welkin. We are anxious to learn if he defeateththee by some means or cometh by grief.\" Thus addressed theWorshipful Surasā, having been honored by the celestials,deformed and horrible and capable of exciting the fear of allbeings, and obstructing Hanumān as he was coursing on,said,—\"O foremost of monkeys, thou hast been ordained asmy fare by the gods themselves. I will eat thee up,—do thouenter my mouth. Even this is the boon that was conferred onme by the Deity.\" Having delivered herself thus speedily,the opening her mouth wide, stood before the son of thewind-god.\" Thus accosted by Surasā, (Hanumān) with aglad countenance, said,—\"Rāma, son unto Daçaratha, hadentered the Dandaka forest in company with his brother,Lakshmana, and his wife, Vaidehi. He having createdhostility with the Rākshasas, his illustrious wife, Sitā, whilehe was engrossed in some work, was carried away by Rāvana.At Rāma's command, I go to her as his envoy. It behoveththee, living in (Rāma's) dominions, to lend him thy help.Or having seen Mithilā's daughter, as well as Rāma ofuntiring deeds, I will enter thy mouth. This I promise theetruly.\" Thus addressed by Hanumān, Surasā, capable ofwearing forms at will, said,—\"None shall pass me withoutbeing devoured by me,—even this is the boon that I havereceived.\" Then seeing him go away, the mother of theNāgas, Surasā, derious of essaying the strength of Hanumān,spoke. \"O best of monkeys, thou shalt have to go, to-day,after entering my mouth. Even this is the boon that wasconferred on me by the Deity.\" Having said this swiftly,she extending her capacious mouth wide, stood in front ofthe wind-god's son. Thus addressed by Surasā, thatforemost of monkeys, waxing wroth, said,—\"Extend thy mouth so,that thou mayst contain me.\" Having said this unto Surasā,having her mouth measuring ten yojanas, Hanumān enlargedhimself as many yojanas. Thereat Surasā enlarged her monthtwenty yojanas. And beholding her223 extended mouth with along tongue, wondrous dreadful, like unto hill itself, andresembling clouds, measuring twenty yojanas, the intelligentson of the wind-god, Hanumān, enlarged, made himselfmeasure thirty yojanas. Threat, Surasā, extended hermouth forty yojanas, and thereupon the heroic Hanumānattained the altitude of fifty yojanas. And Surasā enlargedher mouth sixty yojanas; and the heroic Hanumān anonheightened himself seventy yojanas. And Surasā widenedher mouth eighty yojanas; and Hanumān like unto Fireraised himself ninety yojanas. And Surasā enlarged hermouth an hundred yojanas. Thereat diminishing his personlike unto a cloud, the wind-god's son at that momentmeasured one thumb only. Then entering her month andcoming out of it, that exceedingly powerful and gracefulone, stationing himself in the sky spoke thus. \"0descendant of Daksha, I have entered into thy mouth. Ibow down unto thee. I will repair to where Vaidehi is. Thyboon hath proved true. Seeing him out of her mouth likethe Moon out of the mouth of Rāhu, the venerable Surasāspoke unto the monkey in her native form, saying,—\"Forcompassing thy end, go, O foremost of monkeys, O mildone, at thine ease. And bringing unto Vaidehi tidingstouching the high-souled Rāghava do thou meet her.\"Witnessing that third act224 of Hanumān's hard to perform,all beings extolled the monkey exclaming, \"Excellent!Excellent!\" Then he, resembling the wind in rush, arrivedat the irrepressible ocean—abode of Varuna—went on,enveloping the welkin, on the aerial way, visited by showers,ranged by fowls and Gandharbas, graced by the iris;embellished by shining vehicles rolling on, drawn by lions, orelephants, or tigers, or bird-serpents; presided over byeminently pious and righteous persons who have wonthe regions of heaven; and therefore appearing as ifadorned by the (five) Fires; of the touch of Açani or Vayra;(ever) served by Fire bearing sacrificial oblations; garnishedby planets and stars and astral luminaries, and the Sunand the Moon; thronged with Maharshis, and Gandharbasand Nāgas, and Yakhas; and pure, and speckless;—thesupport of the universe—inhabited by Viçwāvasu; lordedover by the elephants of the king of the celestials; theorbit of the Sun and Moon, endowed with auspiciousnessconstituting the canopy of this live world; blameless; andmade by Brahmā; crowded with countless heroes, andVidyādharas. And the wind-god's son Hanumān, scatteringclouds like the very Wind himself, coursed on in the aerialway like Garuda. And mighty clouds, hued like Kālāguru225red, and yellow and sable, on being dispersed by the monkey,burst into brilliance. And again and again entering intothe clouds and emerging out of them, he resembled the Moonduring the rains now entering (into clouds) and now issuingout of them. And everywhere Hanumān, son unto thewind-god coursing through the unsupported sky, looked likethe monarch of mountains furnished with wings. And itcame to pass that beholding him in the act of bounding, aRākshasi named Sinhikā, of great age, and capable ofwearing forms at will, thought within herself,—\"Today after along lapse of time I shall have my fare. This mighty creaturehath after a long time come within my power.\" Havingthought thus in her mind, she seized (Hanumān's) shadow.226On his shadow being secured, the monkey reflected,—\"Asa mighty bark is retarded in its course in the sea byadverse wind, have I, my prowess paralysed, been suddenlyobstructed in my career.\" Then looking above and belowand sideways, the monkey saw a mighty creature arisenfrom the salt waters. And seeing that one of a distortedcountenace, the wind-god's son thought,—\"This one is,without doubt, the creature of wonderful form, possessed ofexceeding prowess,—given to securing its prey by meansof its shadow,—which had been described by the monkey-king.And concluding her to be Sinhikā, from her act,227 theintelligent monkey attaining a gigantic body, increased himself,like a mass of clouds during the rains. And seeing theenlarged body of the mighty monkey, she extended hermouth measuring the sky and the nether regions. Androaring like unto a mass of clouds, she rushed against the monkey.Thereat, that intelligent and mighty monkey marked herdeformed and huge mouth, her body and its asticulatedmembers. And the redoubtable monkey hard as the thunderbolt,contracting himself in a moment, threw himself into hermouth. And the Siddhas and Charanas saw him sink in hermouth, as the full Moon is taken by Rāhu during a Parva.—Then tearing her limits by means of his sharp claws, themonkey, endowed with the celerity of thought, vehementlysprang forward. Then slaying her by his acuteness ofsight, endurance and skill, that heroic, self-controlled monkeyagain began to swell himself amain. Her heart having beencrushed out by Hanumān, she, rendered lifeless, fell intothe water. The self-create had created him for compassingher destruction. And seeing Sinhikā speedily slain by themonkey, and fallen, creatures ranging the sky addressedthat foremost of monkeys, saying,—\"Terrible is the deedthat thou hast performed to day. Mighty was the creaturethat hath been slaughtered by thee. Compass thou thinewished-for end without let, O foremost of monkeys. He, Ochief of monkeys, that, like thee, is endowed with endurance,sharp sightedness, sense, and ability, doth not feel depressedin action.\" Honored by these and wished well as to hispurpose, that monkey, worthy of being honored, set out,enveloping the sky, like him that subsisteth on serpents.228And it came to pass that as he had almost arrived at theother shore (of the ocean), he looking about on all sides atthe end of an hundred yojanas saw a range of woods. Andas he went on. that best of monkeys saw an island deckedwith diverse trees, and groves pertaining Malaya. And hesurveyed the sea, and lands bordering thereon, and treesgrowing on the sea shore, and the countenances of thespouses of the Sea, And surveying his own personresembling a mighty mass of clouds, and as if closing up the sky,that self-possessed one ascertained his course of action.\"Soon as the Rākshasas shall behold my enlarged body andthe vehemence of my motion, they shall be seized withcuriosity concerning me.\" Thus thought that magnanimousone. Thereat diminishing that person of his resembling amountain, that self-possessed one, purged of ignorance,resumed his natural shape. And diminishing that form into thesmallest compass, Hanumān remained in his native form,like that depriver of Vāli's prowess, Hari, after he had placedhis three steps. And thus wearing various graceful forms,that one, acting after reflection, having come to the othershore of the ocean incapable of being reached by others,—on looking over his (immensely magnified person), reducedhis body (to its former size). And that high-souled oneresembling a cloudy pavilion, alighted on the (foremost)summit of the splendid mountain, Samva; crested withpicturesque peaks; and abounding in ketakas, uddālakas andcocoanuts. And reaching the shore of the sea, and beholdingLankā on the top of that foremost of mountains, the monkey,renouncing his native form, fell on that mountain, agitatingbirds and beasts. And having by main force bounded overthe ocean heaving with surges, and rife with Dānavas andPanagas, he alighting on the shore of the mighty main,beheld Lankā like unto Amarāvati."

  "Āranya, Kishkindhā, and Sundara Kāndam": "Having crossed over the ocean incapable ot beingrepressed, that one endowed with great strength, staying atthe plateau of Chitrakuta, and having refreshed himself, casthis eyes on Lankā. And covered with showers of blossomspoured down by the trees, that monkey possessed of prowessthen appeared there like Pushpamaya.229 And having clearedan hundred yojanas, that monkey gifted with first-rateprowess, did not heave sighs or feel any fatigue. \"I amcompetent to bound over many hundreds of yojanas. Whatthen is this end of the ocean measuring an hundred yojanasonly?\" And that foremost of those endowed with energyand the prime of monkeys,—gifted with speed, went toLankā,230 having crossed over the mighty main. And seeingblue lawns, and perfumed woods, replete with honey and filledwith mountains, he held his way by the central thoroughfare,And that foremost of monkeys, the energetic Hanumān, wentby hills filled with trees, and ranges of blossoming woods.And stationing himself in that mountain, the offspring of theWind-god beheld woods and groves and Lankā establishedat the brow of the mountain. And that elephant of a monkeysurveyed Saralas, and Karnikāras, and dates in full flower,Piyālas, Muchulindas, Kutajas and Ketakas, Piyanguswarm with aroma, and Nipas, and Saptachchhadas; Asanas,Kovidāras, and flowering Karaviras, and trees bearingblossoms, filled with swans and Kārandavas, and coveredwith lotuses and lilies; and charming sporting hills231 andvarious watery expanses; and extensive tracts coveredwith diverse trees bearing flowers and fruits at all seasons,and gardens exceedingly beautiful to behold. And drawingnear unto Lankā embellished with lilies and environed bya moat tilled with lotuses, that one graced withauspiciousness, that graceful monkey, Hanumān, beheld Lankā vigilantlyguarded by Rāvana, in consequence of Sitā having beencarried away,—with Rākshasas bearing fierce bows rangingall around,—that mighty and captivating capital surroundedby a golden wall, filled with edifices resembling cliffs andlooking like autumnal clouds, and elevated yellowishhighways; abounding in hundreds of banners mounted on thewalls, and beautified with pennons and streamers with noblegolden gateways painted with plants; and resembling themetropolis of the very sovereign of the celestials. And thatgraceful monkey saw Lankā situated on the top of themountain, filled with splendid yellow-white palaces, like untoa city stationed in the sky: ruled by the lord of Rākshasasand reared by Viçwakarmā himself. And the monkey,Hanumān, beheld Lankā, as if moving in the sky: with her wallsfurnished with daises for her hips, the immense waters andwoods for her cloth, Sataghnis and darts for her hair-ends:and pennons on her walls for ear-rings,—built as if by theagency of the Mind; and constructed by Viçwakarmā himself.And arriving at the Northern gate resembling the mansionof Kailāça, and cleaving, as it were, the welkin, and as ifholding the firmament with lofty and glorious edifices, andobserving the sea; his dreadful enemy, Rāvana; the cityteeming with poisonous snakes,—as well as the method ofdefence (displayed in it)—the monkey reflected,—\"Even ifthe monkeys came here, they should fail to achieve success;for Lankā is incapable of being taken in battle by thecelestials themselves. Even if the mighty-armed Rāghava shouldreach this terrible-looking and impregnable Lankā reared byRāvana, what could he do? Opportunity find I none either forconciliation with the Rākshasas, or for (winning them over) bygifts, or for sowing dissensions among them, or forconquering them in fight. Of all the monkeys, four only endowedwith (exceptional) celerity,—viz., Vāli's son, Nila, theintelligent king, and myself, have the power to come overhere. When I have ascertained whether Vaidehi is aliveor not, I shall, after interviewing Janaka's daughter, thinkabout this.\" Then that elephantine monkey, stationed onthe summit of that mountain, for a while bethought himselfas to the success of Rāma.232 \"I cannot in this form succeedin entering the city of the Rākshasas, guarded by wily andpowerful Rākshasas. I should, while engaged in searchingfor Jānaki, deceive all the strong and highly energeticRākshasas gifted with prowess. For attaining this mightyobject, it behoveth me to enter Lankā, at night in a shapeinvisible yet well suited to the end in view.\" And beholdingthe city in that state, difficult of being subdued by thecelestials and Asuras (combined), Hanumān, sighingmomentarily, thought within himself,—\"How can I, without beingdiscovered by the impious lord of Rākshasas, Rāvana,succeed in seeing Janaka's daughter, Maithili? How canthe work of Rāma cognizant of self (be so managedthat it) may not be brought to naught? How can I seeJanaka's daughter singly in secret? Actions on the veryeve of success, on being obstructed by adverse seasonand place, and through the agency of unreflecting envoys,come to nought, even as darkness is dispelled onsunrise. And in respect of what should be undertakenand what not, even the certain decision (of a master assistedby his counsellors), because of a heedless messenger,doth not appear in all its beauty: messengers (foolish) yetproud of their knowledge, bring every business to nought.How can I so manage that my business may not suffer?How can I avoid recklessness? How can my bounding overthe deep bear fruit? On my being seen by the Rākshasas,the work of Rāma cognizant of self, desirous of thedestruction of Rāvana, shall be marred. Even if I wear a Rākshasaform, I cannot anywhere remain undiscovered by theRākshasas. What shall I say of any other form? Even thewind, I conceive, doth not stray here, unperceived. Nothingwhatever is here that is unknown to the Rākshasas ofredoubtable deeds. Should I stay here embodied in mynative form, I shall come by destruction; and the interestalso of my master shall suffer. Therefore, diminishing myself,I shall at night, for compassing the welfare of Rāghava,enter Lankā in my own form. Entering at night Rāvana'scapital difficult of access, I shall, obtaining entry into everydwelling seek Janaka's daughter.\" Having made up hismind thus, the heroic Hanumān, extremely eager to seeVaidehi, wished for the setting of the sun. On the sunhaving set, at night the Wind-god's son, contractinghis person, reducing himself to the dimensions of a cat,became wonderful to behold. And at dusk, the powerfulHanumān, springing up, entered the charming city of Lankāwith its well divided highways; furnished with rows ofedifices having golden pillars, and net-works,—resemblingthe metropolis of the Gandharbas. And he saw that splendidcity containing seven-storied and eight*storied edifices,studded with crystal and adorned with gold. And thedwellings of the Rākshasas were embellished with these(ornaments). And graceful golden gateways belonging tothe Rākshasas everywhere lent splendour unto Lankāadorned all over. Beholding Lankā, wonderful and ofinconceivable loveliness, the mighty monkey, desirous ofbeholding Vaidehi, became depressed and delighted at thesame time. And he (entered Lankā) engarlanded with yellowedifices joined together, with the ornamented arches of hergateways furnished with nets of precious gold; famed (allover the world); ruled by the arm of Rāvana, and vigilantlyguarded by night-rangers of dreadful strength. And asif ministering unto him,233 the Moon furnished with manythousands of rays arose with the stars in the midst of the sky,spreading lunar light over all creatures. And that heroicmonkey beheld the Moon possessing the sheen of a conch,and hued like milk or the lotus-stalk, arisen and afloat (inthe welkin), like a swan swimming in a tank."

And suddenly comingto that (city) resembling Amarāvati, scattered with cloudscharged with lightning, having hosts of luminaries, andtumultuous with the roars of blustering blasts,—girt roundby a mighty golden wall,—ringing with the tinklings of tinybells; and embellished with pennons,—he growing exceedinglyexhilarated, made towards the wall. And beholding the cityall round, furnished with golden doors; having quadrangularcourts composed of lapises; ornamented with plasteredjeweled pavements studded with all gems, crystals, andpearls; with mad elephants of burnished gold and specklesswhite silver; with stairs of lapises,—(doors) devoid of dustwith their centres composed of crystal and with stately halls;elegant,—and adjoining mansions seeming as if reaching upto the heavens; resounding with Kraunchas and peacocks;frequented by swans; and everywhere resonant with the soundsof trumpets and ornaments. And then beholding the cityLankā, resembling Vaswokasāra,235 and appearing to mount tothe welkin, the monkey Hanumān was filled with rapture.And seeing the delightful, divine and prosperous city ofLankā belonging to the lord of Rākshasas, that one endowedwith prowess thought within himself,—\"This city protectedby the forces of Rāvana with their hands holding upraisedarms, is incapable of being forcibly subdued by any other.This place can be easily entered by Kumuda, and Angada, aswell as by that mighty monkey, Sushena; and also by Maindaand Dwivida. And there is way also for the offspring ofthe Sun, and that monkey, Kuçaparva, as well as of thatforemost of monkeys, Rikshya, and myself.\" And havingwitnessed the prowess of Rāghava, as well as the vigor ofLakshmana, the monkey was filled with joy. And thatredoubtable monkey beheld the metropolis of the monarch ofthe Rākshasas; having for her cloth the sea; for her pendants,cow-stalls and stables; for her breasts, turrets mounted onthe walls for discharging missils,—decked out like a damsel;with her darkness dispelled by bright lights and the mightyplanets. And as he was entering, that tiger-like mightymonkey son unto the Wind-god was met by the city in hernative shape. And seeing that best of monkeys, Lankā, ruledby Rāvana, arising of herself with her countenance rendereddeformed, stood before the heroic son of the Wind; and,emitting a tremendous roar, addressed the offspring of theWind god, saying,—\"O thou that hast the woods for thy home,who art thou? And on what errand hast thou come hither?Tell me while yet thou hast thy vital powers left in thee.O monkey, for certain thou art unable to obtain entry intothis Lankā, protected by the forces of Rāvana, and carefullyguarded on all sides.\" Thereat, the heroic Hanumān spokeunto her staying in front of him,—\"I shall tell thee all aboutthat anent which thou questionest me. Who art thou thathaving deformed eyes stayest at the gate of this city? Andwhat for, O frightful one, dost thou rail at me in wrath?\"Hearing Hanumān's speech, Lankā, capable of wearingforms at will, waxing wroth addressed the Wind-god'soffspring, saying,—\"I, who am incapable of being repressed,abiding by the mandate of the high-souled sovereign of theRākshasas, protect this city. Thou art unable to enter thiscity, passing me by. Thou shalt to-day, losing thy lifeand slain by me, sleep (the sleep of death). O monkey,I am the City of Lankā myself. I every way guard (allthat is here.\") Hearing Lankā's words, Hanumān, sonunto the Wind-god,—foremost of monkeys—exertinghimself (to secure victory), stood like another hill. And seeingher appear in the form of a deformed female, that foremostand best of monkeys endeued with intelligence, possessedof prowess, said,—\"I will behold the city of Lankā, crownedwith turrets, walls and ornamented arches, it is for thisthat I have come here. Great is my curiosity. I comeforsooth to see the woods and groves and gardens of Lankā here,—as well as her principal edifices.\" Hearing these words ofhis, Lankā capable of wearing forms at will, again addressedhim in a speech fraught with disonant letters: \"O thou ofperverse understanding, O worst of monkeys, without (in thefirst instance) vanquishing me, thou canst not to-day beholdthis city ruled by the monarch of the Rākshasas.\" Thereatthat tiger of a monkey said unto that female ranger of thenight,—\"After seeing this city, O gentle one, I shall go awayeven as I have come.\" Thereupon, setting up a mighty andterrible roar, Lankā filled with vehemence, struck at Hanumānwith her palm. And that tiger-like monkey, the energeticoffspring of the wind-god, on being lustily struck by Lankā,emitted a tremendous roar. And (Hanumān) fastened thefingers of his left hand into a box, and transported with rage,dealt it unto her. And considering that she was a female,he did not give way to excessive wrath. And struck at (byHanumān), that ranger of the night, of a deformed face, herbody overcome, suddenly dropped to the earth. And theenergetic and heroic Hanumān, seeing her measure herlength,—in consideration of her being a female, was filledwith compassion. Thereat, exceedingly agitated, Lankāaddressed the monkey, Hanumān, in humble words, withtheir letters faltering,—\"O mighty-armed one, be propitiousunto me! Do thou save me, O best of monkeys, O placid one.Those that are gifted with strength and are endeued withexceeding vigor, ever bear regard unto the dignity of thescriptures. By thy prowess, O monkey, hast thou, O hero,O thou gifted with wondrous strength, vanquished me myself,who am the City of Lankā. Listen to this narration, which I,O foremost of monkeys, deliver unto thee; as to bow theself-create Himself conferred a boon on me.' When a certainmonkey shall by his prowess, bring thee under his sway, thenshalt thou understand that a fear is come unto the Rākshahas'.And that time, O placid one, hath come unto me, inconsequence of my meeting with thee. The truth ordained by theself-create knoweth no turning. The destruction of theunrighteous king Rāvana together with all the Rākshasas,hath come about in consequence of Sitā (having been carriedaway). Therefore, O best of monkeys, do thou enter thecity ruled by Rāvana; and accomplish such tasks as thouwishest to. Entering this splendid city lying under animprecation, governed by the chief of the Rākshasas, do thouat thy will happily repairing everywhere, search for the chastedaughter of Janaka.\""

And enteringthe city of Lankā, that one (ever) compassing the welfareof the monkey-king, set his left foot on the heads of hisfoes.236 And entering in by night, the offspring of theWind-god furnished with strength, proceeded along thehigh-way strewn with blossoms. And the monkey held hissway in the charming city of Lankā, resounding with gratefulsounds mixed with laughter, and ringing with trumpetblasts. And with multitudes of mansions marked with thethunderbolt and the hook, and adorned with diamondwindows, the charming metropolis looked splendid, like thewelkin with clouds. And then Lankā, with handsome andvariegated mansions of Rākshasas, resembling white cloudsand arranged like lotus-leaves; and adorned on all sides withstructures superscribed 'Vardhamāna,' shone forth in all itsglory. And that graceful one serving in the interests of theking of monkeys, ranging for Rāma's behoof, beheld (Lankā)adorned with variegated wreaths; and was highly delighted.And moving from house to house, that foremost of monkeysobserved on all sides various dwellings of diverse forms andcolor, and heard charming songs chanted in the three octaves237by damsels maddened with amour, resembling celestialApsarās. And he also heard the jinglings of zones and theclash of bangles; and sounds of footsteps on stairs of edificesbelonging to high-souled ones; and sounds proceeding fromclapping hands; and the roaring of lions here and there. And(Hanumān) heard there in the mansions of the Rakshas,Mantras recited by persons engaged therein, and those occupied inVaidika studies. And (Hanumān) saw goblins and Rākshasasstorming and eulogizing Rāvana; and mighty swarms ofRakshas stationed, covering the highway. And in thecentral courtyard, he found innumerable spies of the Rākshasa(Rāvana), some initiated, some bearing matted locks, somewith their heads shaven, and some clad in cow-skins, somein cloths and some going stark naked; and (he found therepersons) carrying handfuls of darbha for their weapons, and(having) the sacrificial fire-place for their arms; and thosebearing in their hands clubs and concealed weapons,238 or holdingrods as their aims, or having a single eye or a singlecomplexion,239 or having a single breast dangling down; and thoselooking dreadful with uneven attire;240 and dwarfs frightful tobehold; and bowmen; and swordsmen; and (warriors)carrying sataghnis and clubs for their arms; those bearingexcellent parighas in their hands, or blazing in curiousmail; persons not exceedingly fat, or exceedingly lean;not unduly tall, or unduly short; not extremely fair, orextremely dark; not unduly crooked, or unduly dwarfish;and those deformed, or many-formed, or endowed withbeauty, or possessing splendour; standard bearers; andflag bearers. And (Hanumān) saw also various weapons;and those having for their arms darts and vrikshas, orbearing pattiças and asanis, or having Kshepanis241 andnooses in their hands, saw that mighty monkey, or wearingwreaths, or having their persons daubed with pastes, oradorned with noble ornaments, or clad in various kinds ofraiment; and many a one ranging wherever he listed;and those holding sharpened javelins; and mighty onesbearing Vajras; and hundreds and thousands of warriorsgarrisoned in the central courtyard and engaged in vigilantlyguarding the interior,—having been directed by the lordof the Rakshas,—saw the monkey. And having seen thatedifice situated in front of the inner appartment, thatmighty monkey saw the famous mansion of the Rākshasachief, pinnacled on the mountain-top, with huge goldenarches over the gateway; surrounded by a moat enrichedwith pale lotuses; and completely guarded by a wall;resembling heaven itself; magnificent; resonant withgrateful sounds; resounding with the neighing of horses andwondrous steeds; and adorned with cars and vehicles, chariotsand dainty horse: elephants242; and four-tusked elephantsresembling masses of white clouds;—and possessing gracefulgateways. And the monkey entered the palace protectedby the Rākshasa chief,—guarded by maddened beasts andbirds, and thousands of goblins endowed with exceedinggreat prowess. And he (Hanumān) entered Rāvana's innerapartment girt round with a wall consisting of blazing goldand Jāmvunada;243 having its top decorated with costly gemsand pearls; and worshipped with excellent black Aguruand sandal."

And that highlyheroic monkey beheld the Moon hued like the sheen of conch,or milk, or lotus-stalk, arisen and afloat (in the heavens),—like a swan swimming in a pool. And that intelligent onefrom the earth beheld the Moon arrive at the mid-heavens;momentarily beaming out in lunar light; appearing (splendid)as if in conjunction with the Sun himself,—and like a bullloitering in his stall. And he saw the mild-rayed (Moon),chasing away the remorse of all; swelling the sea; anddisplaying all creatures,—attain the middle of the sky. Andthat Lakshmi who on earth remains on Mandara, at eve inthe sea, and on the lotus on water, looked exceedingly lovely,stationed beside the charming Moon. Like a swan in a silvercage, like a lion in a cave in Mandara, like a hero on a haughtyelephant, appeared the Moon in the middle of the sky. Andwith (the mark of) the horn the Moon resembled asharp-horned bull, or a mighty white hued hill with toweringsummits, or an elephant with his horns plated with gold.And, with his dirt composed of particles of cool waterremoved; and the darkness dispelled in consequence of thevicinity of the mighty planet;244 and with his spots appearingclear because of his shining appearance, appeared thehare-marked245 worshipful Moon in full splendour. And like a lion oncoming out of his cavern, or a lordly elephant on entering intothe thick of a mighty encounter, or a monarch on obtaininga kingdom,—appeared the Moon in full splendour. And nowappeared the revered Mid-night, chasing away darkness withthe Moon displayed,—when flesh-eating (Rākshasas) lendfull liberty to their vicious appetite for flesh; and whendisputes between lovers cease,246—and which bringeth downheaven itself.247 The sounds of strings sweet unto the earspread around; females sleep beside their husbands; andnight-rangers, given to astounding and terrible acts, are, in thesame way, out, indulging in their sports. And the intelligentmonkey saw mansions crowded with (Rākshasas), someinebriate with wine and others with wealth; and abounding incars and horses and golden seats; and fraught with the gracegot of heroism. And (Rākshasas) were parleying,—movingabout their plump arms,—railing at each other; and throwingintemperate speeches at each other. And (Hanumān saw)Rākshasas striking at their chests (by way of challenge),sinking on the persons of their beloved, wearing diversehabiliments, or stretching their tough bows. And (he) sawdebonair damsels daubing their frames with pastes; andothers, again, sleeping,—and fair-faced wenches smiling,—andothers sighing hard under the influence of anger. And withgigantic elephants roaring, (the place), honored by piouspersons,—with its heroes heaving sighs248—lookedexceedingly beautiful like a lake in which serpents are sighing forth.And in that apartment (Hanumān) saw persons of commandingunderstandings,249 endowed with a soft tongue,—instinct withthe spirit of reverence—the foremost men of all this world,—and bearing euphonious appelations,and clad in diverse attires.And beholding those well-formed people, whose conduct wasof apiece with their many virtues, (Hanumān) rejoicedexceedingly. And he saw some having beautiful forms; and othersdeformed,—and both possessed of splendour. And (Hanumān)saw there their wives worthy of noble ornaments andendowed with eminent beauty; of spotless character; possessinggreat potency; like unto stars in point of excellency ofconduct,—displaying side-glances and other tokens of dalliance,—engaged in dear drinking. And at dead of night Hanumānsaw some females blazing in beauty, affected simultaneously withbashfulness and bliss, on being embraced by theirparamours, like birds embracing their mates. And the sensibleHanumān saw there other females seated in stately halls,—lying in happiness on the laps of their lovers,—beloved oftheir lords—intent on virtue,—married women,—under theinfluence of Madana. And Hanumān saw some withoutsheets, like unto golden streaks,—paragons among women—of the hue of molten gold,—and some of a moon-likecomplexion, endeued with loveliness,—bereft of their beloved.And that exceedingly heroic monkey saw females in theirhomes experiencing the height of joy in the company of theirbeloved dear unto their souls; charming with blossoms;filled with gladness; and enchaining the hearts of their lordswith their loveliness. And Hanumān saw crowds of faceslike unto the Moon displayed,—with elegant eyes furnishedwith lovely lashes, and side-long looks; and multitudes ofornaments resembling beautiful lines of lightning. ButHanumān saw not Sitā, of the highest lineage,—everabiding by the way of righteousness; born in a royalline,—like unto a delightful and well-begot plant,—of a slender frame,—sprung from the mind (of Brahmāhimself); established on the eternal road (of chastity); havingher gaze fixed on Rāma; always engrossed in thecontemplation of Rāma,—the mind itself of her lord,—who hadentered through and through into the heart of her gracefullord,—ever superior to all other women; oppressed withthe grief of separation; and having her throat afflicted withthe vapour of grief; who formerly had her throat gracedwith that best of ornaments—the nishka; of excellenteyelashes; having a mellifluous voice; like unto a peahen rangingin the woods; (now) like unto an indistinct lunar lining,or a streak of gold covered with dust, or the color of asore-scar, or a gold-leaf broken off by the wind. And notfinding, (after so long a search) the Sitā of the lord of men,—the spouse of Rāma; best of those skilled in speech themonkey, deeming himself as having suddenly lost his skill insearch, was overwhelmed with sadness."

And (at length)that auspicious one arrived at the mansion of the Rākshasachief, surrounded by a shining wall hued like the Sun;protected by terrible Rākshasas, like a mighty forest by lions.And as that foremost of monkeys saw the mansion, withfretted arches plated with silver and embellished with gold,—beautifully abounding in splendid courts and gateways;containing elephant-drivers, and heroes knowing no fatigue;ever coursed by irrisistible steeds drawing cars, and curiousvehicles, Covered over with skins of lions and tigers,resounding with bells hung thereon, and embosoming effigies ofivory, gold and silver,—the locality of mighty cars, and thehome of mighty car-warriors; filled all around with manythousands of divers beauteous and dainty birds and beasts; wellprotected by meek Rāksha warders at the outskirts;thronged about with magnificent dames of the first order;containing gems of joyous damsels—the abode of theforemost Rākshasas—sounding like the sea with the soundsof superb ornaments; affluent with regal insignia andexcellent sandals; crowded with mighty ones, like a vastforest with lions; reasonant with trumpets and drums; andringing with the blares of conchs; where the ever adoredoffspring of the Parvas was always worshipped by theRākshasas; solemn like the sea; and resounding like theocean itself,—the mighty mansion of the high-souled(Rāvana);clad in costly jewels; scattered with precious gems—as thatmighty monkey beheld (Rāvana's residence), he set aboutsearching for Sitā.250 And that mighty monkey concluded. \"Thisis the ornament of Lankā bodied forth beautifully to the view,covered with elephants, steeds and chariots.\" And therein the vicinity of Rāvana's mansion,251 Hanumān began torange the dwellings of the Rākshasas from one to another,as well as all the gardens (located there). And withoutexperiencing any agitation, he observing (everything), rangedthe palaces. Then that one endowed with wondrous motion,with a bound entered Prahasta's palace; and then withanother, that (monkey) possessed of energy entered the abodeof Mahāpārçwa. Then that mighty monkey entered intothe abode of Kumbhakarna, resembling a mass of clouds;and thereafter that of Vibhishana; and then that ofMahodara, and then that of Virupāksha; and then the abode ofVidyujjibha, and then that of Vidyunmālā;—and then thatmighty monkey with a bound entered into the abode ofVahudanshtra. And then that leader of monkey-bandsgifted with great speed leapt into the abode of Suka, andnext into that of the intelligent Sārana, and next into thatof Indrajit. And that foremost of monkeys went to themansion of Jambumāla, and of Sumāla,—and (then) tothe abode of Rashmiketu, and Suryyasachu. And (next)that powerful monkey leapt into the mansion of Vajrakāya;and (next) the Wind-god's offspring entered the houseof Dhumrāksha, and (next) that of Sampāti, and thegrim Vidyudrupa, and Phana, and Vighana, andSukanābha, and Chakra, and Satha, and Kapatha, andHraswakarna, and Danshtra, and the Rākshasa Lomasa, andYudhyonmatta, and Matta, and the horseman,Dhwajagriva, and of Vidyujjibha and Vijibha, and of Hastimukha,and of Karāla, and Viçāla, and of Sonitāksha. The illustriousoffspring of the Wind, Hanumān, one after another, leaptinto all these noble edifices. And that redoubtable monkeyobserved the affluence of all these (Rākshasas) possessedof prosperity. And having bounded over the mansions ofall situated around, that one blessed with auspiciousness,at length came to the very mansion of the monarch of theRākshasas. And that tiger-like monkey—the best of hisspecies—ranging around, saw Rākshasis of frightful eyes,alternately mounting sentry over the couch of Rāvana—bearing darts and maces in their hands, and equipped withjavelins and clubs. And (there) in the residence of thatlord of the Rākshasas, he beheld various bands of Rākshasis,as well as Rākshasas of gigantic frames, upraising variouskinds of weapons; and steeds of exceeding fleetness, red,and white, and black; and first-rate elephants, possessed ofeminent grace, capable of crushing hostile elephants, andwell trained in arts relative to their species—like Airavatahimself in conflict. And there in that mansion he saw (allthese elephants), destroyers of hostile hosts—like untopouring clouds, or hills, sending up fountains, rumbling likeunto clouds, and invincible in battle by foes. And thatmonkey, son unto the Wind-god, saw in the mansion of thelord of Rākshasas, Rāvana, hosts by thousands; and carsof various forms of glittering gold, furnished all over withgolden net-works, resembling the risen sun; and gracefulgrots; and picture galleries; and sporting saloons,mountains composed of wood,252 captivating structures dedicated todalliance, and dwellings for day-dalliance,253—saw he in themansion of the Rākshasa monarch. And he beheld thatcharming mansion resembling Mandara, filled with places forpeacocks254; thronged with pennons and flagstaffs,—a very mineof countless gems,—a field of treasures spread around,—wherepersons of intrepid calmness were engaged in acts tending tothe safety of the treasures,—resembling the mansion herselfof Kuvera. And on account of the lustre shed by thegems, as well as the energy of Rāvana himself, that mansionappeared splendid like the ray-furnished Sun in all his glory.And the chief of monkey-bands saw bed-steads and seatsof gold and white vessels. And Hanumān entered themighty mansion, containing clay formed by Madha255 andAsava;256 filled with gemmed cans; charming; free fromimpediments; resembling the mansion herself of Kāma,—likethe abode of Kuvera,—resonant with the sounds of bangles andthe tinklings of zones, as well as with the beat ofmridanga-hides and other eloquent musical instruments; with palacesclose on each other; thronged with hundreds of females (likeunto) jewels; and containing capacious enclosures."

And he saw various structures close to oneanother, to which excellent conchs, arms and bows lent lustre;as well as huge and splendid towers belonging to edificesresembling mountains. And the monkey beheld mansions,treasuring various kinds of wealth, which were held in regardby both gods and Asuras,—devoid of every defect; andwhich had been won (by Rāvana) through his own might.257And (Hanumān) saw the mansions of the lord of Lankā,located in strict conformity with aesthetic laws,—appearing asif they had been constructed by Maya himself,—which hadon the earth beneath every excellence. And then hesaw the mansion of the lord of Rakshas himself, surpassingthe best structures; like unto a mass of towering clouds;captivating; boasting of a beauteous golden appearance;worthy of his own power,—and of incomparableloveliness; appearing as if the celestial regions haddropped down on the earth; blazing in beauty; teeming withcountless gems; like unto the brow of a mountain strewnwith the blossoms and the dust thereof of various trees; andillumined by the foremost females,—appearing like a massof clouds containing lightning, or the witching welkinfurnished with grace, afloat with excellent swans. And(Hanumān) saw the car variegated with countless gems; likeunto the top of a mountain variegated with innumerablemetals; or like the firmament garnished with the moon and theplanets,—or like clouds of diverse hues fused into ahomogeneous whole. The place in the car designed as the seat ofthe many, was filled with rows of hills;258 its hills were filledwith trees; its trees were filled with flowers; and (finally) itsflowers were filled with leaves and filaments. And (in it),where white mansions were reared, there were tanks filledwith fair flowers; and lotuses furnished with filaments; andpicturesque woods; and liquid lapses. And the mightymonkey beheld there the great chariot going after the nameof Pushpa, appearing beautiful, wheeling round in thesplendour of the gems—which had surpassed even the carspertaining to the abodes of the celestials. And (in that car) werebirds made of lapis iazulis; and (other) birds composed ofsilver and coral; and variegated serpents made of variousprecious metals; and fair-bodied steeds resembling those ofsuperior breeds; and there were constructed birds havinggraceful mouths; and fair, tapering, playful and contractedplumage, bearing blossoms made of coral and gold,—like untothe very plumage of Kāma himself. And there were elephantspossessed of graceful trunks, bearing fillaments; and withtheir trunks bearing lotus leaves,—engaged (in showeringwater on Lakshmi); as well as the goddess, made with fairarms, seated on a pool with a lotus in her hand. Thusentering that graceful mansion, like unto a mountain containingcharming caverns, (Hanumān) was seized with wonderment.And once again (entering that charming mansion), like untoa taking and fragrant tree during spring furnished with holes,Hanumān was seized with wonderment. Then rangingby bounds that honored city ruled by the arms of theTen-faced one, he, not finding the highly regarded and extremelydistressed daughter of Janaka, who had won over her griefby contemplating the virtues of her lord,—(was affected witbsorrow). And, not seeing Janaka's daughter, then the heartof that high-souled one, honored for his character by theworld, of schooled self, ever ranging by the waychiming in with morality, and having the scriptures for hiseye-sight—as he ranged about,—was oppressed with grief."

And searching for Videha's daughter,the large eyed Sitā, that slayer of enemies, Hanumān, rangedall through (this edifice). And Hanumān beheld the goodlyedifice where the Rākshasas used to dwell in common.And (at length) that one came upon the mansion itself ofthe lord of Rākshasas, having three-tusked and four-tuskedelephants, and protected by persons with upraised arms,and covering a capacious area. And (Hānuman beheld) theresidence of Rāvana, thronged with his Rākshasi wives,as well as with princesses forcibly brought thither (by him),—like unto the sea teeming with alligators and makaras,abounding in timingilas and fishes and snakes, and agitated bythe force of the wind. The same enchanting splendour thatis in Vaiçravana or the ray-riding Moon, remained everconstant and abiding in Rāvana's abode. And theprosperity of king Kuvera, or Yama, or Varuna, was here presentin the house of the Raksha,—or even surpassed by theprosperity (of Rāvana). In the midst of that mansion theWind-god's offspring found another,261 excellently constructed,having innumerable mad elephants;—that noble carembellished with all gems, entitled Pushpaka, which had beenconstructed in heaven by Viçwakarmā for Brahmā himself,—which Kuvera obtained from the Great-father through highausterities,—and which, vanquishing Kuvera by his prowess,the Rākshasa chief got possession of. And the mighty monkeyascended the splendid car Pushpaka, containing figures ofwolves,—made of Kārttaswara and Hiranya; graced withranges of goodly pillars; as if blazing in splendour;throughout garnished with narrow secret rooms and saloons, piercingthe heavens, and resembling Meru or Mandara, and like untothe flaming Sun; skilfully reared by Viçwakarma; withgolden staircases and graceful and grand raised seats, rows ofgolden and crystal windows, and daises composed of sapphires,emeralds and other superb gems; embellished with noblevidrumas, costly stones, and round pearls, as also withplastered terraces; pasted with red sandal, like unto gold,and furnished with a sacred aroma; and resembling the sunnew risen. And stationed thereon,262 Hanumān smelt the richodour of viands and drinks that was spreading on all sides;—and like one dear friend smelling another, he also smeltthe mighty Air, impregnated with aroma, which seemed likeembodied Odour. And (the Air) said unto Hanumān,—\"Comehere, where that Rāvana is.\" Then (descending fromPushpaka and repairing to that sleeping apartment of Rāvana),Hanumān saw the same, grand and graceful; belonging toRāvana; of transcendent beauty; comely like unto a lovelylady; diversified with jewelled staircases; illumined with heapsof gems; with its terraces constructed of crystal; havingstatues of ivory, pearls, diamonds, coral, silver and gold;adorned with jewelled pillars; and embellished all round withpillasters; and upheld on all sides by straight, elevated andgorgeously ornamented pillars of equal dimensions,resembling prodigious wings,—(the mansion) appearing to towerto the sky; containing spacious and parti-colored woolencloths bearing the marks of the Earth;263 extensive as theEarth is, with kingdoms and dwellings; resounding with theroars of infuriated elephants; redolent of divine fragrance;furnished with gay canopies; inhabited by the sovereign ofthe Rakshas; cloudy with aguru and dhupa; spotless;of a swan-like whiteness; engarlanded with flowers andleaves like unto the dappled and brilliant cow (of Vasishtha);bringing delight unto the heart; and enhancing the grace(of all creatures); removing sorrow; noble; and the generatrixof Grace herself. And as soon as Hanumān entered themansion protected by Rāvana, it like a mother regaled hissenses with their proper objects. \"This must be swarga, orthe region of the immortals, or the city of Amarāvati, or thesupreme Siddhi—\"264 thought the Wind-god's offspring. Andhe saw the golden lamps (shorn of their brightness),265 likeunto gamblers worsted at dice by others exceedingly skilful,and, in consequence, plunged in thought. And (Hanumān)conceived that (Rāvana's sleeping apartment) was in aconflagration, on account of the display of the lamps,Rāvana' s energy, and the splendour of the ornaments. Andwhen the night had been half spent, (Hanumān) saw thousandsof superb dames, adorned in various attires, and bearingapparels of diverse hues, and wreaths,—who having givenup sport, and come under the influence of wine and sleep,—were fast asleep on woolen sheets. And in consequence ofthe silence that reigned (in that apartment) embellishedwith (ornaments), it resembled a large lotus-grove, wherethe swans and the black bees are silent. And the Wind-god'soffspring beheld the countenances of those beauteous women,with closed eyes,—having their lashes shut through languor;and odorous with lotus-perfume. And their faces appearedlike lotuses blowing on the expiry of night and closingtheir petals by night. \"These lotus-faces like unto very lotusesthemselves, ever the six-footed ones266 seek once and again.\"Thus thought with discrimination the graceful, mightymonkey; and on account of their perfections, he confessedthose countenances to be equal to water-sprung267 (lotuses).And that apartment, in consequence of being graced bythose women, appeared splendid, like the autumnal, complacentsky decorated with the stars. And surrounded by them,the Rākshasa chief resembled the fair Moon encircled bythe stars. \"Those stars that drop from the firmament ontheir virtue deteriorating, have assembled here in a body,\"thus thought the monkey at that time. And the shine, form,and splendour of those females resembled, forsooth thoseof magnificently displayed, noble and lustrous stars. Andon account of their having been bereft of consciousnessthrough sleep, induced by fatigue brought on by drink (anddance), their hair was dishevelled, and their full wreathsand goodly ornaments lay scattered about. And someof those paragons had got their beauty-spots, smudged; andsome, their bangles loosening off; some, their chains runningto one side. And others had their pearl necklaces burst,—and their cloths getting away (from their persons), and thechains of their zones straying irregularly;—resemblingway-worn mares. And others again were without their ear-rings,and had their garlands torn and crushed; and resembledblossoming creepers, trodden down in a vast forest by mightyelephants. And the pearl chains of some sinning femalesresembling moon beams, having got topsy-turvy, was lying likesleeping swans between the breasts of the damsels. And thelapis chains of some resembled water-crows;268 and the finegolden chains turned upside down of others appeared like ruddygeese. And those ladies resembled rivers having hipsfor banks; containing swans and Karandavas, and beautifiedwith ruddy geese. And those sleeping females appearedlike streams; having Kinkinis for their ripples; and largegold lotuses;269 marks270 of amorous encounter on their personsfor ferocious aquatic animals; and perfections,271 for theirbanks. And on the tender frames, as well as on the topsof the breasts, of some graceful scratches consequent onpressure, appeared like ornaments. And the scarf-ends ofsome stirred by the air that was blowing about their faces,flapped on them again and again. And at the nether partof the faces of Rāvana's wives, they (the scarf-ends)appearedbeauteous like uplifted streamers of exceeding elegance,composed of many-hued golden yarn. And the ear-ringsof some dames possessed of a pleasant sheen, stirred bythe air that was breathing about their faces, were undulatinggently. And the sweet breath of their faces, naturallyfragrant, and redolent of sugar and dsava, was then regalingRāvana. And out of fear sprung from sleep and intoxication,some of Rāvana's wives were again and again smelling thefaces of those, co-wives with them, taking the faces tobelong to Rāvana. And from their hearts being firmlyfixed on Rāvana, those excellent women, having their senseaf separateness removed, (albeit thus dealt with), did whatwas dear unto them.272 And other females, makingtheir gay scarf-ends (for their sheets), and making theirarms, their pillows, were lying down there. And some werelying on others' bosoms and others again, on the arms ofthe latter. And some lay on the laps of others; andothers, again, on the breasts of the latter. And they reposedon each other's thighs, flanks, waists, and backs; andcoming under the influence of wine and amour, they layon each other's persons. And those females having elegantwaists, receiving pleasure from the contact with others'persons, were sleeping there, with their hands fastened byeach other. And that garland of females strung by the threadsof their hands, appeared beauteous, like a real wreath strungon a thread, with maddened black bees (seated thereon).And that multitude of females in a medley appeared like anassemblage of blooming plants in the month of Chaitra,273 withits wreaths formed in consequence of their coming in contactwith one another, and of its clusters touching each other,on account of the breeze blowing;—with the plantsencircling the graceful (necks of the trees),—and rife withBhramaras chasing each other.—And although the ornamentsof those women wearing ornaments, attires and wreaths,were put on proper places; yet (on account of the profusionof the ornaments themselves, as well as because of thecircumstance of the dames' sleeping),274 it was difficult to ascertainwhich ornament belonged to one damsel and which to another.And it seemed as if, Rāvana having attained rest (throughsleep), the flaming golden lamps furnished with various rays,were gazing at the girls with winkless eyes. Daughters ofRājarshis, of Vipras, of Daityas, of Gandharbas. and ofRākshasas, having come under the influence of desire, hadbecome his wives. And all those women had been procuredby Rāvana because he sought fight (with their relations)and some haughty dames, rapt with desire, had of themselvescome to this place. And there was no woman there, whohad been won by force by (Rāvana), possessed as he was ofprowess; but they had all been subdued by his qualities.And save the surpassingly worthy daughter of Janaka, nofemale (had been brought), who had set her heart on another,or who had known any other before. And there was nonewho, being his wife, was not of high extraction; none whowas defective in grace; none who was not of sterling merit;none who was not decked out in ornaments and attire; andnone who was infirm; and none who was not an object ofdesire of her lover. And the lord of monkeys endowed withuprightness of sense, thought,—\"If the righteously weddedwife of Rāghava were as one of the wives of the king of theRākshasas, it would well for him.\" Again reflected he,—\"Sitā is crowned with chastity and other virtues; and thepowerful lord of Lankā, assuming an illusory form, hathwith much ado perpetrated this ignominious act.\""

And Hanumān saw a splendidsofa garnished with gold, bearing garlands of açokablossoms,—flaming like fire; around which persons kept wavingwith their hands chowris furnished with hair275; rife withperfumes of various kinds; odorous with rich dhupa, spreadwith excellent sheets; covered with the skins of rams;and decked on all sides with chaplets of gorgeous flowers.And that excellent and mighty monkey beheld therein theheroic sovereign of the Rākshasas, Rāvana, resembling amass of clouds; with flaming and brilliant ear-rings; havingreddened eyes; of gigantic arms; wearing a cloth composedof golden threads; his person daubed with fragrant redsandal; looking like a crimson cloud at eve fraught withlightning; covered with noble ornaments; endowed witheminent grace; capable of wearing forms at will; resemblingMandara affluent with trees and woods and shrubs;—sleeping,having given up sport at night; adorned with elegantornaments; dear unto the daughters of the Rākshasas,—thesource of happiness unto Rākshasas;—who had ceased fromdrinking,—asleep on a shining bedstead,—and respiring like a(kissing) serpent.276 And reaching there, Hanumān, waxingwondrous agitated, shrank back, as if in fear. And thenarriving at the staircase, the mighty monkey, stationing himself ona dais in the middle of the stairs, gazed at the inebriate,Rākshasa, resembling a tiger. And as the sovereign of theRākshasas was sleeping, his graceful bed resembled a grandcascade, beside which stands an elephant breathing odour.And Hanumān saw the arms of the huge-bodied lordof Rākshasas, fastened with bracelets,—stretched (there),—like unto the banners of Indra; which had been woundedby the tusk-ends of Airavata, whose plump parts bad beenriven by vajra; and which had been torn by the discus ofVishnu; well developed; having equal and elegant parts;with hard joints; fraught with strength; with thumbs havingnails bearing auspicious marks; having rings (on the fingers);covered; formed like bludgeons; round; resembling the trunksof elephants; cast on the white bed like unto five-hoodedserpents; smeared and adorned with cool, fragrant, andexcellent sandal resembling the blood of hares; pressedby paragons; odorous with incense; resisting (in battle)Yakshas, and Pannagas, Gandharbas, gods and Dānavas;and the monkey saw his arms resting on the bed, likeunto two beautiful and mighty serpents sleeping in theentrails of Mandara. And with both those well developedarms of his, the lord of Rākshasas resembling a hill, lookedhandsome like Mandara with its summits. And breathbearing the aroma of the mangoe, and the Pannāga, thesweet scent of the Vakula, the savour of viands fraughtwith the six kinds of tastes, and the perfume of wines, cameout of the mighty mouth of the sovereign of the Rākshasas,filling, as it were, that entire chamber. And (Hanumān)beheld (Rāvana), with his countenance, aglow with ear-ringsand decked with a golden diadem embellished with pearlsand jewels; daubed with red sandal; and adorned with;an elegant chain; having a large, broad, and full-developedbreast; with a white silken cloth on, falling off his person;furnished with blood-red eyes; covered with costly yellowsheets; appearing like a mass of unrighteousness; breathinglike a serpent, or an elephant asleep in the mighty Gangāduring the rains;—four lamps set on the golden pilarsillumining four sides; even as lightnings display the entiresurface of a mass of clouds. (And Hanumān) also saw inthe mansion of the Raksha chief, the wives of thathuge-bodied one dear unto his wives,—lying at his feet. Andthat protector of monkey-bands saw them, havingcountances resembling the Moon displayed; decked out withelegant ear-rings; bearing unfading garlands277 by way ofornamentation; lying on the arms and lap of the lord of theRakshas. And the monkey saw women bearing nobleornaments,—lying down. And he saw golden bracelets andear-rings at the nether ends of the women's ears,—set withdiamonds and lapises. And with their fair countenancesresembling the Moon, graced with comely ear-rings, thatterrace looked beautiful, like the welkin embellished withstars. The slender-waisted wives of the sovereign of theRākshasas, overcome with languor consequent on drink andamorous encounter, were fast asleep at the very places wherethey were seated. And another transcendentally beautifuldamsel possessed of lovely limbs, skilled in dance, was fastasleep, betraying comely movements (during sleep). Andanother was seen asleep, embracing a vinā,—like a lotus withspreading petals, resting by the side of a raft. And anotherdark-eyed wench was asleep with her mudduka278 on her lap,like a loving mother having a boy. Another damsel possessedof graceful limbs and a shapely bust, was lying down,hugging her kettle-drum,—like a woman embracing herlover, obtained after a long time. And one lotus-eyed femalewas asleep, embracing her vinā; like an amorous damselhugging her fair paramour. And another girl ofrestrained self, given to dancing, had come under the swayof sleep, embracing her vipanchi279 like a femalesleeping with her lover. And another having inebriate eyes,was fast asleep, embracing her mridanga with hercharming, plump, and tender limbs, resembling gold.Another female of faultless features, endeued with a slenderframe, having been overcome by lassitude consequent ondrink, was asleep.with her panava on the ends of her lowergarment, held fast with her hands. Another woman wassleeping soundly, embracing her dindima280 with anotherbound at her back; like a female taking both her loverand her child. Another damsel having eyes resemblinglotus-petals, having come under the influence of liquor, was asleep,firmly holding her aramvara281 with her hands. Anotherwoman, intoxicated by wine, was discovered asleep, with herwater-vessel upset; and, in consequence, appearing like awell-washed variegated wreath in spring. Another, coming underthe masterdom of slumber, was sleeping, holding with herhands her twin breasts resembling golden jars. And anotherlotus-eyed and moon-faced fair one, coming under thegovernance of slumber, (was asleep), embracing another furnishedwith shapely hips. And eminently beautiful dames wereasleep, embracing musical instruments; like wenchespressing lustful (lovers), with their breasts. And that monkey sawthat lady, endeued with beauty, lying down apart in anexcellent bed; adorned with ornaments containing pearls andjewels; and as if decorating that charming mansion withher grace. And the monkey saw there the yellow-huedMandodari, having the splendour of gold; the object of(Rāvana's) desire; beautiful exceedingly,—the mistress of theinner apartment,—lying down. And seeing (Mandodari)adorned with ornaments, the offspring of the Wind-godguessed,—\"This one endowed with the wealth of youth andbeauty might be Sitā.\" And demonstrating great joy, thatleader of monkey-bands rejoiced exceedingly. And thereat,(Hanumān) struck at his arms with his hands, kissed his tail,exhibited signs of glee, frolicked, sang, darted towards thepillars, shot up to the top thereof, and jumped down to theearth,—manifesting his monkey-nature."

  "Āranya, Kishkindhā, and Sundara Kāndam": "Then resigning that line of thought,282 that mightymonkey, regaining his equanimity, set out in anotherdirection of thought touching Sitā. \"Separated from Rāma, thatlady is incapable283 of of sleeping, or eating, or decorating(her person), or drinking. And she is incapable ofassociating with any other person, although he were thesovereign of the celestials himself. And even in all heaventhere is none who is equal to Rāma. She is some other.\"Assuring himself of this, that foremost of monkeys, eager tobehold Sitā, again began to range in that place set apartfor drinking. Some were tired out with sporting; some withsinging; some with dancing; and some were fast asleepthrough intoxication. And some supported themselves onmurajas, mridangas, or chelikas; and some women weresleeping on excellent sheets. And that leader ofmonkey-bands saw (that place of drinking) filled with thousands ofwomen, adorned with ornaments engaged (in their sleep)in depicting each other's loveliness; and explaining the senseof songs; conversant with season and place;understanding the meanings of words chiming in with season andplace284; and skilful at play. And at other places also hesaw thousands of superb and youthful dames fast asleep,—employed in talking of each others beauty. And that leaderof monkey bands saw (women) versed in season and place,and understanding the meanings of words consonant withseason and place. And in the midst of them all, the lord ofthe Rākshasas looked splendid like an ox in a spacious stallin the midst of stately kine. And surrounded by them, theRākshasa chief appeared beautiful like a gigantic elephant ina forest, surrounded by female elephants. And in the abodeof the huge-bodied Rākshasa chief, this tiger-like monkeysaw that place of drinking, furnished with every object ofdesire. And in that place set apart for drinking, he saw heapsof the flesh of buffaloes, deer, and boars, arranged separately.And that tiger-like monkey saw in capacious golden vesselsflesh of fowls and peacocks, which remained (after the repast).And Hanumān saw the flesh of boars, and Vādhrinasas285Sulyas, deer, and peacocks, seasoned with curds andSauvarchala;286 and Krikalas,287 and goats of various kinds.-flesh of harehalf-fed,—Ekaçalyas,288 and buffaloes,—all chopped and dressed;and lickable and drinkable viands sharp and mild; and ediblessharp and mild; and Rāgakhāndavas289 containing sugar andacid, capable of improving a vicious palate. And with largeand costly stray bangles and bracelets; and scattered cans,—and diverse kinds of fruit; and wreaths of flowers, thepavement attained exceeding beauty. And with elegantly jointedbedsteads, arranged (around), the scene of wassail appearedaflame without fire. And with meat consisting of manyingredients, fraught with diverse tastes, seasoned with manysubstances, and dressed by skilful cooks,—arrangedseparately in the scene of revel; and with noble and pleasant wines,natural290 and artificial,—āsavas from sugar; and Mādhvika291 andāsavas from flowers and fruits; and impregnated separatelywith different kinds of fragrant dust,—the pavement,furnished with inuumerable garlands, surrounded with goldenwater-vessels and crystal bowls, and golden water-pots, lookedexceedingly beautiful. And the monkey saw that foremost ofall places set apart for drinking, containing silvern and goldenjars. And that mighty monkey saw golden wine-vesselsstudded with gems, all filled with wine; and some withhalf full of liquor, some with their wine entirely exhausted, andsome full of liquor. And (at some spots) he saw variouskinds of viands, and at others wines ranged in rows,and at others the wine-vessels remaining half full. Andthere were many bedsteads belonging to fair ones, remainingvacant; and at some places excellent women were sleepingtouching each other. And at one place, a female, bornedown by the force of sleep, forcibly possessing herself ofanother's cloth, and wrapping herself therewith,—went to thebed of that one, and was indulging in sleep.—And with theirbreath, their variegated wreaths and the cloth on their personswere stirring gently, as if with a mild-blowing breeze.And laden with the odours of cool sandal and of sweet-tastingSidhu;292 and of diverse wreaths and flowers, and withperfumes of various kinds,—and entranced293 with (the aroma of sandalssuitable for use after ablution, and of dhupas, the air,impregnated with excellent scent, was there breathing around thecar Pushpaka. And in the residence of the Raksha, therewere some wenches sable, yet exceedingly witching; andsome were dark-hued; and the frames of some were of agolden brilliance. And their beauty, in consequence of theircoming under the governance of sleep, and their being bereftof their senses by Madana, resembled that of lotuses in asleep. Thus that highly energetic monkey saw everythingthoroughly in the inner apartment of Rāvana,—but he sawnot Janaka's daughter. And seeing those females, thatmighty monkey, apprehending loss of righteousness, wasseized with an exceeding great fear294. \"Beholding a female,who is the religiously wedded wife of another, while she isasleep295, verily causeth loss of righteousness. My sightsurely never seeketh others' wives; but I have beheld thisone that hath ravished another's spouse.\" And thatintelligent one, intent on attaining a knowledge of thingscapable of being arrived at on grounds of judgment, againreflected effectively as to his course of action: \"All theseunsuspecting wives of Rāvana have been beheld by me; yetthere are no signs that my mind hath undergone anyalteration. In respect of the enlistment of the senses on behalfof any course of action good or evil, it is verily mind whichis the cause; and herein my mind is righteously disposed.And I could not search for Vaidehi elsewhere; for in thematter of search, people always search for women even amongwomen. And people search for creatures among the speciesto which they happen to belong: none searcheth for a lostlady among female deer. Therefore have I with a pureheart explored the entire inner apartment of Rāvana; butJanaka's daughter I see not.\" And Hanumān endowed withprowess saw the daughters of gods, and Gandharbas, andNāgas; hut he saw not Jānaki. And not seeing her, thathero, having beheld other magnificent dames, coming out ofthat place, set about searching for Sitā (afresh). And leavingthe place of wassail, the graceful offspring of the Wind-god,taking extreme care, again began to search for Sitā all about(another quarter)."

  "Āranya, Kishkindhā, and Sundara Kāndam": "And remaining in that mansion, (Hanumān) desirous ofgetting a sight of Sitā graced with a fair presence, wentinto bowers, and picture galleries, and night-houses;296 buther he did not find. And not finding the beloved (spouse)of Raghu's son, that mighty monkey reflected,—\"Surely Sitāis not alive,—for although I have searched (through andthrough), yet Mithilā's daughter I have failed to find. Andthat girl solicitous for the preservation of her chastity, andstaying in the prime path of virtuous woman,—that chasteone—hath, for certain, been slain by this chief of theRākshasas, (ever) finding delight in iniquity. And seeingthe wives of the Rākshasa monarch,—of frightful forms,—monstrous; of lurid hue; having huge faces; with large horrideyes,—the daughter of Janaka hath given up the ghostfrom fright. Failing to see Sitā, and (thereby) annulingmy prowess, and having long spent the appointed spacein company with the monkeys, way have I none to presentmyself before Sugriva, that monkey being puissant andgiven to meting out sharp chastisement. Having searchedthe inner apartment through, and seen the wives of theRākshasa, I do not see the chaste Sitā. Therefore vain isthe trouble that I take. What, alas! shall the monkeysassembled tell me when I shall go (to them)? 'O hero, tellus what thou hast done, repairing there.' And not havingseen Janaka's daughter, what shall I answer? The termfixed (by Sugriva) having been past, certainly meet it is thatI should fast to death. And what shall the aged Jambhavān,and what shall Angada, say? And what, again, shall theassembled monkeys say to me when I shall have crossed overthe main? But perseverence is the source of good fortune;and perseverence bringeth about supreme happiness. Searchagain I will, where I have not yet searched. Perseverence,for certain, ever bringeth people to all profitable objects.Whatever one doeth with vigor, beareth fruit. Therefore willI put forth fresh dear efforts vigorously. I will search suchplaces held by Rāvana as I have not yet seen. I haveagain searched the picture-galleries and thesporting-structures, and edifices, and roads passing through gardens, aswell as the cars.\" Having thought thus, Hanumān again setabout searching the subterranean abodes, religious buildings,and many-storied mansions. And flying up, and comingdown, and staying, and going at places, and opening doors,and shutting others, and entering and issuing out, andfalling down as if darting up, that mighty monkey began torange on all sides. There was not even space measuringfour fingers in that inner apartment of Rāvana, to which themonkey did not repair. And he saw the abodes of thenobility, the daises, the trees by the crossings the holes, andthe tanks. And Hanumān saw there Rākshasas of variousforms, frightful and deformed; but he saw not Janaka'sdaughter. And Hanumān saw there the wives ofVidyādharas; but he saw not Rāghava's beloved. And Hanumānsaw there transcendentally beautiful women—daughters ofNāgas—having countenances resembling the moon; but hesaw not Janaka's daughter. And Hanumān saw theredaughters of Nāgas forcibly brought by the lord of theRākshasas; but he saw not Janaka's daughter. Having seenother beauteous females, and not seeing her, themighty-armed son of the Wind-god was oppressed with sadness.Seeing that the endeavours of the monarch of monkeys, aswell as the bounding over the main, had come to nought, theoffspring of the Wind-god was plunged in thought.Descending from the aerial car, Hanumān, son unto the Wind-god, hissenses deprived by sorrow, was again wrought up withanxiety."

  "Āranya, Kishkindhā, and Sundara Kāndam": "Allighting from the car, Hanumān possessed of vigorousactivity,—leader of monkey-bands—nearing the wall, lookedlike lightning within a mass of clouds.297 And having goneround the mansions of Rāvana, and not seeing Jānaki, themonkey Hanumān said,—\"Striving after Rāma's welfare,I have again searched through Lankā; but I do not seeVideha's daughter, Jānaki, having all her limbs endeued withloveliness. And I have explored pools, and watery expanses,and tanks, and rivers, and streams, and marshes, and woods,and citadels, and mountains, yea,—all this earth; but JānakiI do not find. The vulture-king Sampati had told that Sitāwas in the mansion of Rāvana. But why do I not see her(here)? Or doth Maithili Sitā, daughter unto Janaka,298 sprungin the Videha line, forcibly carried off (by Rāvana) andcompletely in his power, abide by the mandate (of thatmonarch)? I conceive that while taking Sitā, the Rakshadarted upward, he being influenced by fear of Rāma's shafts;(and accordingly losing control over his movements), she felloff by the way. Or I fancy that while that noble lady wasbeing carried away along the way ranged by Siddhas, shelost her life on beholding the ocean. Or I think that onaccount of the vehement speed assumed by Rāvana, and alsooppressed with his arms, that large-eyed noble lady hath beenbereft of her life. For certain, while (Rāvana) was soaringhigher and higher, Janaka's daughter, rolling (on the car),dropped down into the sea. Alas! trying to preserve herchastity. the forlorn Sitā, practising self-mortification, hathbeen devoured by this abject-minded Rāvana. Or thatdark-eyed innocent one, hath been eaten up by tbe wives of theRākshasa chief, actuated by wicked motives.299 (Ever)contemplating Rāma's countenance, resembling the full Moon, witheyes like lotus-leaves, she, exercised with sorrow, hathbreathed her last. Bewailing much with exclamations of'Oh Rāma and Lakshmana!' 'Ah Ayodhyā!' that ladyVaidehi hath renounced her body. Or secretly kept inRāvana's mansion, that girl, like a female parrot in a cage,is weeping bitterly. How can the slender-waisted wife ofRāma, born in the race of Janaka, furnished with eyesresembling lotus petals, come under the sway of Rāvana? I shallnot be able to say of Rāma's beloved wife that she hath beensullied,300 or that I have seen her, or yet that she is dead.To say this is censurable; not to say it is also such.What is my course? I find myself in a false position. Thingshaving drifted to this pass, what should I say, now that thetime hath come?' Thus thinking, Hanumān againreflected,—\"If without seeing Sitā, I repair to the abode of thelord of monkeys, what then shall I gain as the object of myexertions? This my bounding over the main comes tonought; as also my entry into Lankā and the sight of theRākshasas. And what shall Sugriva say? Or the assembledmonkeys; or those twin sons of Daçaratha; to me whenI shall have come to Kishkindhā? And if going there, Ishould say a harsh speech unto Kākutstha—'I have not seenSitā'—he shall renounce his life. Hearing harsh, terrible,unsufferable, fierce and foul words concerning Sitā, calculatedto set the senses on fire, he shall not exist. And seeing himcome under misery, with his mind expiring, the intelligentLakshmana, firmly attached (unto Rāma), shall also cease toexist. And hearing that his two brothers are dead, Bharataalso shall give up existence. And seeing Bharata dead,Satrughna shall also renounce his life. And beholding theirsons dead, their mothers, Kauçalyā, Sumitrā and Kaikayi,shall, certainly, resign their lives. And seeing Rāma in thatplight, the lord of the monkeys, Sugriva, grateful and havinghis heart fast fixed in truth, shall give up his life. And Umā,aggrieved, heart-wrung, distressed and bereft of happiness,and assuming the garb of a female ascetic, because of grieffor her husband, shall resign her existence. And oppressedwith grief arising from Vāli, and weighed down by sorrow,the queen Tārā, also, resolving on death shall cease to exist.And in consequence of the death of his father and motherand the calamity befalling Sugriva, the prince Angada alsoshall next forego his existence. And the dwellers of thewoods overwhelmed with grief got of (the decease of) theirmaster, shall strike at their heads with their clenched fistsand hands. And the monkeys affectionately cherished bythe famous lord of the monkeys with soothing words giftsand regard, shall resign there lives. And no more in woods,and rocks, or secret spots, shall the foremost monkeys,assembled together, indulge in sports. And they, along withtheir sons and wives, and counsellors, distressed on accountthe disaster that hath overtaken their master,—shall fallfrom the tops of mountains down to places even or uneven.And the monkeys shall take poison, or hang themselves, orenter into flaming fire, or fast, or fall on their own weapons.I fancy that a loud wailing shall arise on my return (to thatplace); and the race of Ikshwāku as well as the rangers ofthe woods shall meet with destruction. Therefore I will notrepair hence to the city of Kishkindhā; nor can I see Sugrivawithout Mithilā's daughter. On my not going there andstaying here, those righteous-souled Mahārathas as well as thefast-fleeting monkeys, shall preserve their lives through hope(of hearing tidings concerning Sitā.) And not having seenJanaka's daughter, I will lead the Vānaprastha mode of life,partaking (of fruits) falling into my hands or mouth,restraining my senses, and staying at the foot of trees. Preparinga funereal pile on a tract bordering on the sea, aboundingin fruits, and flowers, and water, I will enter into flamingfire. And as I sit to fast, and for effecting the separation ofself from my body and centering my identity in the spiritcrows and beasts of prey shall feed on my body. AndI think the sages have enjoyed another way of exit. Ishall, failing to see Janaki, enter into water. My illustriousand exalted garland of fame, begot of excellent acts, hathperished for good in consequence of my not seeing Sitā.301Or restraining myself, I shall become an ascetic livingunderneath trees; but return I will not, without obtaining a sightof that dark-eyed damsel. If I return without seeing Sitā, allthe monkeys with Angada shall cease to exist. Incalculableare the ills of my putting a period to my existence; (on theother hand) if I live, I may come by good. Therefore mylife I will maintain. If I live, it may conduce to happiness.\"Having thus indulged in a variety of harassing thoughts inhis mind, that foremost of monkeys could not cross over to theother shore (of the sea of distress). Then summoning energy,that elephantine monkey endeued with fortitude reflected,—\"Or I shall slay the Ten-necked Rāvana possessed of greatstrength. Sitā hath been carried off; but by this I shall avengemyself. Or throwing him repeatedly into the sea, I (shall takehim) and present him to Rāma, even as one presents a beastunto Paçupat.\"302 Reflecting thus, the monkey, not finding Sitā,—agitated with sorrow and anxiety, thought,—\"So long as Ido not find the illustrious spouse of Rāma, Sitā, I will explorethe city of Lankā again and again. If in consonance withSimpāt's speech, I bring Rāma hither, Rāghava, not seeinghis wife, shall burn all the monkeys. (Therefore) even hereI shall stay, restraining my fare and mortifying my senses.All those principal monkeys ought not to lose their livesbecause of any act to which I may commit myself. This isthe asoka wood, extensive and containing mighty trees.This I shall explore, as it hath not yet been searched byme. And saluting the Vasus, the Rudras, the Adityas, thetwin Açwins, (and Rāma and Lakshmana), I enhancingthe sorrow of the Rākhas, shall go into it. Having vanquishedthe Rākshas, I will bestow on Rāma the lady of the Ikshwākurace like the fruit of asceticism conferred on an ascetic.\"Having thus reflected for a space, the mighty-armedoffspring of the Wind-god, his senses agitated with anxiety,arose. \"I bow unto Rāma with Lakshmana, and unto therevered daughter of Janaka, I bow unto Rudra, and Indra,and Yama, and Wind-god, and I bow unto the Moon, untoFire and unto the Maruts.\" Having bowed unto them all,as also unto Sugriva, the offspring of the Wind-god,surveying all the cardinal points, mentally entered the Asoka wood.Having mentally entered the Asoka wood, that monkey, sonunto the Wind-god, reflected as to what he should do next.The sacred Asoka wood, sanctified with every purifying riteand abounding in woods, needs must be full of Rākshas.And warders, directed there to, forsooth, protect the trees;and that worshipful Soul of the universe303 does not breathehere vigorously. I contract my person in the interests ofRāma, and in order that Rāvana may not see me. Mayall the deities along with the saints confer success on me.And may the revered self-create Brahmā, and the deities,and the ascetics, and Fire, and wind, and the much invokedbearer of the Vajra,304 and the noose-handed Varuna, andthe Moon and the Sun, the high-souled Açwinis, and all theMaruts—(confer) success (on me)! And all beings, and thelord of them all,305 and others that, albeit not specified in thescriptures, are yet visible in the way,—will confer successon me. When shall I behold the blameless face of that noblelady,—with its protruding nose; having luminous smiles,having eyes resembling lotus-petals; and bright as thecomplacent lord of stars? Ah! to-day how shall feeble forlornone that hath been borne down by the force of the mean,abject and grim-visaged (Rāvana) fierce yet wearing (at thetime of the rape), a dress tending to inspire confidence,—come in my sight?\""

  "Āranya, Kishkindhā, and Sundara Kāndam": "Having reflected for a while, and mentally met withher, that highly energetic one leapt from the wall ofRāvana's mansion on to that (of the Asoka wood). Andall his frame filled with delight, that mighty monkey,stationed on the wall, saw various trees having their tops furnishedwith flowers through spring and the other seasons,—salasand asokas, bhavyas, champakas, udalakas, and nāgas, andthose bearing fruits resembling the mouths of monkeys;and those relative to mango woods.—with hundreds of plants.And (Hanumān) leapt into the garden like an arrow let gofrom the bow string. Entering into the grove, variegatedall over; resonant with the notes of birds; filled on all sideswith golden and silvern trees; many-hued with birds andbeasts; containing dainty tracts of trees like unto the risenSun,—the powerful Hanumān saw the place surrounded withvarious kinds of trees, having fruits and flowers; frequentedby maddened coels and bhramaras, with creatures expressinghappiness by their movements, birds and beasts overflowingwith spirits; echoing with the cries of peacocks; furnishedwith various species of fowls. And as he was searching forthat surpassingly beautiful and blameless daughter of the king,that monkey awakened the monkeys that were sleepingsweetly. And blown against by the wind caused by the wingsof the birds as they flew upwards, various and variegatedtrees showered down blossoms. And in the midst of theAsoka wood, Hanumln, son unto the Wind-god, covered overwith flowers, looked lovely like a hill strewn with blossoms.And all creatures, beholding that monkey embosomed amongtrees and darting on all sides, took him for spring. Andstrewn with several masses of blossoms loosened from thetrees, the Earth appeared beauteous like a damsel dight withornaments. And shaken in diverse ways by the motion ofthe light fleeting monkey, the trees showered many-huedflowers. And with their leaves and tops torn, and their flowersand fruits shrivelled up, the trees looked like worstedgamblers bereft of their clothes. And shaken by Hanumānvehemently moving about, those excellent trees crowned withfruits, speedily cast off fruits, flowers and foliage. Andmoved by the Wind god's offspring, the trees with their trunksleft, and forsaken by the fowls were incapable of harbouringany creatures. And like youthful fair ones with hairdishevelled, their paste worn off, their upper lips with fair teethsucked of their moisture; and having their persons torn withnails and teeth; appeared the Asoka wood with its treesshattered; and itself ground with the tail, hands and legs (ofHanumān). And that monkey with his vehemence scatteredthe clusters of shrubs, like the wind violently scatteringclouds in the rainy season. And ranging there, the monkeysaw beautiful pavements, jewelled, silvern aud golden. Andhe saw there various pools filled with excellent water andhaving steps crusted with jewels. Their sandy soil wasfilled with pearls and corals, and the ground inside was madeof crystal. And their banks were decked with diverse goldentrees. They were beautified with full blown lotuses,water-lilies, Chakravakas and Natyuhas306 and filled with the notesof swans and Sārasas. They were encircled on all sideswith big tanks having trees on their banks and water, clearand sweet like unto nectar. They were entwined withhundreds of creepers, covered with Santāna307 flowers and filledwith diverse groves and Karaviras serving the purpose ofwindows.308 And thereupon that foremost of monkeys beheldthere a mountain—the most picturesque in the world,resembling clouds, having high summits, covered on all sides withpeaks and filled with hilly abodes and various trees. And thatmonkey beheld there a river falling down from the mountainlike unto a damsel falling down from the lap of her beloved.And the branches of the trees touching the water (of thestream) resembled a fair damsel prevented by her dearcompanions from forsaking the company of her beloved). Andthat great monkey beheld further down the stream turningback like unto the damsel, pleased, going back to her dearone. And that foremost of monkeys, Hanumān, the son ofMaruti, beheld, at some distance, ponds filled with lotusesand various birds. And he saw a big artificial pond full ofcool water having stairs crusted with excellent jewels and itssandy banks filled with pearls. It was embellished (on allsides) with various animals, diverse trees and big mansionsmade by Viswakarma309 himself. It was adorned all aroundwith artificial fqrests and all the trees there bore flowers andfruits, spreading their branches like unto umbrellas andhaving golden and silvern pavements under them. And thatgreat monkey beheld there one golden Singsapa310 treesurrounded on all sides with golden pavements. And hesaw the glebe, the hill streams and many a golden treeresembling fire. By the lustre of all those trees that heroicmonkey appeared as if made of gold like unto the Sunby the touch of the mount Sumeru. And having seen thosebeautiful golden trees, shaken by the wind and making asound like that of a Kinkini;311 having flowery tops and newleaves he was greatly amazed. And climbing that Singsapatree enveloped with leaves that monkey, gifted with velocity,reflected—\"Perchance I may see Vaidehi, exercised withgrief, anxious to behold Rāma and wandering hither andthither at her pleasure. Certainly this is the picturesqueAsoka forest of that vicious-souled one, embellished withsandal, Champakas and Vakulas. Here is a beautiful pondabounding in lotuses, thronged with birds and forsooth shallthat royal spouse Jānaki repair hither. She is the belovedqueen of Rāghava and expert in walking in the garden. Andseparated from Rāma, certainly shall Jānaki repair hither.Or she having the eyes of a young antelope and adept inroaming in the forest, exercised with thought touching Rāma,shall come here. Or she having beautiful eyes and fond ofranging in the forest, racked with sorrow in consequence ofRāma's separation, doth always frequent this forest.312 Erethis, the chaste and worshipful spouse of Rāma—Janaka'sdaughter, used to love always the birds and animals of theforest. (The morning hath set in) and surely the beautifuland graceful daughter of Janaka fond of performing morning313ablutions, shall come to this river of pure water to performthem. Truly is this beautiful forest of Asoka the worthyabode of the beloved and chaste spouse of Rāma, the lordof men. If that one of moon-like countenance breathes,forsooth shall she come to this river of cool water.\" Havingarrived there and anxiously expecting the appearance of thespouse of that lord of men, the high-souled Hanumān hidinghimself (on the Singsapa tree) enveloped with flowers andleaves, beheld all."

  "Āranya, Kishkindhā, and Sundara Kāndam": "Having stationed himself on the tree, casting hislooks all around in quest of Sitā and looking down on theearth he surveyed the entire forest of (Asoka). It wasbeautified with Santānaka creepers and various trees, fragrantwith celestial odours and was embellished on all sides. Itresembled Nandana or the celestial garden, and was filledwith various animals and birds, palaces and mansions;resounded with the notes of Kokilas; adorned with the pondsabounding in silvern water-lillies and lotuses; filled withmany seats and coverlets and various houses having spaciouscourtyards; adorned with beautiful flowers of all seasons andtrees bearing fruits. And the beauty of the blossomingAsokas resembled the effulgence of the Sun. And stationedthere Māruti beheld trees as if devoid of leaves on accountof the hundreds of birds, adorned with various flowers,resorting there. And he saw there the earth touched byAsoka trees, the removers of grief, having flowers growingfrom the roots and lowered down with their weight. Andthe entire quarter was as if ablaze with the beauty of theflowery Karnikaras and Kingsukas. And there appeared inbeauty many flowery Punnagas, Saptaparnas, Champakas,and Udalakas having deeply expanded roots. And therewas a thousand of Asoka trees, some of whom were 1ikegold, some were like the flame of fire and some were likedark-blue collyrium. It was like the garden of Nandana orlike that of Kuvera or perhaps it surpassed the both inexcellence. And enveloped in charming, celestial grace beyondconception and having flowers for stars that forest appearedlike a second sky. Aud covered with hundreds of pearl-likeflowers the forest looked like the fifth ocean. And thatgarden was embellished with flowers of all seasons andhoney-smelling trees, and filled with diverse notes and variousanimals and birds. And that fragrant garden was renderedmore charming with various other fragrances. And thatforemost of monkeys beheld in that garden of Asoka, a roundpalace, situated at a distance, fragrant as the Gandhamādanamountain and high as the lord of mountains. (Thepalace) was white as the Kailaça hill and built on athousand pillars. All its stairs were made of coraland its pavements made of burning gold. Its beautywas as if burning all along and stealing the vision of thelookers-on. It was spotless and on account of its heighttouched the welkin. And thereupon he beheld there (Sitā)wearing a soiled cloth, poorly, greatly reduced by fast,sighing again and again and encircled by a band of Rākshasees.She was (however) spotless like unto the rays of the moonon the first lunar day. And her graceful beauty could withgreat difficulty be perceived like unto the flame of fireenveloped with smoke. And wearing a shattered and soiledyellow cloth and divested of all ornaments she appeared likea lotus stalk without lotuses.314 Oppressed, racked with grief,weakened and chaste as she was, she appeared like Rohinipossessed by Ketu. She was greatly reduced by fast,stricken with grief and anxious thoughts, disturbed withsorrow and was poorly and her eyes were always full of tears.Separated from her kith and kin and not beholding Rāma andLakshmana315 but the Rākshasees, she appeared like a hindsurrounded by dogs. Her braid of long hair resembling ablack serpent falling on her back it appeared as if the Earthwas filled with dark-blue forests on the disappearance of therains. Sitā was worthy of happiness only and never knewof misery and therefore she was (now) greatly oppressed withsorrow. And beholding that one of expansive eyes renderedpale and feeble, Hanumān, by various conclusive argumentsreflected within himself \"She must be Sitā, for this damsellooks just like her, whom I saw, when she was ravished byRāvana, assuming shapes at will. Having the countenanceof the full-moon, beautiful eye brows, round breast, she is asif dispelling the darkness from all quarters by virtue ofher grace. Her throat was yellow, and her lips were likeBimbas.316 She was of middle stature and her limbs were allwell built. She had eyes resembling lotus petals and waslike the beloved wife of Manmatha—Rati and was adorableunto the whole creation like the rays of the full-moon. Thatone having a graceful person was seated on the earth like afemale ascetic having her senses restrained. And she wassighing again and again like the timid daughter-in-law ofthe lord of serpents.317 Entangled by a mighty web of griefher grace was greatly lessened and she appeared like theflame of fire enveloped in smoke. She was like unto Smritiof doubtful meanings, fallen wealth, lost respect, hopewithout any desire for gain, Sidhi318 of many troubles, sulliedunderstanding and fame soiled with false rumours. Thatinnocent one was greatly distressed for not being able toattend upon Rāma, and she having the eyes of a young hind,being oppressed by the Rākshasees was casting her lookshither and thither. And with a displeased countenance,having dark-blue and curling eye lashes, and eyes full of tears, shewas sighing again and again. Worthy of wearing ornamentsbut now without any, poorly, crusted with execrations, sheappeared like the rays of the stars enveloped by dark-blueclouds. And beholding Sitā in that pitiable plight like untolearning for want of practice, (Hanumān) was puzzled withdoubts. And seeing her without ornaments he could withgreat difficulty make her out like unto words having differentmeanings without the knowledge of grammar. Andbeholding that blameless daughter of the king, having expansiveeyes, Hanumān, by various reasonings, reflected—\"Forsoothshe must be Sitā. I see at her person all these ornaments,of which Rāma mentioned unto me at the time of mydeparture. I behold on her ears excellent ear-rings and nicelyplaced Svadangstras319 and on her arms jewelled ornamentsrendered dark-blue by dirt for constant use. Verily theseare the ornaments Rāma mentioned unto me. I do notperceive them which had been cast off by her. But these arethe rest there is not the least doubt about it. The monkeyshad seen, her excellent yellow cloth made of golden fibres,on the hill. They had seen also her excellent ornaments,which cast off by her, fell on the earth with a sound. Hercloth hath been shattered by constant use but her grace hathnot been rendered worse than its color. This one having agolden countenance must be the beloved queen of Rāma, who,albeit separated from him, hath not disappeared from his mind.This is that damsel on whose account Rāma beingsimultaneously burnt by affection, pity, grief and amour,—affection inconsequence of his beloved spouse being ravished, pity forhis inability to protect one dependent on him, grief for theloss of his beloved wife and amour for his dear one. Verilyit appeareth from the grace of her person, from her welldeveloped limbs and from Rāma's beauty that this worshipfuldamsel having dark-blue eyes must be his spouse. She hasher mind fixed in him, and he in her and it is for this thatshe and the virtuous-souled (Rāma) have been stillmaintaining their being. Indeed my master Rāma hath performeda mighty task for breathes he still in her separation, withoutconsuming himself in grief.\" And having beheld Sitā inthis plight, that son of the Wind-god approached Rāma inmind and showered praises on his master."

  "Āranya, Kishkindhā, and Sundara Kāndam": "And having eulogized Sitā, worthy of being praised andRāma, endeared by accomplishments that foremost ofmonkeys again engaged in meditation. And having reflectedfor some time, the powerful Hanumān, having his eyes fullof tears bewailed on Sitā's account (in the following strain)—\"No one can withstand the course of destiny since Sitā,being the spouse of the worshipful brother of Lakshmana,ever obedient unto his elders, hath been overwhelmedwith grief. The worshipful damsel is cognizant of theprowess of Rāma and the intelligent Lakshmana and forthis she is not entirely depressed like unto the riverGanges at the approach of the rainy season. As regardstheir character, age, conduct, family and other auspiciousmarks they are equal and hence Rāghava deserveth Vaidehiand this one of dark-blue eyes is his.\" And having seen her,gold-hued and conducing to the happiness of the peoplelike unto the Goddess of wealth, Hanumān approachedRāma in his mind and said:—\"For this (damsel) was killedthe mighty Vāli and Kavanda—Rāvana's equal in prowess.(For her too) was destroyed in battle, the terribly powerfulRākshasa—Virādha, by Rāma putting forth his energy, like untoShambara killed by Mahendra. (It was for her) that fourteenthousand Rākshasas of terrible deeds were destroyed atJanasthāna with arrows resembling the flame of fire. AndKhara was killed in battle, and Trisharā was discomfitted andthe mighty Dushana by Rāma, knowing his ownself. And itwas on her account that Sugriva, known all over the world,came by the wealth of the monkeys hard to acquire andamassed by Vāli. And it is for this (damsel) of expansiveeyes that I have crossed the effulgent lord of rivers and haveseen this city. And methinks it would have been all properhad Rāma turned on her account the whole earth boundedby oceans. If the kingdom over the three worlds and thedaughter of Janaka be compared together, the former is notequal to one hundredth part of Sitā. This Sitā, the daughterof the high-souled Janaka, the pious King of Mithilā, firmlyattached unto her husband, rose, covered with dust, out ofthe earth, in a field delved by a furrow. She is thewell-known eldest daughter-in-law of the king Daçaratha, ofan adorable character and unchecked prowess. And She isthe beloved spouse of the pious and grateful Rāma,knowing his ownself, and has been brought under the control of theRākshasees. Renouncing all luxuries, and considering notthe least about miseries, she actuated by her husband's loveentered the solitary forest. And satisfied with fruits and rootsand ever engaged in her husband's service, she lived in theforest as much delighted as she was in her house. Andthat one of a golden hue, never used to afflictions and whowas wont to converse always with a delighted countenance,hath now been suffering incomparable miseries. Like untoa thirsty wight longing for an abode where he might geta drink, Rāghava panteth after seeing her, gifted with anexalted character and oppressed by Rāvana. As a monarchwho had lost his kingdom, is greatly delighted when heregaineth it, forsooth shall Rāghava, in like manner,be pleased when he shall come by her. She too hath beenmaintaining her being in the hope of seeing Rāma again,separated as she is from her friends and deprived of allcomforts and luxuries. These Rākshasees, and these treesenveloped with fruits and flowers—forsooth she doth notbehold, but is engaged with all her heart in medidationsonly touching Rāma. Husband enhanceth the beauty ofa female more than the dress (and therefore Sitā) beautifulas she is, doth not appear graceful, in her husband's absence.Forsooth my master Rāma hath performed a difficult act forhe hath been still keeping up his life in her separationwithout consuming himself in grief. My heart is greatlypained knowing that she, having dark-blue eyes, resemblinglotus petals, worthy of happiness, hath been possessed bygrief. She, patient as the Earth, having eyes resemblinglotuses, who was ere this protected by Rāghava andLakshmana, is now being guarded by Rākshasees havingterrible eyes, under the trees. Being harassed with continuedmiseries, the daughter of Janaka hath lost all her beautylike unto a water-lily crushed with frost, and hath come bya miserable plight like unto a doe seperated from her mate.The branches of the Asoka trees, lowered down with flowersare as if enhancing her grief as also the Moon of manythousand rays, at the expiry of the winter.\" Havingreflected thus and arrived at the conclusion that she was Sitā,that powerful leader of monkeys gifted with velocity stationedhimself on that tree."

With a view to befriendhim, the Moon of clear rays, sprinkled the Wind-God's son,with cool beams. And thereupon he beheld Sitā, having amoon-like countenance, plunged in grief like unto a ladenboat sunk in water. While beholding Vaidehi, Hanumān,the sonof Maruta, observed at some distance, a number of grim-visagedRākshasees. Some had one ear, some one eye, some had bigears some were without ears; some had formidable ears andsome had a nose projecting upwards. And some had theupper part of their bodies unusually long and bulky, some hada long and slender neck, some had dishevelled hair, andsome one's person was so thickly covered with hairs, that sheappeared to have been cloaked in a blanket. Some had longears some had a long forehead, some had a long belly, somehad long breasts; some had long lips; some had their lips andchins stuck together, some had a long countenance and somehad long knees. Some one was of short stature, some weretall, some crooked, some grim-visaged, some dwarfish, someone was of terribly dark colour; some had a disfiguredcountenance; some had coppery eyes and a fearful face. Somewere terrible-looking, some copper-colored, some black, someangry and some fond of quarrelling with each other; andsome had iron darts, hammers and mallets in their hands.Some had a face like that of a boar, some had a face likethat of a deer, some like that of a tiger, some like that of abuffallo, some like that of a goat, and some like that of ajackal; some had legs like those of a camel, some had thoseof an elephant, some those of a horse and some hadtheir heads placed on their breasts. Some one had only onehand some had only one leg. Some had ears like those of ahorse, some like those of a cow, some like those of an ass,some like those of an elephant and others had ears like thoseof a lion. Some had very big noses, some had crookedand others were without any; some had noses like those ofan elephant and others had their noses on their foreheads.Some had their legs like those of elephants some had veryhuge legs; some had like those of a cow, some had on theirlegs locks of hair like unto pillars, some had a terribly hugehead, some had big breasts and others had spacious bellies,Some had faces and eyes beyond ordinary proportions. Somehad a long face and tongue. And some had the face of agoat, some that of an elephant some that of a cow, somethat of a boar some that of a horse and some that of an ass.Some of the Rākshasees were grim-visaged and somehot-natured, quarrelsome and had darts and maces in their hands.And some terrible Rākshasees of disfigured countenances,had smoky-coloured hairs. And they were all continuallydrinking wine—always fond of liquor and meat, and alltheir bodies were sprinkled with blood for their livingon gore and flesh. And that foremost of monkeysfound all these grim-visaged Rākshasees seated aroundthat mighty tree enveloped with branches. And thegraceful Hanumān observed at the foot of that tree thatworshipful and blameless daughter of the king Janaka. Shewas bereft of all effulgence, racked with grief and allher hairs were soiled with dirt. She appeared like a star fallendown on the earth on the wane of virtue. And famed thoughshe was all over the world for her chastity, it was difficultfor her now to see her husband. She had no excellentornaments—her attachment unto her husband was the onlyornament. She was imprisoned by the lord of Rākshasasand separated from all her friends, she appeared like ashe-elephant separated from her band and bound and attackedby a lion, and like the rays of the Moon enveloped withclouds at the expiry of the rainy season. Her beauty wasgreatly faded (in consequence of her husband'sseparation) like unto a stringed instrument for want of a player.And ever engaged in her husband's welfare she wasthoroughly unworthy of being brought under the controlof the Rākshasas. Being sunk in the abyss of grief andencircled by those Rākshasees she appeared in the forestof Asoka like unto Rohini possessed by Rāhu. AndHanumān beheld her there like a creeper divested of flowers.And having her person soiled with dirt and shorn of allornaments she appeared in her hidden grace like unto alotus covered with clay. And the monkey Hanumān, beheldthat damsel, having the eyes of a young antelope, clothedwith a soiled and shattered cloth. And though thecountenance of that worshfpful one was shorn of all grace, herheart did not loose its loftiness in consequence of herhusband's prowess. And Sitā, of dark-blue eyes, was protectedby virtue of her own character. And beholding Sitā, havingthe eyes of a young antelope, and terrified and casting herlooks hither and thither like a hind and burning down thetrees enveloped with leaves by her breath; like unto a mass ofgrief and an upheaval of sorrow; having well-proportionedlimbs, and appearing graceful without ornaments, Mārutiattained to an excess of delight. And beholding her havinginebriete eyes, Hanumān shed tears of delight and bowedunto Rāghava. And having offered his obeisance unto Rāmaand Lakshmana the powerful Hanumān, greatly delightedin seeing Sitā; remained there hidden."

And at that late hour of the night, he heard thechantings of the Vedas by the Rākshasas, conversant withthe six supplementary parts of the Vedas,320 engaged in theperformance of sacrificial rites and knowing Brahmā. Andthereupon the mighty Ten-headed Rākshasa, having huge arms,awoke with the sounds of those auspicious instrumentspleasant unto ears. And awaking, that great and powerfullord of Rākshasas, having his cloth and garlands loosened,began to think of Vaidehi. And that Rākshasa, puffed upwith pride, was passionately attached unto her and so hecould not restrain his amour in him. And so adorned withall ornaments, he, casting his looks on the roads containingjewelled and golden gates and appearing in grace, entered theforest of Asoka, filled with various trees containing fruits andflowers of all seasons and with ponds; beautified with variousflowers; variegated with inebriete and wondrous birds; filledwith various beautiful wolves; thronged with various deerand covered with fruits fallen on the earth. And onehundred damsels followed in the train of the son of Pulastya321like unto the damsels of the celestials and Gandharvasfollowing Mahendra. And among those fair ones, somecarried chowries and some fans. And some carrying waterin golden jars headed the train while others carrying thegolden throne covered with a coverlet followed it. And afavourite damsel carried in her right hand a jewelleddrinking bowl filled with wine. And another carrying the whiteumbrella having golden ribs resembling the full moon andgoose, followed in the train. And in this wise the excellentwives, of Rāvana, having their eyes rendered sleepy withsleep and wine, followed their heroic husband like untolightnings following the cloud. Their necklaces and keyuras weredisplaced, paste faded, hair dishevelled and they had dropsof sweat on their faces. With sleep and intoxication, werereeling those fair ones of beautiful countenances, havingtheir hairs with garlands disbanded and their persons wetwith perspiration. And in this way those beloved wives, (ofRāvana) having inebriete eyes, followed, out of amour andreverence, their husband. And their mighty husband, broughtunder the control of amour and having his mind firmlyattached unto Sitā, proceeded slowly. And that monkey, sonof Māruta, heard the sound of kanchees and nupuras of thoseexcellent damsels. And the monkey Hanumān also beheldRāvana, of extraordinary deeds and of inconceivableprowess and strength, at the gate. His whole body wasseen on all sides by the light of the lamps lighted withperfumed oil and carried by the Rākshasees before. He wasinflamed with amour, pride and haughtiness and hisexpansive eyes were coppery and idle. And he appeared likeCupid himself just appearing in view, leaving behind hisbow and arrows. And holding his excellent robe, coveredwith flowers, washed, set with jewels and white as thefoam of the churned nectar, he placed it in its proper place.And Hanumān, hiding himself on the tree, in the midst of manyleaves and flowers, tried to recognise him as heapproached. And beholding him, that foremost of monkeys saw thathighly famous king Rāvana, surrounded by his excellentlybeautiful and youthful wives, enter that forest of enjoymentfilled with birds and animals. There was a warder by nameSankukarna in that forest—highly powerful, wearing variousornaments and addicted to drinking. And by him wasseen that lord of Rākshasas—the son of Visravasa. Andthat highly energetic monkey beheld that effulgent (Rāvana)surrounded by excellent damsels like unto moon encircledby stars. And beholding him the monkey reflected—\"Thismust be Rāvana—for he is the person whom I saw sleepingin an excellent apartment in that city.\" Thinking this, thathighly effulgent son of Māruta—Hanumān leaped (high uponanother branch). And effulgent as he was, that highlyintelligent monkey hid himself on a branch covered withleaves, being unable to stand before the effulgence of thatRākshasa. And Rāvana proceeded in that way, being anxiousto behold the blue-eyed Sitā, having spacious breast,excellent hips and a lock of black hair."

And having covered her belly with her legsand her breast with her hands, that one, having charmingcolour and expansive eyes, cried aloud. And arriving therethe Ten-necked one beheld Vaidehi, guarded by theRākshasees, poorly, racked with grief like unto a boat sunk inan ocean. Subject to hard penances, she, seated on thebare earth, appeared like a branch of a tree fallen on theground. Her limbs, where she used to wear ornaments, werecovered with dirt and albeit worthy of ornaments, appearedwithout any like unto a lotus covered with clay and thereforeshining very indistinctly. And she was proceeding as it wereunto that lion of a king—Rāma, knowing his own-self, in hermind's charriot drawn by the horses of resolution. And notbeholding the end of her grief, that damsel, attached untoRāma, was keeping alone and reduced to a skeleton andoverwhelmned with anxious thoughts and grief. And shewas troubled like unto the daughter-in-law of the lord ofserpents, of impeded course by means of incantations, andstricken with grief like unto Rohini, possessed by Ketu. Andalthough born in a pious family, well behaved andgood-natured and married according to their rites, she appearedto have been sprung from a low race and wedded accordingto their base ceremonials. She seemed like mighty famedisappearing, like respect disregarded, like intellect waningand hope disappointed; like a sacred altar trampled, likeroyal mandate disobeyed, like the quarters burnt by afire-brand; like offerings unto God soiled; like the disc of thefull-moon stricken with darkness, a lotus distressed, an armywithout a leader; like the ravs of the moon enveloped withgloom, like a river of shallow water, like a sacrificial altarpossessed by an outcast, like the flame of fire extinguished;like water fowls terrified and lotuses disturbed and petalscrushed by the trunks of elephants. And her grace greatlyfamished by the absence of her husband she appeared like ariver whose liquid contents were dried up. And notcleaning her limbs she appeared like a dark night. And that oneof graceful limbs, tender and worthy of living in a jewelledabode, being stricken with grief, seemod like a driedlotus-stalk just extracted from its bed. And she like thedaughter-in-law of the lord of elephants, caught, separated from her bandand tied to a pillar, was overwhelmed with grief and was sighingagain and again. A long lock of dark-blue hair, taken not theleast care of, was on her back; and with this she appeared likeunto the earth covered with dark-blue forests at the expirationof the rainy season. With fasts and grief, anxiety and fear, shewas greatly weakened and reduced and gave up eating andtook recourse to asceticism only. Stricken with grief, sheseemed to have been offering prayers unto that foremostof Raghus for the destruction of the Ten-necked one, likethose unto the deities with folded hands. And beholdingblameless Maithilee, having expansive eyes with beautifuleye lashes, greatly attached unto Rāma, and weeping,Rāvana tempted her for his own destruction."

O Sitā, here is no humanbeing or any Rākshasa assuming shapes at will, do thoutherefore renounce all fear from me. O timid damsel,for certain it is the virtue of the Rākshasas that they alwaysvisit others' wives or come by them by force. In spite ofthis, O Maithilee, I do not touch thee for thou art not underthe influence of amour—but for me, I am completely underits sway. Do not fear me, O worshipful damsel, confide in me,O my beloved one, and become attached unto me. Donot give way to grief.

Have thy eyes always on religion and do thoufollow in the track of piety. Like unto thine own wives,others' are worthy of being protected by thee, O ranger ofthe night. Making an example of thee, do thou enjoy withthy own wives. Forsooth those vicious-minded, those ofagitated senses, who are not satisfied with their own wives,are brought to misery by others' wives. (Methinks) thereare no pious men here and even if there be any thou dost notfollow him since thou hast such an adverse understanding,against human practice and usage. Or the considerate peoplehave spoken the truth, but thou, for the destruction of therace of the Rākshasas, considering that false, hast notfollowed it. Wealth, kingdom and cities—all are brought tonaught when they are placed at the hands of a vicious andilliterate king. Obtaining thee, (therefore) as her king andfor thy folly only, this city of Lankā, abounding in jewels,shall soon be ruined. O Rāvana, every one delighteth inthe destruction of that inconsiderate being, who bringethabout his own destruction and is engaged in the perpetrationof evil deeds. And in this way, thyself, the perpetrator ofvicious acts, meeting with thy end, those persons who hadbeen tyranized by thee, shall, delightedly, say—\"Oh! blessedare we since this terrible (Rākshasa) hath met with his end.With wealth or riches thou shalt not be able to tempt me.As the rays of the sun belong to him, so I am Rāghava'sonly. Having laid my head on the beautiful arms of thatlord of men, how shall I place it again on another's? Likeunto the knowledge of one God monopolized by theBrahmanas only, I am the spouse of that lord of earth only, cognisantof higher truths and marrying me according to the piousceremonials. May good betide thee, O Rāvana. Do thoutake me unto Rāma, stricken with grief as I am, like untoa she-elephant anxiously waiting in the forest brought to thelord of elephants. It behoveth thee to make friends withRāma, that best of men, if dost thou desire to maintain thyempire and dost not wish to bring about thy own destruction.It is known to the world, that Rāma knoweth well thesanctions of religion and is kind unto them who seek hisshelter. Do thou seek his friendship, if dost thou wish tomaintain thy life. Do thou propitiate him therefore who iskind to his dependents and it becometh thee to take merespectfully unto him. Thou shalt meet with thy well-beingif dost thou in this wise confer me on that best of Raghus.And mighty is the disaster that shall befall thee, if dost thoufollow any other procedure. Thunderbolt, even, when hurled,may leave thee, Death himself may overlook thee—but thereis no safety for thee, if Rāghava. the lord of men is enraged.Thou shalt hear the terrible sound of the twang of Rāma'sbow, like unto the sound of the thunderbolt hurled by Indra.Soon shall arrows, bearing the names of Rāma and Lakshmanaand having fiery heads like those of snakes, alight here.And covered with kanka leaves they shall undoubtedly coverthe whole city and devastate it by destroying all theRākshasas. Like unto Garuda pulling up the snakes, theGaruda-like Rāma shall pull up thy snake-like Rākshasas. Andlike unto Vishnu recovering the effulgent Sree (the Goddessof wealth) from the Asuras, by crossing over the three worldswith three foot-steps, my husband, the conqueror of foes, shallrecover me from thee. Janasthāna hath been devastated, the hostof Rākshasas hath been killed, and thou hast been disabled.Truly thou hast perpetrated an impious deed. O Rākshasa,those two lions among men going out to enquire about theillusive deer, I was ravished by thee, entering the emptyhermitage, O vile wight. And like unto a dog incapableof standing before a tiger, it would have been impossiblefor thee, to wait there in the presence of Rāma andLakshmana. If dost thou engage in conflict with them, thywealth and friends shall be of no avail unto thee (andthou shalt be dis-comfitted) like unto one-handed AsuraVitra by the two handed Indra.324 Soon shall my husband,with the assistance of Lakshmana, draw out thy life witharrows, like unto the sun drying up, by his rays, shallowwater. Whether dost thou repair to the abode of Kuvera,or whether dost thou, terrified, take refuge unto the assemblyof Varuna, thou shalt, for certain, be destroyed by the sonof Daçaratha, like unto a mighty tree broken down bythunderbolt."

  "Āranya, Kishkindhā, and Sundara Kāndam": "Hearing those harsh accents, that lord of Rākshasas,replied unto Sitā, of comely presence, with the followingunpleasant words—\"It is generally found on earth thatthe more a woman is courted by a man, the more she isbrought under his influence. (But for thee) the more kindlyI have been behaving towards thee, the more roughly I havebeen treated. Truly doth my love for thee keep in controlthe wrath like unto a good charioteer restraining theswerving stead. O mighty is amour unto men, for onwhom this amour falleth, albeit she is an object of wrath,becomes an object of kindness and affection. O thou offair countenance, it is for this reason, that I do not destroythee, although thou, who art engaged in false asceticism, artworthy of being killed and dishonored. O Maithilee, for eachand every one of all those harsh words which thou hastused by me, dost thou deserve death.\" Having spokenthus unto Vaidehi, Rāvana, the lord of Rākhasas, havinghis wrath subdued, again bespake Sitā: \"I shall waitfor those two months, of which I have made a contract,after which thou shalt have to share my bed, O thou of acomely presence. And even then if thou dost refuse to regardme as thy husband, my cooks shall mince thy limbs withsteel and serve thee for my morning meal.\" Beholdingthe lord of Rākshasas remonstrate with the daughter ofJanaka in this wise, the daughters of the celestials andGandharbas became exceedingly sorry. Some with lips, somewith eyes, and some with gestures of their faces, they allconsoled Sitā, thus distressed by that Rākshasa. And thusconsoled by them, and being proud of her good conduct and herhusband's heroism, Sitā thus addressed Rāvana, the lordof Rākshasas, \"Forsooth there is no person in this citywho desireth thy welfare and therefore preventeth thee fromsuch an impious deed. Who is there in the three worlds,who even dcsireth me in mind, who am the spouse of thevirtuous-souled (Rāma) like unto Indra's Sachee. O thouthe vilest of the Rākshasas, for using those vicious wordstowards the spouse of Rāma, of immeasured prowess,repairing whither shalt thou escape vengeance? Like untoan infuriated elephant encountering a hare in the forest, thoushalt O Vile! a hare as thou art, meet with thatelephant-like Rāma. Thou art not ashamed of railing that lord ofIkshwākus, so long as dost thou not come within his ken.O base! why do not thy grim, terrible, coppery eyes, lookingso viciously at me, fall down on earth. O vicious wretch,I am the spouse of that virtuous souled (Rāma) anddaughter-in-law of Daçaratha—using these vile words towardsme, why dost not thy tongue fall off? O Ten-neckedone, I can instantly reduce thee to ashes but for Rāma'smandate and my ascetic observances. Thou couldst not haveravished me in the presence of the highly intelligent Rāma.And undoubtedly for thy destruction this hath been broughtabout by God. Thou art heroic and Kuvera's brother andgreat in prowess, why didst thou then take me by stealthafter despatching Rāma away from the hermitage?\"Hearing those words of Sitā, Rāvana, the lord of Rākshasas,whirling his grim eyes, looked towards the daughter of Janaka.He was like unto a mass of blue clouds and his arms andnecks were long and spacious. He was gifted withelephantine gaits and his tongues and eyes were sharp and flaming.The top of his crown was shaking and he had charminggarlands around his neck and his person sprinkled with paste.He had crimson-coloured garlands and clothes on and hischarming arms were adorned with ornaments. Encircledwith a sword-belt around his waist he appeared like untoMandara, entwined by a snake at the time of the churningof the ocean. With his two plump arms, that lord ofRākshasas appeared like unto the hill Mandara with its twohuge summits. And adorned with a pair of Kundalas325resembling the newly risen Sun he looked like a hill covered withtwo Asoka trees enveloped with crimson flowers and leaves.He was like unto Kalpa326 tree and spring incarnate.And albeit adorned, he looked terrible like unto a Caitya327 onthe cremation-ground. And having his eyes red hot with ire,sighing again and again like unto a snake and casting hislooks upon Sitā, Rāvana addressed her again, saying,—\"Othou following asceticism, this thy vow is without anymeaning and beyond the pale of morality. Even shall Idestroy thee to-day like unto the Sun dispelling darknesswith his rays.\" Having thus addressed Maithilee, theinimical king Rāvana cast his looks towards the grim-visagedRākshasees. And among those Rākshasees, some had hugeears, some had ears like those of kine, some had ears as long asarms, some had long ears and others were without any. Andsome had legs like those of an elephant; some had like those ofa cow and some had legs covered with hairs. And some hadone eye, some had one leg, some had capacious legs and somewere without any. And some had huge heads and necks andsome had breast and belly beyond proportions and some hadfaces and eyes above human size. Some had huge tonguesand nails. And some were without noses. And some hadleonine faces, some had faces like those of kine and somehad those of boars. And casting his look towards suchRākshasees, he said—\"Ye Rākshasees, do ye all endeavourto bring Sitā, the daughter of Janaka, under my control.By good or bad conduct, by conciliation or gift, by threat orblandishment, do ye so endeavour as Vaidehi's soul might bebent unto me.\" And having ordered thus again and again,that lord of Rākshasas, stricken with amour and ire,addressed Sitā, roaring fiercely. And thereupon approaching speedilyand embracing the Ten-necked one, one Rākshasee namedDhānyamalini bespake him:—\"Do thou sport with me, Ogreat king. What shalt thou do with her?—O lord ofRākshasas—a human being,poorly and of a pale countenance.O great king, forsooth, the celestials have not destined forher enjoyment all those objects which thou hast procuredby thy prowess. And again he who desireth for an unwillingdame burneth his own person—and he who desireth for awilling damsel, attaineth excess of delight.\" Having saidthis, the Rākshasee took away Rāvana by force. And thatRākshasa too, resembling a mass of clouds, laughing, turnedback. And that Ten-necked one, strode away as if shaking thewhole earth and passed within (his queen's) abode resemblingthe effulgent Sun. And encircling Rāvana those daughtersof celestials Gandharbas and Nāgas, entered into anexcellent abode. And having remonstrated with and left behind,the firm and pious Sitā with a trembling person, Rāvana,possessed by amour entered into his own palace."

And after that lord of Rākshasas had goneaway and entered his inner apartment, the hideousRākshasees drew near Sitā. And approaching Sitā that terriblehost, almost faint with ire, addressed Vaidehi with thefollowing harsh words—\"Thou dost not regard it highly,Sitā, that thou shalt become the chosen wife of thathigh-souled, and great Rāvana, the Ten-necked son of Pulastya.\"Thereupon another Rākshasee name4 Ekjatā, with eyesrendered coppery with ire, addressing Sitā, having a smallnavel, said,—\"Pulastya is the fourth of the six Prajāpatis,328a mind-born son of Brahmā and celebrated in the world.And the glorious ascetic, by name Bishravā. was themind-born son unto Pulastya, effulgent like unto Prajāpatis.

Dost thou not desire tobe his wife, who is heroic, of indomitable prowess andwho doth not turn back in battle? And turning away inscorn from his beloved wife, highly esteemed, the mightyking Rāvana, desireth for thee. And leaving his innerapartment enriched with thousand of females and adornedwith various jewels, Rāvana shall adore thee.\" And thenfollowed another Rakshasee by name Bikatā—\"The king,who by his terrible prowess subdued the Gandharbas329 andNāgas330 in battle, hath stood by thee. O foolish damsel,why dost thou not wish to be the consort of that high-souledlord of Rākshasas—Rāvana, gifted with wealth and riches.\"And then followed another Rakshasee named Durmukhee.—\"Why dost thou not approach him, O thou having expansiveeyes, by whose fear, the sun doth not shine, and the winddoth not blow. O dame, why dost thou not wish to be theconsort of Rāvana, the lord of Rākshasas, at whose commandthe trees shower blossoms and the hills and clouds pourdown water.

O woman, thou regardest highly to be the wife ofa man. Do thou turn back from Rāma—thy desire shallnever be satisfied. Do thou spend happily thy days withour lord—Rāvana, the Rākshasa chief, who makes his ownthe treasures of the three worlds. Thou art a woman, Othou of comely presence, and therefore doth thy fancy clingto Rāma, O thou of a blameless countenance, who is a man,deprived of his kingdom, overwhelmed with disasters andhath his desires frustrated.\" Hearing the words of thoseRākshasees, the lotus-eyed Sitā, with her eyes full of tearssaid.—\"What ye have all said and which is against humanusage and vicious, doth not find place in my mind. Awoman cannot be the wife of a Rākshasa. Eat me up ifyou will, I will never follow your words. Poor or deprivedof kingdom, he who is my hunband, is my preceptor.

And Hanumān remained all along speechless andhidden on the Shingshapa tree. And that monkey heard allthose demons remonstrate with Sitā in this way. And those,influenced with ire, approached the trembling Sitā andencircling her, licked again and again their long and burninglips. And taking up instantly spears, they exceedingly wroth,menaced her, saying—\"She is not worthy of having Rāvana, thelord of the Rākshasas, as her lord.\" Being thus remonstratedwith by those terrible Rākshasees, that excellent damsel,shedding tears, neared the Singshapa tree. And thelarge-eyed Sitā, encircled by the Rākshasees, remained there sunkin grief. And all those hideous demons, showered reproaches,from all sides, on her, greatly reduced, of a poorlycountenance, and wearing a soiled cloth. Thereupon a grim-visageddemon, angry, having hideous teeth and a huge belly extendingdownwards, by name Vinatā, spake, saying:—\"O Sitā, thouhast shown enough of attachment towards thy husband.But, O gentle dame, excess of any thing tends to evil. Weare satisfied. And may good betide thee! Thou hast actedworthily like a woman. Do thou hear, O Maithilee, whatI say for thy welfare. Do thou accept, Rāvana, the lord ofthe Rākshasa host, as thy husband. He withstandspowerfully his enemies like unto Vāsava, the lord of the celestials,charitable, kind unto all, and sweet-speeched. Andforsaking Rāma, a poor wight, do thou take Rāvana (as thyhusband). Having thy person sprinkled with celestial pasteand adorned with excellent ornaments, do thou from to-dayO Vaidchi, O thou of comely presence, become the queen ofall the worlds, like unto Sachee of the lord of the celestialsand svāha332 of the fire.

This is what I sayand if dost thou not follow it we shall all instantly banqueton thee.\" And thereupon another Rākshasee named Vikatā,having her breast hanging long, exercised with ire, andclinching her fist, addressed, roaring, Sitā—\"O foolishdaughter of the king of Mithilā, we have put up with all thyfoolish words only out of compassion, and because thou arta feeble being. It will not lead to thy well-being if thoudost not hear our words. Thou hast been brought here, theother side of the ocean, difficult of being approached byothers. Thou hast come within the terrible abode of RāvanaO Maithilee, and hast been shut up in his room guarded byus all. And even, Purandara's333 self cannot save you. Dothou therefore hear, O Maithilee, my well-meaning words.Why dost thou shed tears? Renounce thy useless grief.Do thou become happy and delighted, renouncing thycontinued melancholy. Do thou sport, O Sitā, at thy pleasure,with the lord of the Rākshasas. We know, for certain, Otimid damsel, that the youth of the females, is very transient.And so long as thy youth doth not fade, do thou pass thy dayshappily, O thou having inebrite eyes, with the lord ofRākshasas, in picturesque gardens, and mountain forests.Do thou take, O fair damsel, Rāvana, the lord of theRākshasas, for thy husband, and thousands of females shall be placedat thy service. If dost thou not follow, what I say, OMaithilee, I shall taking out thy heart, banquet on it.\"Thereupon another grim-visaged Rākshasee, named,Chandodorā, shaking her terrible spear, said—\"Beholdingthis Sitā having the eyes of a young antelope and her breasttrembling with fear, my earnest desire, as I am enciente,hath been to banquet on her large eyes, lever, spleen, herplump hands, heart, other limbs and head.\" Thereuponanother Rākshasee named Praghasā said—\"I shall grindthe throat of this cruel woman. What are you doing, sittingthere? Ye shall then relate unto the king that the womanis dead. And undoubtedly he shall say 'Do ye eat her up.'\"And thereupon another Rākshasee named Ajāmukhee said\"I do not like quarrels. Let us all divide her into equalportions.

And being thus addressed by thoseRākshasees, Vaidehi, of subdued soul, being greatly terrified, said,having her voice choked with vapour,—\"A woman can neverbe the wife of a Rākshasa. Eat me up if you will, I shallnever follow your words.\" And being surrounded by theRākshasees and threatened by Rāvana, Sitā, resembling thedaughter of a celestial, stricken with grief, could not consoleherself. And trembling, she shrank from their presence likeunto a strayed fawn surrounded by wolves. And resortingto a flowery branch of an Asoka tree, she sunk in grief,thought upon her lord. With tears she bathed her beautifulbreast and oppressed with woe, she could not reach the otherbank of the ocean of grief. Like a plantain tree shaken by thebreeze, she shook and fell down trembling (on the earth).And being afraid of the Rākshasees, her cheeks forsook theirnative hue. And herself trembling, her pretty long lock ofhair also shook and appeared like a serpent moving this wayand that. Overwhelmed with grief and beside herself withire, the daughter of the king of Mithilā, wept and exclaimedsorrowfully,—\"O mother Kausalyā!

Oh blest are they who havebeen resting their eyes upon my grateful and sweet-speechedlord of leonine gaits, having eyes resembling lotus petals!And separated frpm Rāma of subdued soul, it is as difficultfor me to breathe as for him who hath drank up virulentpoison. What mighty iniquity had I perpetrated in myprevious existence that I have met with this terrible disaster!I wish to renounce my life under this load of grief—but alas!I am surrounded by the Rākshasees and cannot meet Rāma.Oh! cursed is this subject human life, that they cannotrenounce it even at their pleasure\"!"

And she began to roll on the earth like untoa colt as if she was mad, possessed by a devil and had losther sense. \"I, the spouse of Rāma, who was drawn awayat a distance by the Rākshasa (Māricha) assuming shapesat will, was seized and borne away by Rāvana. A captiveof the Rākshasas, subject to their terrible threats and taunts,sunk in grief and anxiety,—I desire not to keep my life. Ofwhat avail are wealth, ornament and life unto me, who amliving in the midst of the Rākshasas and separated fromRāma, of the mighty car? Forsooth my life is made ofstone, imperishable and immortal since it is not riven asundereven by this mighty grief. Woe to me! who am unchasteand vile and my life is vicious, since breathe I still in theabsence of my lord. What of fixing my fancy on thatnight-ranger, my meaner foot even shall not touch him? That(demon) who is courting me in this terrible way, dothnot know himself, his own race and that I loathe him somuch. What more shall I speak unto you, I shall neverconsent to Rāvana's prayer, I might be rent from limb to limbor burnt in fire. Rāghava is grateful, true, wise and kind.I fear it is through my ill-luck that he doth not feel pity forme. Will he not take me back who alone slew thethousands of the Rashasas in Janasthāna? I have been capturedby Rāvana, a Rākshasa of feeble prowess. Forsooth mylord is capable of slaying this Rāvana in conflict. Willnot that Rāma regain me, by whom was killed in theforest of Dandaka, Virādha, the foremost of the Rākshasacrew? Although situated in the midst of the ocean, Lankāis unapproachable by others, but Rāghava's arrows shall alsoreach here. (I am at a loss to ascertain) why Rāma offirm prowess, doth not regain me, his beloved spouse whohave been borne away by the Rākshasa. Methinks Rāmadoth not know that I am here, or else, powerful as he is, hewould not have put up with this insult. That lord of vultures,who could have informed Rāghava, of my being borne awayby the Rākshasa, was killed by Rāvana in the battle. Ogreat was the work done by him, who, old as he was, for mysake, addressed himself to bring about Rāvana's destruction.If Rāghava could know that I was here, he, exceedinglywroth, would have cleared the earth with his arrows, of theRākshasas. He would have then burnt down the city of Lankā,dried up the deep and blotted out the name and fame ofRāvana. And from each ruined home would have risen theRākshasa widows' groans and cries like unto those of mine.And instituting enquiries, along with Lakshmana, he shallsoon reduce Lankā to this plight. And observed by themthe enemy shall not live for a moment. And in no time,shall Lankā, assume the appearance of a cremation ground,having all her high ways enveloped with smoke issuing out ofthe funeral pyres, and filled with vultures. And soon shall thisdesire of mine be fulfilled. All these words of mine do soundimprobable now but they all indicate your misfortune. Besidesfrom these bad omens, that are to be seen here, it appeareth,that Lankā shall soon be shorn of her grace. The lord of theRākshasas, the vicious Rāvana being killed, forsooth shallLankā, divested of wealth, appear like a widow. This Lankā,which is now full of pious ceremonies, shall, on the death ofthe Rākshasas and their master, appear like a husbandlesswoman. For certain, shall I soon hear the cries and groansin every house, of the daughters of the Rākshasas worn withgrief. If that heroic Rāma, having dark-blue eyes, comes toknow that I am in the abode of the Rākshasas, the city ofLankā shall be burnt down with his arrows and shall bestricken with darkness and shorn of grace and all theforemost of the Rākshasas shall be destroyed. The time whichwas appointed by the vile and cruel Rāvana, hath arrived.And that vicious wretch hath resolved to destroy me now.There is no crime which cannot be perpetrated by thosevicious demons. Mighty is the disaster that shall arise onaccount of this crime—the Rākshasas who live on flesh donot know what virtue is. Forsooth shall the Rākshasa serveme for his morning meal. What shall I do without my lordof comely presence? Debarred from my husband's presence,stricken with grief and not beholding Rāma, having dark-blueeyes, I shall soon meet with death. Rāma, the elder brotherof Bharata, doth not know that I am still alive or else heand Lakshmana would have ransacked the whole world forme. Or renouncing his body on this earth for my grief, theheroic elder brother of Lakshmana, hath repaired to thecelestial region. Blessed are the celestials, Gandharbas,Siddhas and mighty ascetics who are beholding my heroiclotus-eyed Rāma. Or that highly intelligent royal asceticdeairous of securing piety and freed from the troubles oflife, hath no need of a wife like me. Or people have fancyfor what they see and which disappeateth as soon as theobject is out of sight. The ungrateful are capable ofrenouncing their love, but not Rāma. Or there might be somefolly in me. Or on the wane of my good luck havebeen separated irom the excellent Rāma. Death is morepreferable unto me than life since I have been separatedtrom the high-souled heroic Rāma, of unblemished characterand the slayer of foes. Or those two brothers, the foremostof men, laying aside their weapons, and living on fruits androots, have been wandering in the forest. Or those twoheroic brothers Rāma and Lakshmana, have been, bytreachery, put to death, by the vicious-souled Rāvana, the lordof Rākshasas. At this time of distress, I do with all my heartlong lor death,—(but alas!) even death is not approachingme in this my misery. Oh blessed are those high-souled,great ascetics abiding by truth and having their senses incontrol, who have no objects of love or displeasure. Theyare not distressed with misery for their objects of love orgrief for them whom they do not love. They are freed fromthem and I do bow unto those high-souled ones. Beingforsaken by the beloved Rāma, knowing his ownself, andbrought under the control of Rāvana, I shall renouncemy life.\""

I sawin my dream to-night, that Sitā, clad in the purest white,appearing on a snow-white hill beaten by the waves of theocean, had at last met Rāma, like unto light joined to theSun. And I again saw Rāma and Lakshmana appear ineffulgence, seated on a huge elephant, having four tusksand resembling a bull. Thereupon those two (brothers),resplendant like unto the Sun by their own effulgence, andwearing white garlands and clothes, appeared near Janaka'sdaughter. And the lotus eyed Jānaki, on the top of the hillsituate on the welkin, first fell on the lap of her husbandand then stationed herself on the neck of the elephantguided by her husband. Then I saw Sitā rubbing the Sun andthe Moon with her two hands. And then that best of theelephants, with those two princes and the large eyed Sitā onhim, stood high above Lankā. I again saw Rāma, clad inwhite, and adorned with garlands, ride along with Lakshmanain a charriot drawn by eight white bullocks. I again sawthat highly energetic, best of men—Rāma, having truth forhis prowess, along with his brother Lakshmana and Sitā fleeto Northern realms, ascending a celestial flowery charriotresembling (in brightness) the Sun. And I saw Rāvana too,shaved and shorn, besmeared with oil, wearing a crimsoncloth, drinking honey, wearing a garland of Karavira flowers,fall down on earth from the flowery charriot. And draggedby a woman, shaved, wearing a red cloth and garlandsand sprinkled with crimson paste, Rāvana was again seenby me riding in a charriot drawn by asses. And quaffing oil,laughing and dancing, that one of agitated senses, forgettinghimself sped on the charriot to the South.335 And I againsaw Rāvana, the lord of the Rākshasas, stricken with fear,fall, headless, down on the earth. And then rising all on asudden, and uttering obscene and inconsistent words like untoa maniac, Rāvana overwhelmed with fear, and amazement,and intoxicated, fell into a mass of dirt, stinking andresembling the very hell. And again proceeding to theSouth he entered into a lake devoid of mud and water. Anda dark woman, clad in a crimson cloth, and bedaubed withmud, dragged the Ten-necked demon, entwining herselfround his neck. Then followed the mighty Kumvakarna336and all the sons of Rāvana, shaved and shorn and besmearedwith oil. And they all proceeded southward—the Ten-neckeddemon on on a boar, Indrajit337 on a porpoise, and Kumvakarnaon a camel. I saw only Biveesana, with a white umbrellaand accompanied by four courtiers, range in the welkin.And there was audible in the large assembly sound of musicand stringed instruments. And all the Rākshasas wearingcrimson clothes and garlands, were quaffing oil. Isaw the royal and picturesque city Lankā with her steeds,cars and elephants, drowned in the ocean, having hergateways and ornamented arches broken. And in Lankā, coveredwith dust, Rākshasa women, laughing; and making terriblesound, were engaged in quaffing oil. I saw all the leadingRākshasas—Kumvakarna and others, dark-hued and wearingcrimson clothes, emerged in an abyss of cow dung. Do yetherefore fly at some distance, and will find that Rāghavashall regain Sitā. And exercised with ire he shall destroyyou all along with the Rākshasas. Rāghava shall neverbrook, his esteemed and beloved spouse, living in the forest,being taunted and threatened by you. No more with roughwords therefore; do you console the lady and humbly prayher to forgive you. This I think proper. Surely shall she,divested of misfortune, be reconciled to her belovedand excellent husband, regarding whom, in her misery, Ihave dreamt such a dream. Ye Rākshasees! You havethreatened her, do ye implore her forgiveness—no morewith harsh words. Forsooth, from Rāghava shall proceedthe mighty disaster of the Rākshasas. If Maithilee, thedaughter of the king Janaka, be pleased with you (foryour imploring her forgiveness) you might be saved fromthe mighty disaster. I do not perceive any inauspiciousmark on the person of this large-eyed dame. It appearsfrom the paleness of her countenance that she hath beenovercome by misfortune. And I saw (in my dreamt thisworshipful damsel, unworthy of any misfortune, stationedin the welkin. Verily I do perceive, before me, the satisfactionof Vaidehi's end, the destruction of the lord of the Rākshasasand the conquest of Rāghava. Behold I there, her left eye,spacious, as a lotus-petal, is dancing to hear this pleasantdream announcing the satisfaction of her own end. And herleft arm is also dancing with joy, all on a sudden. And herexcellent beautiful left thigh, resembling the trunk of anelephant, is also dancing as if indicating, that she shall atno distant date, be reconciled to Rāghava. And the birds,again and again, entering their nests, and highly delightedare pouring forth their notes announcing the advent of ahappy occasion.\" Thereupon that modest dame, greatlydelighted in the prospective conquest of her husband, said—\"If this be true I shall save you all.\""

Threatened by Rāvanaand encircled by the Rākshasees, that timid damsel bewailedlike a girl cast off in a lonely forest. \"Truly the sages saythat death in this world doth not come untimely. Or elsewould I have, vicious as I am, lived for a moment, beingthus sorely threatened. Forsooth, my mind, divested ofhappiness and full of misery, is firm or else why is it notbroken in sunder like unto the summit of a hill clappedby a thunderbolt. Nor am I to blame for this—I am worthyof being killed by this demon of uncomely presence. As aBrahmana cannot impart instructions in Vedas unto the peopleof other castes so I shall not confer my mind on Rāvana.If that lord of the people doth not come within theappointed time, forsooth shall that vile lord, of the Rākshasas, mincemy limbs with his arrows like unto a surgeon cutting offthe limbs of an embryo.339 Two months shall pass away inno time and I shall have to suffer the pain of death,overwhelmed with sorrow as I am, like unto a thief, confined instocks, at the command of the sovereign to receive death thenext morning. Rāma! Lakshmana! O Sumitra! O Rāma'smother! O my mothers! I am worsted in this ocean ofgrief, like unto a bark, driven hither and thither by theblast, in the midst of an ocean. Verily for me, those twopowerful, lion-like sons of the king, have been killed by(this demon) effulgent like the lightning and assuming thesemblance of a deer. Unfortunate as I am, forsooth I wastempted then by death wearing the shape of a deer andthus foolishly lost Rāma and Lakshmana, the sons of theworshipful sire. O Rāma, O thou of truthful vows, O thouof long arms, O thou having the countenance of a full moon!O my life! engaged as thou art in the welfare of the people,dost thou not perceive that I am about to be killed by theRākshasas. Alas! this my devotedness unto my husband, myforgiveness, my lying down on the bare earth, my observanceof religious vows, my wife-like virtues, are lost like untoservice done for an ungrateful wight. In vain are mypious rites, and in vain is my devotedness unto myhusband—since I do not behold thee, am pale and feeble inthy absence and have given up all hopes of seeing thee. Andduly satisfying thy sire's command, and returningsuccessfully from the forest, thou shalt fearlessly sport with manya damsel having large eyes. (But for me) O Rāma, I wasfor my own destruction, devoted, soul and heart, unto thee.Oh! fruitless is my asceticism and wifely virtue! Oh fieon me! I shall renounce this my unfortunate life. I desireto do away speedily with my being by means of poisonor a sharp weapon. But there is no one in this city of theRākshasas, who bringeth me this poison or weapon.\"Bewailing thus in various accents, and remembering Rāma withall her heart, Sitā, having her countenance dried up, andtrembling, got at the biggest tree enveloped with flowers.And thinking thus, Sitā, stricken with grief, took up in herhand, her braid of hair and thought—\"I shall soon hangmyself with this braid and reach the abode of Death. Andthat one of tender person reached the tree, and holding abranch, began to think of Rāma, Lakshmana, and the gloryof her race. And on her person were perceived manyauspicious marks, well-known in the world, removing grief,fostering patience, and announcing the advent of futurewelfare."

And her beautiful, round,plump left hand, which, ere this, sprinkled with costly aguruand sandal, used to serve for a pillow unto Rāma, began todance now again and again after a long time. And her wellbuilt plump left thigh, resembling the trunk of an elephant,dancing, announced that she would soon behold Rāma.And the gold-hued cloth, now covered with dust, of thatdamsel of a comely person, having teeth like pomegranateseeds, slipped a little off its place. And being enlivened bythose and various other auspicious omens, she attained joylike unto a seed, spoiled by the wind and the sun, growingafresh in the rainy season.

Truly have I seen her to-day, engagedas I have been as a spy to estimate the strength of the ememyand am ranging secretly everywhere. I have seen minutely thecity of the Rākshasas, and the strength of Rāvana, the lordof Rākshasasas. It now remains to console the spouse ofRāma of incomparable power, and kind unto all, who pantethfor her lord. I shall console this damsel, having thecountenance of the full moon, who had never seen griefbefore, and who shall not soon reach its end. And if I goaway without soothing this chaste lady, who is almostsenseless with grief, I shall be blamed of neglect of duty. And ifI go away, the royal daughter, the famed Jānaki, finding nomeans of safety, shall, for certain, renounce her life. She isworthy of being consoled like unto the great armed (Rāma)having the countenance of the full-moon and anxious tobehold Sitā. It is not proper to speak before the Rākshasas—What shall I do then? I am in very great difficulty. IfI do not console her at this latter end of the night, surelyshall she renounce her life. How shall I answer Rāma,without consoling Sitā of comely stature, when he willask me \"What message from my Sitā?\" And if I speedilyrepair hence without any information regarding Sitā, surelyshall Kākuthstha scorch me lifeless with the fire of his angryeyes. And if I urge my lord the king (Biveeshana) to bringhis hosts here for Rāma, in vain shall be his toil341. Andseizing the occasion when she shall be free from herdemonaic guards, I shall console her in her dire distress. Anda puny monkey as I am, I shall speak in Sanskrit342 which mendelight to use. And if I speak Sanskrit like a Brahmana, Sitāshall be terrified considering me Rāvana.

And Sitā, making a sudden noise, those terribleRākshasees resembling Death himself and armed with variousweapons, shall at once arrive there. And thereupon castingtheir looks all around and finding me out, those highlypowerful and grim-visaged demons shall try to kill or catch me.And beholding me leap from branch to branch and trunk totrunk of big trees they shall be greatly alarmed. And espyingmy appearance while ranging in the forest, those Rākshaseesgreatly terrified, shall fill the wood with their wild shouts.And then they shall call (to their assistance) all thoseRākshasees engaged in guarding the abode of the lord of theRākshasas. And they, greatly agitated, shall with vehemencearrive here, armed with darts, arrows, scimitars and variousother weapons. And being surrounded by them on all sides,if I do kill that host of demons, tired, I shall not be able tobound over the main. And if that host of skilled demons,succeed in making me a captive, I too shall be in their handsand Sitā shall remain ignorant of my object. Or theRākshasas, pernicious as they are, shall kill the daughter of Janaka,and there shall the great work of Rāma and Sugriva, bespoiled. And Jānaki liveth in this secret place, girt by theocean, guarded on all sides by the Rākshasas, difficult of beinggot at and having all avenues to it shut up. If I am killed orcaptured by Rākshasas in battle, I do not find any who canhelp Rāma in his enterprise. Myself killed, I do not findany monkey who can leap a hundred leagues across the sea.I am capable of destroying thousands of Rākshasas, but Ishall not then be able to get at the other shore of the greatocean. Victory or defeat is uncertain in a battle—I do not(therefore) like to engage in such an uncertain (act). Whatwise man merges certainty in uncertainty? It is a great sinin me (I own) to talk with Sitā—But she will die if I do nottalk with her. Works, almost accomplished, when entrustedto an inconsiderate emissary, are generally spoiled, out ofseason and out of place, like unto darkness driven by theappearance of the sun. All those works, which are generallytaken in hand after duly deliberating over their propriety andimpropriety, are generally spoiled by those emissaries who areproud of their learning. What shall I do, by which my workis not injured, I am not blamed of foolishness and mycrossing over the main doth not become fruitless? What shall I doso that Sitā might listen to me without being terrified?\"Thinking over this, the intelligent Hanumān arrived at a conclusion.\"I shall not disturb her, speaking (all on a sudden) aboutRāma of unwearied actions, dear unto her and to whom,she is firmly attached. Uttering the name of Rāma, theforemost of the Ikshawkus, and of subdued soul and laudinghis piety and fame in sweet accents, I shall so manage thatSitā might hear and believe them.\" Beholding the spouseof that high-souled lord of the earth and engaging in thistrain of thoughts, Hanumān, stationed on a branch of the tree,spoke the following sweet words."

His eldest and most beloved son was theMoon-bright Rāma, wise and the foremost of those who know thescience of the bended bow. He was the protector of his owncharacter, of his own kinsmen, of the whole world of creationand of virtue and subduer of foes. And banished by his oldand truthful sire's commands, that hero, along with his wifeand brother (Lakshmana) repaired to the forest. And whileroaming a-hunting in the forest he slew many a heroicRākshasa wearing shapes at will. And having heard of thedestruction of the Rākshasas of Janasthāna and of Khara and Dushana,the illusive Rāvana, assuming shapes at will, beguiling Rāma,in the forest, stole away his consort—the Janaka's daughter.And roaming the country around in quest of the blamelessand worshipful Sitā, Rāma found a firm friend in Sugriva.And bringing about the destruction of Vāli, Rāma, theconqueror of others' cities, conferred the monkey-kingdom uponthe high-souled Sugriva. And by Sugriva's decree, thousandsof monkeys, wearing shapes at will, have been searching thatworshipful dame in various directions. And by Sampati'scounsel and for that large eyed dame, I have leapt a hundredleagues across the deep. I have at last got her. And suchwere the form, grace and the marks that Rāghava mentionedunto me.\" Having said this, the foremost of the monkeysceased. And greatly wondered was Sitā hearing thosewords. Thereupon that timid dame, having good curlinghair, raising up her face covered with hairs, looked up tothe Singshapa tree. And hearing the words of the monkeyand casting her eyes to all directions and quarters, Sitāattained an excess of delight, being engaged in thoughtsconcerning Rāma.

Rāma, having truth for his prowess, never, for hislife, takes back what he gives, never speaks an untruth andalways speaks truth.

Thou art (thus) shaking my mind O gentleone, like unto water breaking down the banks of a river.Alas! this dream has afforded me immense pleasure since,I, who have been separated from my lord for so long a time,have beheld this monkey sent by Rāghava. I do not sink evenif I can behold in dream the heroic Rāghava along withLakshmana—but dream even is jealous of my well-being. Nordo I regard this as dream. To behold a monkey in a dreamdoth not lead to prosperity—whereas I have attained it.348 Oris it mental derangement? Or have I been possessed bya devil? Or have I run mad? Or is it the sultry vapourfloating over sands and appearing at a distance like water?No, it is not madness—for derangement of mind is the signof madness—I have not lost sense and I do distinctly perceiveme and the monkey.\" Thinking thus in many a way andascertaining the strength (of the monkey and the Rākshasa)Sitā took him for the lord of the Rākshasas, wearing shapesat will. And having arrived at this decision, Janaka'sdaughter—Sitā, ceased from talking with that monkey. Andapprised of Sitā's thought, Hanumān, the Wind god'sson, (replied) in words sweet unto her and enhancingher delight—\"Bright as the sun that lights the skyand dear as the moon to every eye, he pleases all his subjectswith bounties like unto those of Vaisrabana.349 He is giftedwith prowess like unto the greatly famed Vishnu, truthful andsweet-speeched like unto Vāchaspati.350 Graceful, grateful tothe eye and beautiful like unto Kandarva's351 self, he displayshis wrath in a proper quarter—the foremost of men and ofa mighty car. The whole world of creation (liveth safe) inthe shadow of the arms of that high-souled one. Thou shaltsoon see the consequences he shall reap by whom, assumingthe shape of a dear, Rāghava was taken away from thehermitage and thou wert stolen away from that lonely place.And soon shall that powerful (hero) destroy Rāvana in thebattle, with fiery arrows, discharged angrily.

Rāghava, with a due division ofhis time is engaged in acquiring piety, wealth emancipationand desires. He is truthful and graceful, amasses wealthand thereby protects his subjects. He is cognizant of thedivisions of time and country and dear unto all. Hisstepbrother Saumitri is gifted with incomparable prowess and ishis equal in attachment, beauty and accomplishments. Theperson of that graceful one is gold-hued whereas that of thehighly famous Rāma is green. And those two lions amongmen had no other delight but seeing thee. And theyransacking the whole world in quest of thee met us in theforest. And ranging the earth for thee they beheld Sugriva,of comely presence, the lord of monkeys, at the foot of themount Rishvamuka covered with trees, banished by his elderbrother and resorting there in his fear. And we were servingthat truthful Sugriva, the lord of monkeys, driven from thekingdom by his elder brother. And beholding those two bestof men, wearing bark and with bows in their hands, that bestof monkeys, stricken with fear, leaped above and stationedhimself on the crest of the hill. He then sent me to them.And thereupon by Sugriva's decree I, approached withjoined palms, those two foremost of men gifted with beautyand royal marks. And they were pleased by me, beinginformed of the real facts. And then placing those twobest of men on my back I arrived at the top of the hill andcommunicated the truth unto the high-souled Sugriva. Andconversing with each other those two lords of men andmonkeys attained great delight. And they consoled eachother narrating their respective misfortunes. And Rāmathen consoled Sugriva, driven away by his greatly powerfulelder brother Vāli on his wife's account. ThereuponLakshmana related unto Sugriva, the lord of monkeys, thegrief, of Rāma of unwearied actions, in consequence of thybeing borne away (by Rāvana). And hearing Lakshmana'swords, the lord of monkeys became pale, like unto the radiantSun possessed by Rāhu. And collecting all those ornamentswhich were thrown off by thee on the earth, when thou wertborne away, the leaders of the monkey hosts, delightedbrought them before Rāma. But they could not make out thywhereabouts. And all those ornaments, which were handedover to Rāma, were collected by me when they fell tinklingon the ground, Rāma being beside himself with grief. Andplacing them on his lap, the god-like Rāma bewailed invarious accents. And they inflamed the more Dacarathee's355grief. And being overwhelmed with grief that high-souledone laid himself low on the ground. And consoling him invarious words, I raised him up again. And looking againand again with Saumitri, at those costly ornaments, Rāghavahanded them over to Sugriva. Rāghava burns in grief, Oworshipful dame, in thy absence, like unto a volcanicmountain burning with a perpetual fire. For thee,sleeplessness, grief and anxiety are distressing Rāghava like untothree fires356 burning down the fire temple. Rāghava ismoved by thy separation like unto a huge mountain shakenby a terrible earth-quake. O daughter of a king, he isranging at large in many a beautiful forest, river andfountain—but he finds delight nowhere. O daughter of theking Janaka, bringing about the destruction of Rāvana, withall his kith and kin, Rāghava, the foremost of men, shallsoon regain thee. And thus Rāma and Sugriva entered intoa friendly covenant, to encompass Vāli's destruction and toinstitute enquiries about thee. And thereupon returning toKishkindhā with those two heroic princes, the lord of monkeyskilled Vāli in battle. And destroying Vāli by his prowessin battle, Rāma made Sugriva king over all monkeys andbears. And in this way, O dame, the alliance between Rāmaand Sugriva was made. And know me as Hanumān, theirmessenger who hath come to thee. Regaining his ownkingdom, Sugriva summoned all the mighty monkeys anddespatched them in various quarters in quest of thee. And thehighly powerful monkeys, resembling mountains, commandedby that lord of monkeys, proceeded to all the regions of theearth. And terrified by Sugriva's decrees, those monkeys,since then, have been ransacking the whole earth for thee.And I am one of them. And the beautiful and mighty son ofVāli, by name Angada, hath proceeded with three armies underhim. And many were the days and nights that we spent,overwhelmed with grief and having lost our way on that best ofmountains Vindhya. We gave up all our hopes for theaccomplishment of our end and our appointed time waswell-nigh spent. And in fear of that lord of monkeys weaddressed ourselves to put an end to our lives. Rangingthe mountain strongholds, rivers and fountains and notfinding thy reverence, we were ready to do away with ourexistence. And on the crest of that hill we took to fasting.And beholding those foremost of monkeys engaged in fastingAngada, sunk in grief, bewailed, O Vaidehi, mentioning thyrape, the destruction of Vāli in that way, our fastings andYatāyu's death. While we were thus waiting, ready for deathand giving up all hopes for the fulfillment of our master'sbehest, there appeared,as if the cause of our success, the mightyand powerful vulture,the brother of Yatāyu, by name Sampāti.And hearing of the destruction of his brother, he in wrath,said—'By whom and where hath my younger brother beenkilled? I wish to hear this from you, the foremost ofmonkeys.' And Angada related unto him verily Yatāyu'sdestruction at Janasthāna, for thee, by that grim-visagedRākshasa. And hearing of Yatāyu's death, Aruna's sonbecame afflicted with sorrow and informed us, O thouexquisitely fine damsel, of thy stay in the abode of Rāvana. Andhearing those words of Sampāti, enhancing our delight, weall, headed by Angada, left that place. And leaping fromthe crest of Vindhya mountain we reached the excellent brinkof the Ocean. Being greatly anxious to behold thee anddelighted, those plump monkeys headed by Angada, arrivedat the banks of the main. And worked up with a strongdesire to see thee, they again engaged in anxious thought.And beholding the ocean, the monkey hosts lost their heart.And removing their fear, I leaped a hundred leagues acrossthe deep and entered Lankā, at night, infested with demons.I have seen Rāvana, and thee stricken with grief. Othou of a blameless person, I have related all unto thee inregular order. Do thou speak to me, O worshipful dame,I am Dāçarathee's messenger. Do thou know me as theWind-god's son, the counsellor of Sugriva, who am engaged inRāma's service and have come here for thee. It is all wellwith thy Kākuthstha, the foremost of those using weapons,as well as with Lakshmana, O worshipful dame, gifted withauspicious marks, engaged in the worship of his superiorsand in the well being of thy lord. By Sugriva's decree,I alone have reached here. And I, ranging alone andwearing shapes at will, have come to this southern quarter, tofind out thy whereabouts. By my good luck I shall be able,with thy news, to remove the grief of those monkey hostswho are lamenting for thee. By my good fortune, mycrossing over the main, hath not become fruitless. I shall bepraised there, O worshiful dame, for I have been able to seethee. And the highly powerful Rāghava shall soon regainthee, destroying, with all his sons and friends, Rāvana theking of Rākshasas. There is a hill, O Vaidehi, namedMālyabāna, the foremost of all the mountains. There livesmy father, the great monkey Kesari. Being commanded bythe celestial ascetics, he once repaired thence to the mountGokarna and at the holy watering place of the lord of therivers he brought about the destruction of (the Asura)Samvasādana. O Vaidehi, I was born, on the field, of thatmonkey. And I am known all over the world as Hanumānby my own actions. To create thy confidence, O Vaidehi,I have related thy lord's accomplishments. And forsooth,thou shall soon be taken, O worshipful dame, by Rāghava.\"Having her confidence formed by these reasonings and variousmarks, Sitā, worn with grief, took him for Rāma'smessenger. And Jānaki attained an excess of delight and shedtears of joy from her eyes having curling eye-lashes.And the beautiful countenance of that large-eyed dame,having spacious eyes, appeared like the Moon released fromthe hold of Rāhu. She then took him for a real monkeyand none else. Thereupon Hanumān again spoke unto her,having a comely presence,—\"I have related unto thee allthis. Do thou be consoled, O Maithilee! Tell me now,what am I to do and what dost thou like. I shall soon repairhence. When the Asura Samvasādana was destroyed inconflict by that best of monkeys at the desire of the celestialascetics, I was born of the Wind, O Maithilee. I look like amonkey but am his equal in prowess.\""

 {
  "Āranya, Kishkindhā, and Sundara Kāndam": "The highly effulgent son of the Wind-god, Hanumān,to create Sitā's confidence, again addressed her with thefollowing words:—\"O great dame, I am a monkey, themessenger of the highly intelligent Rāma. Behold thisprecious ring with Rāma's name engraven on it, given bythy high-souled lord and brought as a token to create thyconfidence. Do thou take heart and may good betide thee,there will be an end of thy grief soon.\" And taking thering that used to deck her lord's finger and looking at it,Jānaki seemed to have actually got her lord. And hergraceful countenance, having large eyes, looked, withdelight, like unto the Moon released from the possessionof Rāhu. And greatly delighted at her husband's newsthat modest damsel, affectionately welcoming Hanumān,applauded that great monkey—\"O foremost of monkeys, thouart brave, powerful and wise, since thou hast alone smittenthis abode of the Rākshasas. Thou hast, with thy laudableprowess, leaped, a hundred leagues, across the ocean,the abode of marine monsters, taking it for Goshpada.357O foremost of monkeys, I do not consider thee as anordinary monkey, since thou dost not care or fear Rāvana. Obest of monkeys, thou art worthy of my welcome, sincethou hast been despatched by Rāma, knowing self. Rāma,hard of being got at, hath not sent thee, specially to me,without a trial of thy prowess. By my good luck, is it allwell with the virtuous-souled and truthful Rāma and thehighly powerful Lakshmana the enhancer of Sumitrā's joy?And if Kākuthstha lives untouched by ill, then why doeshe not burn the earth, encircled by the ocean, with his ire likeunto the fire of dissolution? Or they are capable of Hiscomfitting the celestials in a battle but me-thinks by myill-luck, the end of my miseries hath not arrived as yet.Is Rāma greatly pained? Does he grieve? Is that foremostof men making preparations for my rescue? Has he forgottenhis work being overwhelmed with fear and poorliness ofheart? Is that son of the king performing still his manlyduties? Is that slayer of foes, desirous of acquiring victory,pleasing his friends still with forgiveness and gifts anddealing his enemies with punishment, sowing dissensionsamongst them, and with other expedients? Is he still gainingfriends and are friends gathering around him? Is he welcominghis friends and are they honoring him the more? Is thatson of the king invoking the blessings of the celestials?Hath he attained manliness and assistance from the celestials?Hath Rāghava lost all his affection for me for my living ata distance from him? Will he save me from this disaster?Hath not Rāma, ever used to happiness and unused tomisery, been enfeebled by this disaster? Is he informedalways of the welfare of Kauslaya, Sumitrā and Bharata?Is not Rāghava, worthy of honors, beside himself with griefin my absence? Will not Rāma rescue met Will notBharata, ever devoted to his brother, send out one Aksauhiniof terrible soldiers under the command of his ministers formy rescue? Will not the graceful Sugriva, the lord of themonkeys come to help me with hosts of monkeys having hugeteeth and nails? Will not the heroic Lakshmana, theenhancer of Sumitrā's joy, conversant with the use ofweapons, burn down the Rākshasas with his shafts? Shall Inot behold soon that Rāvana with his kinsmen hath beendestroyed in battle by Rāma with terrible weapons? Is notthe gold-hued and lotus-smelling countenance (of Ramā)dried up in my absence like unto lotus dried up by the raysof the sun in shallow water? Does he still hold patiencein his heart, who renouncing his kingdom for virtue andrepairing, on foot with me even to the forest, was not stricken withfear and grief? His love for his mother, father or any otherperson is not greater than or equal to his love for me. Omessenger, I shall keep my life so long I do not hear anythingabout my dear one.\" Having addressed that lord of monkeyswith these highly sound and sweet accents, that gracefuland worshipful dame ceased, with a view to hear again fromhim pleasant tales regarding Rāma. And hearing the wordsof Sitā the terribly powerful Māruti, placing his joined palmson his head said,—\"The lotus-eyed Rāma doth not know thatthou art here, and hence he hath not been able to rescue theelike unto Purandara regaining Sachee. And hearing aboutthee from me soon shall Rāghava come assisted by a large armyof monkeys and bears. And impeding the course of theunagitated deep and building, by means of his terrible shafts, a bridgeacross it, Kākuthstha, shall divest the city Lankā of allthe Rākshasas. And forsooth shall Rāma destroy them, evenif the celestials, or Death himself stand in his way. Oworshipful dame, stricken with grief in thy absence, Rāmais restless like unto an elephant smitten by a lion. I canswear, O worshipful dame, by the mounts Mandāra, Malaya,Vindya, Sumeru, Dardura and all the fruits and roots, thatthou shalt behold like unto the rising of the full moon, thecountenance of Rāma having beautiful eyes, graceful,Bimba-like lips and beautified with beautiful kundalas.Thou shalt soon behold, O Vaidehi, Rāma, on themount Prasravana, like unto the performer of hundredsacrifices seated on the back of the elephant (Airavata).Rāghava doth not take meat nor drink honey—he takesevery day in the evening boiled rice and such wild fruitsas are sanctioned by the Sastras. His heart is so muchattached unto thee, that he does not drive away even flies,insects and snakes from his body. Rāma is always engagedin meditations, overwhelmed with grief, and he hasno other thought but seeing thee. Rāma hath no sleep andeven when asleep that best of men awakes exclaiming in sweetaccents, 'O Sitā!'. He always welcomes thee sighing andsaying \"O my dear love!\" whenever he beholds any fruit, floweror any object liked by the ladies. O worshipful dame, he isalways lamenting, exclaiming 'O Sitā!' and that high-souledson of the king, to regain thee, hath resorted to asceticobservances.\" On hearing about Rlma, Sitā was greatlydelighted and she was equally grieved on hearing of hissorrow. And it appeared like the rising of the moon andthe appearance of the clouds at the same time in an autumnalnight."

 {
  "Āranya, Kishkindhā, and Sundara Kāndam": "Hearing those words, Sitā having a moon-likecountenance, again spoke unto Hanumān, words, sound and pious:—\"O monkey, what thou hast said that Rāma is not attachedunto any other thing and is worn with grief, is like nectar mixedwith poison. Whether in the enjoyment of vast riches, oremerged in the abyss of miseries, Death is pulling a man,binding him roughly with a chord. O best of monkeys, peoplecannot thwart the course of destiny. Behold me, Rāma andSaumitri, therefore sunk in miseries. I do not know whenshall Rāghava get at the other end of the ocean of grief,by displaying his prowess, like unto one, swimming acrossthe ocean when the boat is sunk. I do not know when shallmy lord see me, destroying the Rākshasas, killing Rāvanaand devastating the city of Lankā. Do thou tell him tocome before this year expires for till then I shall live.This is the tenth month and two months still remain,O monkey and that is the time appointed by thecruel Rāvana. He was entreated very much by hisbrother Bivishana to restore me but he paid no need tohis requests. Rāvana doth not desire to restore me (untoRāma) for he has been brought under the influence ofDeath who is seeking him in battle. Bivishana's eldestdaughter, monkey, by name Kalā, hath related this untome, being appointed by her mother. There is a leading,steady, old, intelligent and educated Rākshasa, gifted with agood character, named Abindhya and highly respected ofRāvana who told him that the destruction of the Rākshasa racewould proceed from Rāma, but the vicious-souled one paidno attention to his well-meaning words. I hope, O foremostof monkeys, that my husband shall soon regain me for pureis my soul and he is gifted with many accomplishments.Rāghava hath in him, O monkey, energy, manliness, strength,kindness, gratitude and prowess. He brought about withouthis brother's aid, the destruction of the fourteen thousandRākshasas at Janasthāna. What enemy is not troubled atthis? The disaster-creating Rākshasas can never becompared with that best of men. I am cognizant of his prowessas Sachee is of Indra's. O monkey, Rāma the Sun, withhis arrow-like rays, shall dry up the water—the inimicalRākshasas.\" Saying this she was overwhelmed with griefon Rāma's account, and Hanumān again spoke unto herhaving her countenance bathed in tears,—\"No sooner shallRāghava hear from me than he shall speedily repair hitherfollowed by a huge army of monkeys and bears. Or I shallrelease thee even to-day from the grasp of that Rākshasaand these miseries. Do thou place thyself on my back, O thouof a blameless person. And having thee on my back I shallleap over the main. I am capable of carrying thecity of Lankā even with Rāvana. I shall restore thee to-day,O Maithili, unto Rāghava on the mount Prasravana, like untofire carrying unto Indra, the sacrificial offerings. Thou shaltbehold to-day, O Vaidehi, Rāma along with Lakshmana,making preparations (for the destruction of his enemy) likeunto Vishnu, engaged in the destruction of demons. (Andthou shalt observe) that highly powerful one, anxious tobehold thee and seated like unto Purandara on the summitof that foremost of mountains. Do thou place thyself onmy back, O worshipful dame, do thou not neglect it, Obeautiful lady, and be thus reconciled unto Rāma like unto Rohinirestored to the Moon. By the time, that we will take intalking thus, thou shalt reach Rāma like Rohini restored tothe Moon. Do thou therefore place thyself on my back andI shall cross the ocean sailing by the aetherial way. O fairone, carrying thee from this place, none amongst theinhabitants of Lankā shall be able to follow me. In the same wayI have come here I shall return by the welkin, O Vaidehiplacing thee on my back.\" Hearing those surprising wordsfrom that best of monkeys, Maithilee, having her entire frameworked up with joy, again bespake Hanumin—\"Hanumān,how darest thou take me to such a long distance? O lordof monkey hosts, this attests to thy monkey hood. Oforemost of monkeys, little-bodied as thou art, how dost thoudesire, to take me hence to my husband the lord of men?\"Hearing the words of Sitā, the graceful son of the Wind-godHanumān reflected aside—\"This is my first insult. Thelotus-eyed dame is not cognizant of my prowess or strength.Vaidehi should therefore learn that I can assume shapes atwill.\" Thinking thus, Hanumān, the foremost of the monkeysand the slayer of foes, showed himself unto Sitā, in his trueshape. And leaping down from the tree, that best ofmonkeys began to increase himself to create Sitā's confidence.His person appeared like the hill Mandāra and the flamingfire. And that best of monkeys having a copper-coloredcountenance, thunder-like nails and teeth and mountain-likehuge body, appeared before Sitā and said—\"I am capableof carrying this Lankā with her lord, the mountains, forestsgardens, buildings, walls and gate-ways. Do thou thereforeconfide in me, O worshipful dame, and be not suspicious.And O Vaidehi, do thou remove Rāma's grief as well asLakshmana's.\" Beholding the Wind-god's own begottenson, Hanumān, resembling a huge mountain, Sitā, the daughterof Janaka, having eyes resembling lotus-petals, said,—\"Ogreat monkey, I know thy strength and bravery, thy air-likemotion and thy wonderful fire-like energy. What ordinaryman can come here crossing the incomparable ocean. Olord of monkey hosts, I understand that thou art capableof returning and thou shalt be able to carry me. But Ishould consider now how the work might be accomplished.O foremost of monkeys, I should not go with thee. PerhapsI might lose my sense with thy air-like velocity. Whenmoving terribly thou shalt proceed high up in the welkin,perhaps I shall then fall down. No sooner I shall fall downinto the ocean infested with fish and other animals than Ishall be an excellent food unto them. O slayer of foes, Ishall not be able to accompany thee. For seeing thee carrya woman; they shall surely suspect thee. And finding mestolen, those terribly powerful Rākshasas commanded by thevicious-souled Rāvana, shall follow thee. O hero, carryingme and encircled by those heroic Rākshasas with maces anddarts in their hands, thou shalt be beset with dangers.And on the sky the Rākshasas shall be armed withweapons and thou shalt be without any. How shaltthou be able to fight and protect me at the same time.And when thou shalt be engaged in conflict with thoseRākshasas of terrible deeds, I, O foremost of monkeys,stricken with fear, shall fall down from thy back. Oforemost of monkeys those terrible and powerful Rākshasasshall be able to defeat thee a little. And when thou shaltbe defeated in battle I shall fall down and thosevicious Rākshasas shall carry me away from thyhands or destroy me. Victory or defeat is uncertain in abattle. I shall thus be distressed by those Rākshasas settingup terrible roars and thy endeavours shall be fruitless, O bestof monkeys. Thou art capable of destroying the Rākshasasvery easily (I admit)—but Rāma's fame shall then be soiledif dost thou bring about their destruction. Or the Rākshasastaking me away shall keep me in such a secret place, thatneither the monkeys nor Rāghava shall be able to ascertainmy whereabouts. And all thy preparations for me shall thusbe useless. And mighty shall be the result of Rāma's comingwith thee. O large armed one, the life of Rāghava ofunmitigated prowess, those of his brothers and of thy royal raceare all subject to me. And when they shall give up theirhopes of releasing me, they, worn out with grief and anxietyshall renounce their lives along with the monkeys and bears.O monkey, being guided by my love for my husband, I do notlike willingly to touch any body's person but Rāma's. WhenRāvana, by force touched my person, I had no other help, forI was then without my lord and therefore was subject toanother person. If Rāma can take me away from here,destroying the Ten-necked one with all the Rākshasas—he shallthen perform the worthy action. I have heard of and myselfseen the prowess of the highly-souled (Rāma) unconquerablein a battle. There is none amongst the celestials, Gandharbas,Nāgas and the Rākshasas who can match him in a conflictBeholding that highly powerful Rāghava, in a conflict, likeunto Vāsava in prowess, holding a wonderful bow andfollowed by Lakshmana, who can withstand his prowessresembling the flaming fire? O foremost of monkeys, whocan withstand Rāghava in a conflict, followed byLakshmana moving like an infuriated elephant and showeringshafts like unto the rays of the sun at the time ofDissolution? O best of monkeys do thou speedily bring here mydear one along with Lakshmana and the lord of monkey hosts.O heroic monkey, do thou soon satisfy me, who am strickenwith grief in consequence of my long separation from Rāma."

  "Āranya, Kishkindhā, and Sundara Kāndam": "Hearing those words, that foremost of monkeys, skilledin speech, was greatly delighted and again addressedSitā in the following words,—\"O worshipful lady, O thouof an auspicious presence, what thou hast said, speaks wellfor a feminine nature and the modesty of a chaste damsel.And because thou art a female, thou art not capable ofcrossing on my back, the main extending over a thousandleagues. The second argument—I shall not touch anyother person's body than Rāma's, which thou hast produced,O Jānaki! O thou gifted with modesty! truly becometh thee,who art the spouse of that high-souled one. Who else thanthee, O worshipful one, can give expression to such words?Truly shall Kākutstha hear from the beginning to the end,O worshipful dame, of thy actions before me, and all thouhast said. For many reasons, I gave vent to such words,O lady,—I am anxious to compass Rāma's end, and myheart is melted with affection. It is very difficult to enterthis city of Lankā, it is equally hard to cross over the main—but I am capable of doing all these, and hence I gaveutterance to all those words. I wish to take thee eventoday to the descendant of Raghu. It is for my devotionunto him and regard for thee that I said so and for nothingelse. If thou dost not wish to go with me, O thou of ablameless person, do thou give me such a token as might createRāghava's confidence.\" Being thus accosted by Hanumān,Sitā resembling the daughter of a celestial, spoke, gently, wordswith their letters strung on the vapour of grief,—\"Do thoumention unto my dear lord (in my words) what had happenedunto me while living in the hermitage at the foot of the mountPratyanga, situate on the north-east of Chitrakuta, aboundingin roots, fruits and water. 'At no distance from that placefrequented by the ascetics flowed the sacred stream Mandākini.While ranging in that woodland fragrant with the odour ofmany flowers, thou, having thy person wet in consequenceof thy sport in the water, didst sit on my lap. A crow, atthat time, longing to feed on my flesh, tore my breast Withits beak. And I threatened it with a pebble. But itcontinued tearing my breast as if it sat there to feed on myflesh and therefore did not fly off. Being enraged with thatbird, as I tried to tighten the cloth around my waist, it gaveway a little, and thou, rising up from thy seat and looking atme, didst laugh over it. And I was greatly enraged withthy laughter and ashamed, and, being wounded by the crow,I approached thee. Thereupon, tired as I was, I sat on thylap, and, exercised with ire, I was consoled by thee laughing.Now I, having my countenance bathed in tears, gentlyrubbed my eyes. And I was seen by thee, O my lord, in thatwise, greatly enraged with the crow. O Rāghava, I sleptfor sometime, at thy lap, out of exhaustion, and thyselfin turn, slept at mine, O elder brother of Bharata. Inthe meantime, that crow again suddenly approaching,tore my breast with its beak, as I awoke and wasrising up from thy lap, O Rāghava. Thereupon Rāghavaawoke with the shedding of blood. Beholding my breastwounded, that larged-armed hero wroth like a serpent,sighing, said,—O thou having thighs like the trunk of anelephant, by whom hath thy breast been wounded? Whowants to play with an angry five-hooded serpent?—Thereupon,casting his looks around, he espied the crow, sitting in myfront with its claws besmeared with blood. That crow,best of birds, was the son of the lord of the celestialsin disguise. And gifted with air-like velocity, he speedilyentered inside the earth. Thereupon that large-eyedhero, best of the intelligent, with his eyes whirling withire, resolved to destroy that crow. And taking a blade of Kuçaoff his seat, he tied it to a Brahma weapon. And thatblade, facing the bird, appeared with its flaming face, likethe fire that would destroy the world. And he hurled thatburning blade at the crow. And it pursued the crow highup in the welkin. Being thus pursued, that crow, in orderto save himself, traversed various regions. And beingthen renounced by his father (Indra) and the great ascetics,he, ranging the three worlds, at last resorted to his (Rāma's)shelter. And, placing himself on the earth, he sought hisshelter, and Kākutstha, out of mercy, saved him, albeitworthy of being killed. And he spoke unto him, greatlyfamished, of a pale countenance and lying on the earth,—It isimpossible to render this Brahma weapon fruitless.Therefore, do thou speak (as to what is to be done.)—He thendestroyed the right eye of the crow. Having given up hiseye, he saved himself. Then bowing unto Rāma as wellas king Daçaratha, the crow, liberated by that hero, wentto his own abode. 'Thou hadst on my behalf dischargedthe Brahma weapon even at a crow. Why then, O lordof earth, dost thou forbear him who had carried me off fromthee? O foremost of men, do thou dispense unto me thykindness capable of inspiring hope. O lord, possessing alord in thee, I (now) appear as if I had none. Thatkindness is a prime virtue—I have heard even from thee; and Iknow that thou art exceedingly energetic and possessed ofgreat strength and high courage,—unfettered byconsiderations of time and space, incapable of being agitated, thou ingravity resemblest the ocean, and like unto that lord of theearth furnished with seas—Vāsava. O Rāghava, being thusthe foremost of those acquainted with weapons, powerful,and possessed of strength, wherefore dost thou not directthy weapon against the Rākshasas?' Neither Nāgas, norGandharbas, nor the gods, nor the Maruts, are competent toresist the onset of Rāma in battle. If that puissant one stillretains any regard for me, why doth he not by means ofsharpened shafts make root and branch work with the Rākshasas?And why, taking the permission of his brother, that repressorof foes, the heroic Lakshmana gifted with great strength, dothnot deliver me? If those foremost of men be indeed equalto Indra and the Wind, and incapable of being repressedeven by the celestials, wherefore do they disregard me?Surely I must be guilty of some great crime, since althoughcapable, those subduers of enemies do not look at me.'Hearing Vaidehi's piteous words uttered with tearful eyes,that leader of monkey-bands, the exceedingly energeticHanumān, said,—\"O exalted one, I swear by truth, Rāmaturneth away his countenance (from every work) inconsequence of grief for thee. And Rāma being seized withsorrow, Lakshmana burns in grief. Now that I have beenable to obtain a sight of thee, this is no season for sorrow.O auspicious one, even now thou shalt witness the end ofthis woe. Filled with hope from my sight of thee, thoseforemost of persons, those mighty princes, shall reduce theworlds to ashes. And, O thou of expansive eyes, slayingin battle the wicked Rāvana with his allies, Rāghava shalltake thee back to his palace. Now tell me what I shallcommunicate unto Rāghava, and the highly powerfulLakshmana, and the energetic Sugriva, and all the assembledmonkeys.\" Thus addressed, Sitā again spoke unto him,saying,—Do thou on my behalf, bowing down the head, enquireafter the welfare of that protector of men whom Kaucalyā hathbrought forth. Do thou on my behalf, and on account ofmy words, enquire after the welfare of him, who, renouncingwreaths and gems of all kinds, and beloved damsels possessedof transcendent beauty, and wealth such as is difficult toobtain on this spacious earth; and who, honoring and bowingunto his father and mother, followed Rāma,—in whomSumitra hath an excellent son,—of that righteous one, who,espousing the cause of his brother, renouncing choicehappiness, followeth his brother to the forest, ministeringunto him; who is lion-shouldered, long-armed, intelligent,and of a prepossessing presence; who beareth himselftowards Rāma as if he were his sire, and towards me, as if Iwere his mother; of that heroic Lakshmana who did notknow when I was ravished away;—the servant of the elders,crowned with auspiciousness,—who is competent and reinethin his tongue; who is the foremost of those dear unto theking's son,358 and worthy of my father-in-law; who is dearer[unto Rāma) than even my own self; of Lakshmana, brotherinto Rāma; that energetic one who undertaketh even suchtasks as he is not equal to, and seeing whom Rāghava hathforgotten his deceased sire359,—him for the sake of my words,thou must ask as to his welfare. Lakshmana is always mildand pure, and dear unto Rāma. Do thou speak to him so,that, O best of monkeys, he may remove my miseries. Oleader of monkey-bands, do thou bring about success on thisundertaking. From this preliminary endeavour of thine,Rāghava shall take pains on my behalf.—This also shalt thousay again and again unto that hero—my lord,—'O son ofDaçaratha, I shall keep on this life for another month; andthis I swear unto thee by truth that I will not live beyondthis month. O hero, even as Vishnu rescued Kauçiki fromthe nether regions,360 it behoveth thee to rescue me, who haveignominiously been confined by the impious Rāvana.\"—Thereupon, saying,—\"Hand this unto Rāghava,\" Sitā gaveto Hanumān a noble and excellent jewel for the head361,which was tied up in her attire. Then taking thatbest of gems, the hero tried to fix it on his finger; butit did not enter into it.362 And taking the gem, and bowingunto Sitā and going round her, that foremost of monkeysremained by her side in humble guise. And experiencingrapture in consequence of his seeing Sitā, he mentallypresented himself before Rāma, and Lakshmana graced withauspicious marks. And taking that costly and superb gem,which by virtue of some power, king Janaka's daughter hadmanaged to hide (from the gaze of the Rāshasis), Hanumlān,feeling delighted like one, shaken by the wind blowing onthe top of the foremost of mountains, and then getting awayfrom it, prepared to set out."

  "Āranya, Kishkindhā, and Sundara Kāndam": "Having made over the gem, Sitā said onto Hanumān,—\"This sign is very well known to Rāma. Seeing this gem,that hero, Rāma, shall recollect three persons,—his mother,myself, and king Daçaratha, Thou, O foremost of monkeys,wilt again be commissioned on this business. Do thoubethink thee as to what thou wilt do afterwards, when thouhast been entrusted with this task. O foremost of monkeys,thou art capable of compassing this work. Therefore, thinkas to what course of his (Rāma's) shall remove (my) misery.O Hanumān, undergoing toils, be thou instrumental inremoving my misery.\" Saying, \"So be it,\" the Wind-god'soffspring of terrible prowess, bowing down the head,prepared to depart. Seeing that (Hanumān) was about to set out,that exalted one, Mithilā's daughter, addressed that monkey,son unto the Wind-god, in words choked by the vapour ofgrief,—\"O Hanumān, do thou communicate good news toboth Rāma and Lakshmana, to Sugriva with his counsellors,and to all the aged monkeys. And, O best of monkeys, inconsonance with righteousness, communicate good tidings(unto Rāma). And it behoveth thee to strive so that themighty-armed Rāghava may rescue me from this sea ofsorrow. And, O Hanumān, do thou speak so that theillustrious Rāma may deliver me while I am still alive; andthereby do thou reap righteousness. Ever breathing highspirits, Dācarathi,363 hearing my words, shall attain an accessof manliness for my deliverance. Soon as Rāghava shall hearwords couching tidings of me, that hero shall duly resolveon displaying his prowess.\" Hearing this speech of Sitā,Hanumān, son unto the Wind-god, with his joined handsraised to his head, said,—\"Soon shall Kākutstha come,surrounded by the foremost monkeys and bears; and,vanquishing the foe in fight, shall remove thy grief. Find Inone either among men, or Asuras, or celestials, that daresremain before him as he discharges his shafts. For thee, inespecial, he can stand in conflict even the Sun, Indra,nay—Yama himself, that offspring of the Sun. For thee, heprepareth himself to conquer the Earth bounded by themain; and victory, thou daughter of Janaka, shall be Rāma's.\"Hearing his words excellently spoken and thoroughly true,Jānaki honored them highly, and spoke (as follows). Andgazing at him once and again as he prepared to go away,Sitā from affection honored the speech which had beenuttered (by Hanuroan) out of attachment unto his master,—\"If thou wish it, O hero, do thou, O subduer of enemies, stayhere for one day. Having rested in some hidden nook, thouwilt depart to-morrow. O monkey, (if thou dost remain),thy vicinity shall for a moment remove the huge grief ofme of slender luck. But even if thou go (passing to-dayhere), I have, O tiger-like monkey, doubts as to thy return;and, accordingly, doubt, certainly, as to my life. And thegrief incident to my not seeing thee shall burn me greatly,even, O monkey, as grief burneth one that is alreadyconsumed by sorrow over and over again. And, O hero,O lord of monkeys, this doubt is also before me. How,alas! shall the mighty lord of monkeys, albeit backedby the monkeys and bears, cross over the mighty main hardto cross,—and (how shall) those forces consisting of bears andmonkeys or those sons of the best of men (cross over thesame)? In all the three worlds, Vinatā's offspring, thyself,and the Wind-god, have alone the power of crossing over thedeep.—Then, for the accomplishment of this work, difficult tocompass, what, O hero, O thou best of those conversant withbusiness, what way dost thou see as to its success? Or thoualone, O destroyer of hostile heroes, art quite enough for thefulfilment of this purpose; and thou shalt reap, in the shapeof fame, the fruit of thy achievement. But if (Rāma) himselftogether with all his forces, conquering Rāvana and(recovering me) in battle, returned victorious to his own city,—thiswould be worthy of himself. If blocking up Lankā with hisarmy, that afflictor of hostile hosts, Kākutstha took me(hence), that would be worthy of him. Do thou, therefore,adopt such means that the high-souled heroic warrior mayhave an opportunity of putting forth prowess. Hearingthose words fraught with sense and reason and informed withaffection, Hanumān, by way of reply said mildly,—\"O reveredlady, that foremost of monkeys—the lord of bears andmonkeys—Sugriva, possessed of truth, hath made up his mind onthy behalf. That destroyer of Rākshasas, O daughter ofVideha, environed by thousands of millions of monkeys,will come hither without delay. And exceedingly powerfuland mighty monkeys possessed of prowess, and speeding farwith the rapidity of thought, are in his command. Nothingcan impede their courses, either upward, or downward, ortending in both directions; and those ones of measurelessenergy never experience depression in the most arduousundertakings. Braced by their exalted spirits, these,resorting to the aerial way, have many a time and oftcircumambulated the Earth containing mountains and meads. Thereare (in that army) rangers of woods, some equal and somesuperior to me. And near Sugriva there are none who areinferior to me. And since even I have reached this place, whatshall I say of those ones endowed with immense might? Norare superior (monkeys) sent on errands; it is only theinferior ones that are sent. Then, O exalted one, thou needstnot grieve: let thy sorrow depart. Those leaders ofmonkey-herds will come to Lankā by one bound; and, like untothe risen Sun and Moon, those leonine men, having largenumbers to back them, will come to thy side, riding my back.Those heroes and foremost of men, Rāma and Lakshmanaboth, coming to the city of Lankā, shall destroy her by meansof their shafts. And slaying Rāvana together with hisadherents, Raghu's son, taking thee, O paragon amongwomen, shall return to his own city. Therefore, do thou takeheart, good betide thee! Do thou remain, eagerly wishingfor the time. It will not be long before thou shalt beholdRāma resembling flaming fire. On the lord of Rākshasasbeing slain along with his counsellors and friends, thoushalt meet with Rāma, even as Rohini meeteth with theMoon. O worshipful one, speedily shalt thou behold theother shore of thy misery, O Maithili; and thou shalt seeRāvana slain by Rāma by might of arm.\" Having thussolaced Videha's daughter, Hanumān, son unto the Wind-god,again spoke unto Vaidehi, saying,—\"Soon shalt thou beholdthat destroyer of foes, Rāghava of subdued soul, and thebow-bearing Lakshmana also, come to the gate of Lankā.And soon shalt thou behold the assembled heroic monkeys,endowed with the prowess of lions and tigers, and thesplendour of the monarch of monkeys, and having nails and teethfor their arms. And thou shalt, O noble one, beholdinnumerable companies of choice monkeys, resembling hills andclouds,—roaring on the plateaus of Malaya in Lankā."

In my misfortune, O sinless one, I used to inspirecheerfulness by a sight of this, resembling thyself. Thisgraceful water-sprung (gem) I part from. Hereafter,overwhelmed with grief, I shall not be able to live. For theeonly do I bear insufferable miseries, heart-cleaving speech,and companionship with Rākshasas.

Beheld have I this dark-eyed lady.Passing by three means, I see that I shall have to resortto the fourth. No treaty with Rakshas can answer the end.Neither can gifts prevail with the wealthy. Nor is it possibleto sow dissensions among persons proud of their strength.Then, display of prowess appeareth to me applicable in thiscase. Without resorting to prowess, way find I none forensuring success in this matter. If the Rakshas find theirforemost heroes fallen in battle, they may temper their(martial ardour). He that, having compassed his (principal)purpose, accomplishes many more without marring theprime one, is entitled to act He that doeth a small workis certainly not a worker,—he it is that knoweth to bringabout success in diverse ways, is alone capable of securingthe same.366 Although my sole commission was to effectthis much,367 yet if I repair to the abode of the lord ofmonkeys after having ascertained the strength of ourownselves and that of the foe in the field, then I shall havedone the mandate of my master. How can my arrival (atthis place) be made to bring forth good fruit? How can Iforcibly bring on engagement with the Rākshasas? Andhow can the Ten-necked one in battle be made to form a justestimate of the respective strength of myself and hisforces? Coming in contact with the Ten-necked one,with his three orders, forces and charioteers, I shall, readingthe intention that is in his heart, as well as his strength,—happily return from hence.

And with its trees crushed and its tanksdamaged, with its fair peaks shattered in fragments and its poolseloquent with the notes of birds, riven all over, with copperyand withered sprays cast about (in all directions), and withits trees and plants shorn of their liveliness,—that wood wasno longer beautiful,—as if it had been burnt up by aforest-fire; and its plants resembled damsels with their apparelfalling off. And that magnificent wood, with its arbours andits picture-gallerys destroyed, and its ferocious animals,beasts and birds crying in distressful accents,—and its rockystructures and other mansions broken down, was bereft ofits loveliness. And that grove of the inner apartmentbelonging to the damsels368 of the Ten-necked one, with its numbersof açoka trees and plants cast about disorderly, was, in verysooth, through the might of the monkey, rendered a sightcomposed of plants, etc., tending to awaken the regret of thespectator.369 Then having done what was wondrousdisagreeable unto the mind of the magnanimous lord of the world,that monkey desirous of coping alone with a vast host, stoodby the main entrance, flaming in effulgence."

And grim-visaged Rākshasis, awaking from theirsleep, saw that wood devastated, and that heroic mightymonkey. And observing them, that mighty-armed andpowerful monkey endowed with immense strength, magnifiedhis dimensions, capable of striking terror into theRakshasas. And beholding that exceedingly strong monkeyresembling a mountain, the Rākshasis asked Janaka's daughter,saying,—\"Who is this? And whence, and wherefore, hathhe come here? And why did he carry on converse withthee? Tell us this, thou of expansive eyes. O luckyone, entertain no fear. And, O thou having eyes withdark outer corners, what is the talk that this one hath heldwith thee?\" Thereat, the chaste Sitā, having all her partsperfect, answered,—\"What is my power to read Rākshasascapable of wearing forms at will?

Nor, albeit questioned by us manya time and oft, doth Janaka's daughter, Sitā, having the eyesof a deer, intend to tell us who the monkey is. He may bethe emissary of Vasava, or of Vaipravana; or he may havebeen sent by Rāma himself from eagerness to get at thewhereabouts of Sitā.

But what is his fatigue? She it is thathath been preserved by him. And that overgrown Sinçapātree, affluent with elegant foliage, under which Sitā herselfhath (always rested), hath been spared by him. It behoveththee to order sharp chastisement to be inflicted on that oneof a fierce form, who, having carried on converse with Sitā,hath laid thy wood waste.

And as fall drops of lighted oil from a flaminglamp,fell drops of tears from the eyes of the enraged Rāvana.And that highly energetic one ordered his heroic servants,resembling himself, to punish Hanumān. And from thatmansion speedily issued eighty thousand of those retainers,carrying in their hands maces and mallets370,—having hugebellies, and large teeth, of dreadful forms, and possessed ofunwieldy strength,—all eager to engage in the conflict andtake Hanumān. And having come near that monkey stayingat the main entrance, those swelling spirits rushed on, evenas insects rush into a flame. And equipped with variegatedmaces, and bludgeons, and golden angadas,371 and arrowsresembling the Sun, they approached that foremost of monkeys.And accoutred in maces, axes, and javelins, and bearingbearded darts and lances in their hands, they suddeuly surroundedHanumān and remained before him. And the graceful andenergetic Hanumān also, resembling a hill, flourishing histail over the ground, sent up tremendous roars. Andattaining mighty proportions, Hanumān, son unto the Wind-god,brandished his tail, filling Lankā with sounds. And at thesounds of his flourishing, as well as with those resoundingones set up by himself, birds began to drop down from thesky. And he loudly proclaimed,—\"Victory to the exceedinglystrong Rāma and to the mighty Lakshmana! And victoryunto king Sugriva, protected of Rāghava!

In the very presence of all the Rakshas, shallI, having desolated the city of Lankā and paid myreverence to Maithili, go away, my end being compassed.\"They were struck with affright at his roars; and they beheldHanumān elevated as an evening cloud. And now knowingfor certain that the monkey had been despatched by hismaster, the Rākshasas commenced assailing him with variouskinds of dire arms.372 Environed on all sides by thoseheroes, that exceedingly powerful one, staying by the mainentrance, took up a terrific bolt. And taking that bolt, likeVinatā's offspring handling a darting serpent, he slew thoserangers of the night. And grasping (the bolt), theWind-god's son began to range the welkin and destroy (theRākshasas), like the thousand-eyed (deity) slaughtering Daityaswith his thunder-bolt. And having slain those Rākshasas,who were the retainers of Rāvana, the heroic offspring ofthe Wind-god—foremost of heroes—desirous of fight, stoodat the gate. Then certain Rākshasas, getting off from thefield in fear, informed Rāvana of the destruction of all hisservants.

Witnessing his action rendered fruitless, theenergetic Hanumān of terrific prowess, uprooting a large sāla,began to whirl it (in the air). Seeing the exceedingly strongmonkey whirling the sāla tree, the highly powerful Jamvumālidischanged a many shafts. And he severed the sāla bymeans of four shafts, and wounded the monkey in the armwith five, in the chest, with one, and with ten, between theteats. With his body covered all over with shafts, (Hanumān)getting into a furious passion, taking up the same bolt, againbegan to swing it with rapidity.

And on the mighty son of Prahastahaving been slain, the lord of the night-rangers, with hisreddened eyes rolling in rage, speedily commanded thesons of his counsellors, endowed with vast energy andprowess, (to encounter Hanumān in battle.)"

And surrounded by a mightyarmy, furnished with bows, endowed with wondrous strength,and accomplished in arms—the foremost of those acquaintedwith weapons—each burning for victory, with mighty carsyoked with steeds, covered with golden net-works, bearingpennons and standards,and having sounds like thoseproceeding from clouds,—exultingly stretching with immeasurableprowess bows decked with gold,—resembling clouds surchargedwith lightning,—those warriors sallied out. Learning that theservants had been slain, their379 mothers, along with theirfriends and kindred, were overpowered with grief. Andvieing with each other in eagerness, those (warriors) deckedin ornaments of polished gold, confronted Hanumān stayingat the gate. And with their cars sending roars, the Rākshasas,pouring showers of shafts, ranged (the field), resemblingclouds during the rainy season. And covered with thosearrowy showers, Hanumān had his person concealed, like themonarch of mountains hidden by a downpour. And thatswift-speeding monkey, coursing the cloudless sky, evadedthose shafts of those heroes, as well as the impetuosity oftheir cars. And that hero, playing pranks with thosebowmen, appeared like the masterful Wind playing tricks withthe bow-bearing clouds.380 And sending up a dreadful shout,and thereby filling that vast host with fright, the energeticHanumān rushed on that Rākshasa army. And that subduerof enemies slew some with slaps, and some he rived withnails, and some he killed by blows, and others with (thepressure of) his chest. And some dropped down on theground at the very same spot at the sounds that he emitted.And on their being slain or falling on the earth, that army,afflicted with affright, began to fly in all directions. And theelephants roared in frightful tones, and the steeds fell downoa the earth.—And the Earth was covered with broken boxes,flagstaffs, and umbrellas, (belonging to the cars), as also withthe cars themselves.—And rivers running gore were seen onthe way, and Lankā uttered various frightful cries. And havingslain those overgrown Rākshasas, that exceedingly powerfuland heroic monkey of terrific power, desirous of again copingwith other Rākshasas, retraced his steps to the self-sameentrance."

And he directed five of the foremostleaders of his forces, the heroic Virupāksha, Yupaksha, theRākshasa Durdharsha, Praghasa, and Māsakarna, versed inpolity, endowed with the speed of the Wind in conflict andalert on every occasion, to take Hanumān captive.\"Ye generals,do ye taking a mighty host with steeds, elephants and cars,chastise that monkey. And coming to that dweller of thewoods, ye had better act heedfully, and should accomplishthis work in consonance with place and season. Havingregard to his acts, I do not take him to be a monkey. Heis a great being endowed with extraordinary prowess everyway. My mind is not satisfied that he is a monkey. Hemay have been brought into being by Indra, through asceticmight, for injuring us. Backed by you, I have defeated(deities), and Nāgas, and Yakshas, and Gandharbas, andAsuras, and Maharshis. And, for certain, they have hereintried to do us some wrong. Therefore there is no doubtabout this,—do ye by main force take him. And, ye generals,go ye, taking a mighty force with steeds, elephants andcars. Do ye chastise this monkey. This monkey ofdeliberate prowess should not be disregarded by you. I haveseen381 monkeys of immense prowess,—Vāli with Sugrivaand the exceedingly powerful Jāmbavān, and Nila thegeneral, and others with Dwivida at their head. Their speedis not dreadful, nor their energy, nor their prowess, northeir intelligence, nor their strength, nor their courage, northeir capacity to change shapes. Therefore ye should knowhim as some great being staying in the form of a monkey.Exerting yourself to the uttermost, do ye chastise him.These three worlds combined, with Indra, celestials andmortals, are incapable of long staying before you in the fieldof battle. Still a person versed in polity, albeit anxious tosecure victory in battle, should carefully preserve self, assuccess in war is unstable.\" Thereupon, they, possessed ofthe energy of fire, accepting the words of their master,rushedforth vehemently, accompanied with cars, mad elephants,fleet steeds, sharp and whetted weapons,—and forces of allkinds. Then those heroes saw that effulgent mighty monkey,shining in his native splendour, like unto the risen sun,—possessed of great strength and immense speed, andmagnanimity of mind,—seated at the gate. And soon as they sawhim, they, frightened at his appearance, assailed him withtheir respective terrible weapons. And Durdhasa dischargedat Hanumān's head five white iron382 arrows with yellowheads, and possessing the lustre of lotus-leaves. Havingbeen pierced in the head with those shafts, the monkey,roaring, leapt into the sky, making the ten cardinal pointsresound. Then the exceedingly powerful and heroic Durdhara,mounted on a car, with his bow stringed, came forward,showering innumerable arrows by hundreds. Thereat, evenas the wind driveth away rain-pouring clouds at the end ofthe rainy season, the monkey, remaining in the sky, resisted(his antagonist) as he kept on pouring his shafts. And sorebeset by Durdhara, the Wind-god's son again emitted cries,and that puissant one also increased himself. Then dartingfar up in the air, the monkey suddenly descended on thecar of Durdhara with extreme vehemence, like unto amass of lightning alighting on a mountain.—Thereat hiseight steeds getting mangled, and the wheels and pole ofhis car having been broken, Durdhara leaving the car, felldown to the earth, deprived of life. Seeing him down on theearth, those irrepressible subduers of enemies, Virupākshaand Yupāksha, waxing wroth, sprang up. And springing upsuddenly, they by means of maces, dealt blows on the chestof the monkey, who was staying in the unclouded sky.Thereat resisting the furious rush of those gifted with ebullientenergy, that exceedingly powerful one descended to theearth with the violence of the Fair-feathered (bird).383 Thengetting at and uprooting a sāla tree, that monkey, theWind-god's offspring, slew both of those heroic Rākshasas.Learning that those three had been slain by the monkeygifted with speed, the mighty and onrushing Praghasalaughing in scorn advanced (in the encounter). And theenergetic Bhāsakarna also came forward in rage, taking adart. And (they) meeting together, Praghasa assailed thefamous, tiger-like monkey with a sharp-edged axe, andBhāsakarna (attacked) the elephantine monkey with a javelin.And with his limbs wounded by them, and his hair wettedwith blood, that monkey resembling in splendour the infantsun, grew furiously enraged. And that elephantine monkey,the heroic Hanumān, uprooting a mountain-peak, with beasts,snakes, and trees (in it), slew those Rākshasas; and, crushedby that mountain-summit, they were reduced to powder. Onthose five generals having fallen, the monkey slew theremaining forces. And as the thousand-eyed Deity destroyedAsuras, the monkey destroyed steeds with steeds, elephantswith elephants, warriors with warriors, and cars with cars.And with horses and elephants, swift steeds, with brokenwheels and mighty cars, and Rākshasas slain, all the wayswere blocked up. And having destroyed in battle the heroicgenerals with all their forces and vehicles, that hero inthe same way rested at the gate like Kāla himself engaged indestroying people, when he hath gained respite."

  "Āranya, Kishkindhā, and Sundara Kāndam": "Hearing that the five generals had been slain byHanumān alone with their vehicles and followers, the king,gazing at prince Aksha, who was ready and eager to go tobattle, commanded him to take the field. And that puissantone of a bow decked with gold, on being commanded (byRāvana) with a glance, started up, like unto fire on beingfed by clarified butter by foremost regenerate persons on thesacrificial ground. And that best of Nairitas384 possessed ofprowess, ascending a car resembling the infant sun ineffulgence, and surrounded all round with networks ofburnished gold, sallied forth in quest of that mighty monkey.And (that warrior) in prowess resembling an immortal, salliedout ascending that car, obtained with long-contianedasceticism, embellished with a network of glowing gold,furnished with pennons, having a standard studded with gems,nicely yoked with eight excellent steeds having the fleetnessof thought, incapable of being overpowered either bycelestials or Asuras, competent to course over uneven ground,of the lustre of lightning, sky-ranging, completelygarnished, equipped with quivers, with swords fastened tothe banners in eight directions, with darts and lancesarranged in proper places, splendid with every object in fullmeasure, bearing golden threads, wearing the brilliancyof the sun and moon, and possessing the effulgence of thesun. And filling the firmament and the earth containingmountains with sounds proceeding from steeds, elephants andmighty cars,—he, accompanied by his forces, presentedhimself before the capable monkey, who was seated at thegate. And coming before the monkey, Aksha, having thegaze of a lion,with eyes betokening regard, gazed at Hanumānresembling the Fire on the occassion of the universaldissolution at the end of a yuga, intent on destroying creatures, andwho was seated and was influenced alike by surprise andregard. And seriously considering the impetuosity of thehigh-souled monkey as well as his prowess in relation to afoe,—as also his own strength, he increased (in strength) likethe Sun on the expiration of a Yuga. And growing enraged,(Aksha), staying calmly in the field, with concentrated soul,challenged Hanumān difficult to resist in conflict and ofprowess worthy to witness, with three whetted shafts. Andfinding the monkey proud and untiring, capable ofvanquishing his foe, and possessed of exalted spirits, Aksha took uphis bow and held his arrows in his hands. And wearinga golden corslet, angadas, and earings, and possessed offiery vigor, he closed with the monkey; and their meetingwas something unparalleled on this earth,—and wascalculated to raise the respect385 even of the celestials and theAsuras. And witnessing the mighty conflict of the princeand the monkey, Earth emitted cries, and the Sun did notburn, and the Wind did not blow, and the mountains shook,and the welkin sounded, and the main was vexed. Andthat hero, skilled in aiming, fixing and discharging arrows,shot at the monkey's head three fine-headed feathered shaftsplated with gold near the feathers, and resembling venomousserpents. And with his rolling eyes washed with blood inconsequence of the shafts having alighted at his head,Hanumān, resembling a new-risen Sun having arrows for itsrays, looked splendid like the light-engarlanded Sun. Andseeing in battle that son of the foremost of monarchs, withhis excellent weapons upraised and his beautiful bow, thatbest of the counsellors of the lord of monkeys, rejoiced, andintent on encounter, increased himself. And with his ireheightened, that one endowed with energy and prowess, likeunto the ray-decorated (Sun) on the crest of Mandara,386 beganto burn with the fiery rays of his eyes, Aksha, along withhis forces and vehicles. And as a mass of clouds showerethrain on a high hill, the arrow-showering Rākshasa resemblingclouds, having the bow for his rain-bow, discharged shaftsat that foremost of monkeys, representing a mountain. Andthen the monkey, having sounds like those of clouds,beholding in battle Aksha of terrific prowess in conflict,and strong in energy, strength and shafts, sent up shoutsfrom elation of spirits. And as an elephant approacheth adeep pit covered over with grass, (Aksha) from a spirit ofchildishness elated in conflict with his prowess, with his ireheightened, and eyes resembling blood, drew near themonkey in the field. And as Aksha went on hastily pouringshafts, that one uttering roars resembling the rumbling ofclouds, looking terrible in consequence of his arms and thighsflung about, darted into the sky with exhuberant energy. Andas he leapt up, that strong and powerful one—foremost ofRākshasas—that car-warrior and the best of choicecar-warriors—rushed at (Hanumān), showering arrows on him,like a cloud showering hail-stones on a mountain. Anddashing in the midst of the arrows like the wind, and thusbaffling them, the heroic monkey of dreadful prowess inconflict, and endowed with the speed of thought, began torange the path of the air. And witnessing Aksha withregardful eyes, as that one intent on contest, taking his bow,was covering the sky with various excellent arrows, theWind-god's offspring was plunged in thought. Wounded inthe arm with shafts by that high-souled, noble prince, thatmighty-armed one, capable of adequately appreciating thenature of actions, thought on (Aksha's) prowess in battle.\"This exceedingly powerful one, endowed with the splendourof the infant sun, is doing dire deeds incapable of beingdone by a boy; and I am loth to slay one that hath shownhimself equal to every martial feat. This one is high-souled,mighty in energy, of concentrated self, and capable of bearingextreme hardships in war; without doubt, by virtue ofhis actions, he is worthy of being honored by Nāgas, Yakshasand ascetics. With his mind braced by prowess and hope, thatforemost of heroes eyeth me staying in the fore-front. Theprowess of this light-handed (one), I ween, maketh eventhe hearts of the celestials and Asuras tremble. If Idisregard him, he shall certainly vanquish me, for hisprowess in battle increaseth (fast). Therefore I must evenslay him: it is not proper to suffer an increasing fire.\" Thusreflecting on the strength of his foe and having ascertainedhis line of action, that puissant one endowed with greatstrength, summoned energy and set his heart on slayinghim (his antagonist). And remaining in the path coursedby the air, that heroic monkey, the offspring of the Wind-god,with his slaps slew his eight powerful and excellent steeds,capable of bearing pressure and trained to diverse circularmovements. And successfully assailed by the councilorof that lord of monkeys, the car with its seat smashed, andits pole broken, and deprived of its steeds, fell to the earthfrom the sky. Thereat, forsaking that car, the mightycar-warrior sprang up into sky with his bow and holding hissabre,—and (resembled) an ascetic of fierce energyconsequent on austerities, going up to heaven, renouncing hisbody. Then the monkey possessed of the energy and vigorof the Wind, approaching him as he was ranging the aircoursed by the king of birds, the Wind and the Siddhas, atlength fast caught hold of his legs. And as the foremost ofbirds, Garuda taking a mighty serpent, whirls it, that foremostof monkeys, resembling his sire in prowess, whirling Akshain the conflict, violently dropped him on the earth. Andwith his arms, thighs and chest crushed, bleeding, (havinghis bones and eyes smashed, his joints riven, and his tendonssnapped, the Rākshasa lay on the earth, slain by the offspringof the Wind-god. And tormenting him (Aksha) on the earth,that mighty monkey caused great fright unto the ruler of theRākshasas; and he was gazed at by the assembled Maharshisand the orbit-coursing ones and all beings with Yakshasand Pannagas, come to see him. And on the princebeing slain, that monkey was gazed at by the celestials withIndra, who had been seized with extreme wonderment.And having slain in battle prince Aksha resembling a sonof the celestials and possessed of blood-red eyes, the hero(again) neared the same gate, and waited there like Kālabent upon destroying all creatures."

And coping(in conflict) with thy might of arms, all the celestials withthe Maruts, headed by the lord of celestials himself, couldnot stay in the field. And there is none in these three worlds(save thyself), who doth not come under the influence offatigue in battle. And thou art preserved by the prowessof thy arms, and protected also by thy ascetic merit; andbeing skilled in the knowledge of season and place, thou,methinks, art the foremost of them all in intelligence. Andthere is no deed which thou canst not perform in the field;and there is nothing in counsel capable of being arrived atby arguing on the lines prescribed by the scriptures, whichthou art not equal to; and there is none in all the threeworlds who doth not know thy strength and prowess in arms.And thy ascetic energy is like unto mine, as well as thyprowess and might in arms in battle. And having theein the conflict, my mind assured (of victory), doth notexperience sorrow. Slain have been all the servants, as alsoJamvumāli, and those five generals, the heroic sons of mycouncilors, and the swelling forces including steeds,elephants and cars. And low lieth Mahodara, and princeAksha hath also been slain. O destroyer of foes, my minddid not feel the same confidence in them that I do in thee.388And seeing this mighty host slain, as well as the prowessand energy of the monkey, and the taking into considerationthine own strength, do thou put forth thy energy accordingto thy strength, And on nearing the scene (of conflict),do thou, O foremost of those bearing arms, seeing thineown strength and that of the foe, so exert thyself that thelatter, (now) resting quietly in consequence of having created acarnage (on the hostile hosts), may wax enfeebled.389 O hero,army can serve no purpose here; for hosts fly (before)Hanumān or are reduced to nothing. Neither can it availto use arms of terrific power and resembling the thunderbolt.Nothing can resist the rush of the Wind-god's offspring;and this one like unto fire is incapable of being slain withweapons. Revolving well (in thy mind what I have remarked),do thou in order to the attainment of success, with anintent mind remember the divine virtue of this bow, andrepairing (to battle) strive to vanquish the foe, baffling hisattacks.390 O foremost of intelligent ones, (that I sendthee to battle) is certainly not proper; yet this course ofaction is endorsed by Kshatriyas and those followingthe morality of kings. O subduer of enemies, one should beversed in various branches of learning as well as be masterfulin war.391 He that craves victory in fight, should beacquainted with various branches of knowledge.392"

Excited with a desire for fight and worked upwith energy, Indrajit, eulogized by the friendly Rākshasas,set out for battle. And that highly effulgent and gracefulson of the lord of the Rākshasas, having expansive eyesresembling lotus-petals,—issued out like unto the rising ofthe ocean during a parva.393 Thereupon Indrajit ofunbearable prowess, equal to the lord of the celestials, ascendeda car drawn by four horses, having sharpened teeth andresembling Garuda in velocity. And that master of a car andforemost of bowmen, conversant with the use of all weapons—the best of those using swords—proceeded soon in his carwhere Hanumān was. And hearing the sound of his car andthe twang of his bow, that heroic monkey attained an excessof delight. And taking up a bow and sharpened darts,Indrajit, versed in the rules of war, proceeded towardsHanumān. And as he issued out for battle, greatly delighted,with arrows in his hands, all the quarters became dark,and jackals began to set up terrible cries. And therearrived the Nāgas, the Yakshas, the Maharshis, the planets,and the Siddhas, and the birds, covering the welkin, and,greatly delighted, began to make a noise. And beholding thatcar having a flag like that of Indra, approach very quickly,the monkey began to emit terrible roars and increasehimself. And Indrajit too, seated on the celestial car andhaving a painted bow, began to stretch it, emitting a soundresembling that of thunder. Thereupon closed in conflictthose two greatly powerful (heroes)—gifted with swiftmovements and fearless in battle—the monkey, and the son of thelord of Rākshasas, like unto the lords of celestials and Asuras.And baffling the shafts of that hero of a mighty car, anaccomplished bowman and a finished warrior, the immeasurablypowerful monkey increasing himself began to range inthe welkin.394 Thereupon the heroic (Indrajit)—slayer offoes—began to discharge incessantly shafts, large, sharp,well-feathered, painted in gold and swift-coursing like untothunder. And hearing again the noise of his car, the sounds ofdrums, bugles, and war-drums, and the twangs of the bow, heagain leaped up (in the sky). And baffling the aim of (Indrajit),who had always an eye on it, that great monkey ranged ata distance from those shafts. And again facing the arrowsand stretching his hands, the Wind-god's son again leaped up.And those two heroes,gifted with swift movements and versedin the art of war, engaged in a combat, admired of allbeings. And Hanumān could not find out the short-comings ofthe Rākshasa, nor could that high-souled one detect theweak points of the son of the Wind-god. And these twogifted with celestial prowess, engaged in conflict, becameunbearable unto each other. And seeing him unhurt thoughaimed at with infallible arrows, the high-souled (Indrajit),controlling his senses, engaged in deep and devout meditation395(to realize the true identity of Hanumān). Thereupon, thatson of the lord of Rākshasas pinned his thoughts uponthat foremost of monkeys, and, finding him incapable ofbeing slain, he began to devise plans how he could be bound.And that hero, foremost of those versed in the use ofweapons, discharged at that best of monkeys the highlypowerful weapon conferred on him by Brahmā, theGreat-father of the celestials. And knowing him incapable of beingslain, Indrajit conversant with the use of weapons, boundthat large-armed son of the Wind-god with that weapon.And being bound up by that Rākshasa with the weapon,the monkey became motionless and fell down on the earth.And thinking that he was bound up with a Brahmā weapon,he did not feel the least pain in consequence ofBrahmā's blessing. And that heroic monkey began tothink of the boons conferred on him by the Great-fatherof the celestials. And thinking that the weapon wasconferred by the Self-create and consecrated by sacredMantras, Hanumān began to think of boons conferredby the Great-father. \"In consequence of the power of theLord of creation I am incapable of extricating myselffrom these bonds.\" (Knowing this by means of devoutmeditation,he reflected again,)—\"This has been ordained by Him, andI must put up with this pain for sometime.\" Revolving wellthe power of the weapon, the boon of the Great-father, andhis own prowess to extricate himself from the bonds, themonkey followed the Great-father's behest,—\"I do not fearthough bound by this weapon, since I am being protected byBrahmā, Indra and the Wind-god. It will be better if I amcarried off by the Rākshasas, for I shall reap verygreat benefit by my conversation with the lord of Rākshasas.Therefore let the enemies carry me.\" Having resolvedthis, the considerate (monkey)—slayer of foes—remainedmotionless. And being ruthlessly bound by the foesand remonstrated with by them, he began to moan piteously.And beholding that slayer of foes motionless, the Rākshasasbound him up with cotton and bark. And he gladlyallowed himself to be tied up and rebuked by his enemies,thinking that he might converse with the lord of theRākshasas, if he, out of curiosity, should like to see him.Being bound with bark, that powerful (monkey) gothimself freed from the binding of the weapon, for the bindingforce of a Brahmā weapon becomes null when there isany other binding. And beholding that best of monkeys tiedup with bark and liberated from the binding of the weapon,Indrajit reflected that the binding force of the Brahmā weaponbecame powerless when there was any other binding. \"Alas,(those Rakshas) have rendered my mighty deed fruitless.They know not the action of Mantras.396 And on theBrahma weapon being baffled, any other weapon cannot effectanything; and thus we have all been placed in a criticalpredicament.\" On being released from the weapon, Hanumāndid not betray any signs of his liberation, albeit he waspulled by the Rākshasas and pained by the bonds they hadbound him with. And the monkey, Hanumān, was pulled bythose cruel Rākshasas having fatal boxes, in the direction ofthe lord of Rākshasas. And seeing (Hanumān) freed from the(Brahmā) weapon yet bound by the bark of trees, he (Indrajit)showed the exceedingly powerful and highly heroic monkeyunto the king along with his adherents. And the Rākshasasrelated unto the ruler of Rakshas everything touching thatforemost of choice monkeys, resembling a mad elephantwho was in bonds. \"Who is he? And whose son? Andwherefrom? And what's his errand? And by whom is hebacked?\"—thus did the heroic Rākshasas converse onbeholding Hanumān. And others said,—\"Kill him,\" \"Burnhim\"—\"Eat him up.\" The Rākshasas, growing enraged, thussaid unto each other.—Having passed some way, thatmagnanimous one saw there old servants sitting at the feetof the lord of Rākshasas,—as well as a mansion embellishedwith countless jewels. And the exceedingly energeticRāvana saw that foremost of monkeys dragged hither andthither by Rākshasas of frightful forms. And that best ofmonkeys too saw that lord of Rākshasas, endowed withstrength and energy and resembling the resplendent son.And with his reddened eyes rolling, the ten-neckedgazing at that monkey, ordered his principal counsellors,boasting of high pedigree and noble character, (tointerrogate the incomer). And by turns questioned by themas to his mission and purpose, as well as the fundamentaloccasion (of his inroad), that foremost of monkeys replied,—\"A messenger, I come (from Sugriva.)\""

If the lord of Rākshasas were not impious untothe height, this one could well be the protector themselvesof the celestial regions with Sakra.

And what hath beenhis purpose in entering my metropolis incapable of beingsubdued; and what for did he also fight (with my retainers?)Do thou ask the wicked-minded one about this.\" HearingRāvana's speech, Prahasta said,—\"Take heart!

But if thou shouldst sayaught untruthful, thy life shall pay dear for it. Or tell uswherfore thou hast entered into Rāvana's mansion.\" Thusaddressed then, that foremost of monkeys said unto the lordof Rākshasas,—\"I am not Sakra's, nor Yama's, nor Varuna's.I have no friendship with Dhanada,400 nor have I beendespatched by Vishnu. This is my race; and I have comehither a monkey for obtaining a sight of the Rākshasachief.

  "Āranya, Kishkindhā, and Sundara Kāndam": "Seeing the Ten-necked one of mighty energy, thatforemost of monkeys, endued with strength, calmly spokeunto him words containing sense,\"—I have come untothee at the command of Sugriva, O lord of Rākshasas. Thybrother, the king of monkeys, enquires after thy welfare.Listen to the desire of thy brother, the high-souled Sugriva,and his words fraught with righteous sense and capable ofworking one's good here and hereafter. King Daçaratha,master of cars and elephants and steeds,—is the friend ofall like unto their father, and is furnished with the splendourof the sovereign of celestials. His eldest son,—mighty-armed,and masterful, the darling (of his sire), hath, in accordancewith his father's order, entered the forest of Dandaka withhis brother Lakshmana and his wife Sitā. His name isRāma, and he is exceedingly energetic, and ever abidethon the path of virtue. His spouse, the celebrated Sitā,daughter unto Videha, the high-souled king Janaka, eitherdied or was carried off in Janasthāna. Seeking for thatexalted lady, the king's son, accompanied by his youngerbrother, arriving at Rhrishyamuka, met with Sugriva. AndSugriva promised that he would undertake the search forSitā, and Rāma (on his part promised) that he would conferon Sugriva the kingdom of the monkeys. And, thereupon,slaying Vāli in battle, the king's son established Sugrivaas the lord of the monkeys. Thou formerly hast knownthat foremost of monkeys, Vāli. That monkey was slainin battle by him (Rāma) with a single shaft. And, thereupon,the lord of monkeys, Sugriva, true to his vow, eager forsearching Sitā, despatched monkeys in all directions. Andthousands and hundreds and niyutas of monkeys areexploring all sides, below and above in the sky. And some arelike Vinatā's offspring,402 and some like the Wind; theircourse is incapable of being resisted; and those heroicmonkeys are endued with strength and celerity. I, Hanumānby name, am the son of the Wind-god. For Sitā, I, desirousof seeing her, have come hither, bounding over the mainmeasuring a full hundred Yojanas. And as I was roving, Icame to see Janaka's daughter in thy house. Thou artcognizant of righteousness and interest, and hast attainedprosperity through thy asceticism. Therefore, O eminentlywise one, thou ought not to confine another's wife. Actionsopposed to righteousness, and bringing on countless evils,and causing extermination,—ill become persons of thy sort.Who is there even among celestials and Asuras that iscompetent to stay before the shafts shot by Lakshmana andRāma in wrath? There is none, O king, in all the threeworlds, that is capable of attaining ease, after inflictinginjury on Rāghava. Treading the path of virtue and profit,do thou pay heed unto my speech fraught with good forthree times;403 and do thou return Jānaki unto thatforemost of men. Seen have I this exalted lady,—which wasdifficult to compass. As for what remaineth to be done,Rāma himself shall bring it about. That Sitā I have beheldoverwhelmed with grief, whom, albeit resembling afive-hooded serpent in thy mansion, thou knowst not. Andeven as food thoroughly mixed with poison, being taken, isincapable of being digested, this one is incapable of beingsubdued even by the celestials and Asuras. It is not proper todestroy religious merit reaped by undergoing extrememortification, as well as access of life (attained by the samemeans).404 Thou deemst thyself by virtue of thy asceticismincapable of being destroyed by the celestials and Asuras;and herein thy great merit (incident to thy austerities) isthe cause.—But Sugriva is not a god or a Yaksha or aRākshasa. Rāghava, O king, is a mortal and Sugriva isthe lord of monkeys. How canst thou, O king, save thylife from them? He that, confiding in his strength, committethhimself to foul proceedings, cannot count upon his righteousdeeds, but his evil ones follow him. Virtue destroyeth vice,(yet vice like thine destroyeth all virtue).405 Thou, without doubt,hast obtained the fruit of thy righteousness, and the fruitalso of this iniquity thou shalt reap without delay. Andtaking to heart the carnage in Janasthāna and the slayingof Vāli as well as the friendship of Rāma with Sugriva, dothou understand thine own good. I, alone that I am, can atmy will destroy Lankā with her steeds and elephants andcars; but he whose envoy I am hath not yet decided onthis point. Rāma hath in presence of the tawny-eyed (ones)forsooth promised the annihilation of the foe by whom Sitāhath been sore oppressed. On wronging Rāma, Purandarahimself cannot escape scot-free,—what shall I say of personslike thee? Her whom thou knowest as Sitā staying in thineabode—know her for the Fatal Night that shall bringdestruction down on all Lankā. Therefore, beware of thyselfturning about thy neck the fatal noose in the shape of Sitā!Do thou rather study thy welfare. Thou shalt behold thiscity crowned with edifices and stalls, in flames fed by thewrath of Rāma, and consumed by the energy of Sitā. Donot bring to destruction thine friends and ministers, andkindred, and brethren and sons, and thine entire welfare,—thine enjoyments and wives and this Lankā. O sovereignof the Rākshasas, do thou faithfully listen to these wordsof me, a monkey and the servant and envoy of Rāma.Abolishing all the worlds with their creatures mobileand immobile objects, the illustrious Rāma is capable ofcreating these anew. Neither among celestials nor Asuras,Yakshas, Rakshas, nor serpents, Vidyādharas, Nagās,Gandharbas nor beasts, Siddhas, the foremost Kinnaras,nor all birds,—nowhere among any class of beings in alltime breathes he who can cope with Rāma equal to Vishnu'sself in prowess. Having done such a wrong unto theforemost of all creatures—even unto that lion of a monarch,Rāma, thy life is in high peril. Neither deities nor Daityas,nor the foremost night-rangers, nor Gandharbas andVidyidharas, nor Nāgas, nor Yakshas, can stay in fight againstRāma—the leader of these three worlds. And neitherBrahmā, self-create, having four countenances, nor thethree-eyed Rudra, destroyer of Tripura, nor the august Indra,the generallissimo of the celestials, can stay in fight beforeRāma.\" Hearing the distasteful yet excellent speech of thebold and matchless monkey, the ten-necked one, with his eyeswhirling in wrath, ordered the destruction of that mightymonkey."

  "Āranya, Kishkindhā, and Sundara Kāndam": "Hearing the words of the high-souled monkey, Rāvana,bereft of his senses by wrath, ordered that he should be put todeath. On the death of that one who had proclaimed his ownposition of being an envoy, having been ordered by thewicked-minded Rāvana, Vibhishana did not agree (with the decision).And knowing that the lord of Rākshasas was wroth and thatthat affair406 was at hand, Vibhishana, resolved to act accordingto justice, began to reflect as to what was to be done.Having arrived at a decision, that one skilled in speech,paying homage unto that conqueror of foes, his elder brother,spoke unto him in words eminently good,—\"O lord ofRākshasas, forgive me and renounce thy wrath.407 Extendthy favor unto me, and hear these words of mine. Lords ofthe earth, endowed with integrity and knowing high andlow, never put messengers to death. The taking themonkey's life, O king, is opposed to morality and repugnantto social usage; and it is also unworthy of thyself. Thouunderstandst morality, art grateful and versed in the moralityof sovereigns, and canst distinguish between high and lowamong beings, and even thou knowst the prime sense ofthings. If discerning persons like thee come under thegovernance of passion, mere toil is the pains that are undergone tomaster the scriptures. Therefore, O destroyer of enemies,be pacified. O lord of Rākshasas, difficult to approach,consider what is proper or otherwise, and then do thou meteout punishment to the envoy.\" Hearing Vibhishana's speech,Rāvana lord of Rākshasas, overcome with a mighty wrath,answered,—\"O slayer of foes, to slay the sinful doth notcause sin. Therefore shall I slay this monkey, worker ofiniquity.\" Hearing these words grounded in unrighteousness,evil every way, and worthy of the base, that foremost ofintelligent ones, Vibhishana, spoke words couching supremeimport,—\"O lord of Lankā, be propitious. O Sovereign ofRākshasas, listen to speech containing the significance ofvirtue and profit. O king, an envoy is not to be put to deathon the occasion of his discharging his proper functions.This righteous people say everywhere unto all. Surely thisis an overgrown enemy; and he hath perpetrated immenseinjury (unto us). But say the good, envoys are not to beslain, albeit many are the punishments that have beenassigned for messengers. Disfigurement of the body, stripes,shaving of the head,—one of these or all combined,—theseare said to be the punishments that should be inflicted onenvoys. But I have not heard of the punishment of deathbeing a penalty of the envoy. Why doth one like thee,having one's intelligence rendered meek as respectsrighteousness and profit, and capable of proceeding on certaindecisions on the merits or otherwise of things,—come underthe sway of passion? Those possessed of power nevergive way to anger. Neither in religious discussion, nor insocial concerns, nor in appropriating the right sense ofthe scriptures, is there any that can approach thee, O hero.Verily thou art the foremost among celestials and Asuras.Invincible to the gods and Asuras themselves gifted withprowess, high spirits and intelligence, thou hast in battleoftentimes put to the rout the chiefs of celestials andmonarchs. Those heroes that have heretofore mentallyentertained enmity against such a one as thou, foe of deitiesand Daityas,—heroic and valient and unconquerable, havenot been deprived by thee of their lives.408 Nor do I see anygood that may likely accrue to us from the slaying of thismonkey. Let thy vengeance descend on those that havedespatched the monkey. Whether honest or otherwise, thisone hath been commissioned by others. Advocating interestnot his own and identifying himself with another, an envoydoth not merit the being put to death. O king, if this onebe slain, no other sky-ranger whatever would show himselfunto us. Therefore, O captor of hostile capitals, do not seekto slay this one. Thou shouldst spend thyself on celestialswith Indra (at their head). On his being killed, another seeI not who, O thou that lovest warfare, can move thosehaughty sons of a king to take up arms against thee. And,O bringer-in of joy unto the heart, it is not proper for thee,invincible to celestials and Asuras gifted with prowess, highspirits and intelligence, to disappoint the Nairitas (as to theireagerness for encounter). They are devoted to thy good,and are heroic and intent on thy well-being, born in lineshaving high and fiery virtues, and endowed with intelligence,—the flower of those bearing arms—and have beenmaintained by thee. Therefore let a portion of the forces, havingreceived thy order, march to-day, and bring (hither) thosefoolish princes. It is meet that thou shouldst display thyprowess before foes.\" Thereat, the lord of the night-rangers,that potent enemy of the celestials and the foremost ofRākshasa monarchs, lending free play to his intellect,accepted the excellent words of his younger brother."

But let him be punished with any chastisementsave slaying. Certainly the tail is a darling ornament to amonkey. Therefore let his tail be set on fire anon;and this having been consumed, let him go away. Thenshall his best friends and kindred and acquaintances seehim crest-fallen, with his person deformed.\" And the lordof Rākshasas ordered,—\"With his tail in flames, let this onebe taken all round Lankā containing terraces.\" Hearinghis words, the Rākshasas, cruel through wrath, cover up his(Hanumān's) tail with worn pieces of cotton cloth. Thereat,even as fire in a forest increaseth on getting dry fuel, themighty monkey grew in dimensions on his tail being wrappedup. And having soaked (the cloth) in oil, they set fire toit. Thereat with his soul overpowered with rage andhatred, and his countenance like the risen sun, he lashedthem with his flaming tail. And those—rangers of thenight—those Rākshasas—old and young and females—againbringing that foremost of monkeys, grew exceedingly glad.And that hero (being bound), entertained a purpose inharmony with the season. \"Albeit bound, the Rākshasascannot forsooth cope with me. Snapping these bonds, Ishall, darting up, again slaughter these. Although agreeablyto the mandate of their master these wicked-minded oneshave bound me, yet have they not been able to clear scoreswith me. I can slay all these Rākshasas in battle; but Isuffer this (maltreatment) for not marring the (pure delight)Rāma shall derive from my deed.409 I shall once more rangearound Lankā. Let this be so. At night I could notsatisfactorily examine the fortifications.410 For certain, by me isto be beheld Lankā when night hath departed. Let thembind me anew. The Rākshasas pain me by setting fire tomy tail; but my mind doth not tire.\" Then the Rākshasas,rejoicing greatly, went off, taking that mighty monkeyendowed with strength, an elephant (in prowess) amongmonkeys. And blowing conchs and trumpets, and bruitingit abroad by various actions,411 those Rākshasas of cruel deedstook (Hanumān) about the city (of Lankā). And led bythose Rākshasas, that subduer of enemies, Hanumān,experienced delight, and going about the mighty metropolis ofthe Rākshasas, the redoubted monkey surveyed variegatedcars, enclosed court-yards, well-ordered terraces, streetsthronged with edifices, crossings, by-ways, and the interiorsof dwellings. And on terraces and highways the Rākshasasproclaim the monkey, saying,—\"This is a spy.\" OnHanumān's tail being in flames, Rākshasis of frightful eyesrelated unto that exalted lady412 tidings of this great mishap.\"O Sitā, the copper-faced monkey with whom thou hadstheld talk, is being led around with his tail flaming.' Hearingthese cruel words, like unto loss of life, Vaidehi, burning ingrief, approached the Fire. And wishing for the welfare of themighty monkey, that large-eyed lady with an intent mindbegan to pray unto that bearer of sacrificial offerings,—\"IfI have served my lord, if I bear a character, if I have asceticmerit, if I have been the wife of one alone, then prove thoucool unto Hanumān.\" Thereat, as if communicating thewelfare of the monkey unto that one having eyes like thoseof a young deer, the Fire flamed up,—and Hanumān's sire,albeit furnished with fire and a tail, blew ice cold before thatworshipful one, breathing health (unto Hanumān). On histail flaming, the monkey reflected,—\"This fire is flaming.Why doth it not then burn me all over? I see it of exceedingbrightness, yet it paineth me not. (On the contrary), at theend of my tail it seemeth like a mass of ice. Or this isclearly due to Rāma's power, even like the wonder (that Iwitnessed) while bounding over the main—the mountainunder the lord of streams.413 If the Ocean and the intelligentMaināka could show such regard for Rāma, what may notthe Fire do (for him?) Fire doth not burn me for Sitā's(absolute) goodness, for Rāghava's prowess, and for (his)friendship with my sire.\" Then the elephantine monkeyagain reflected for a while,—\"Why should one like mesuffer one's self to be bound by vile Rākshasas? Thereforeit is meet that I should, displaying my prowess, avenge (thiswrong).\" Thereat that vehement and mighty monkeysnapped his bonds, and furiously springing into the sky, theterrible monkey uttered a shout. And then the graceful sonof the Wind-god arrived at the gate of the city resemblinga hill, where Rakshas there were none. And after havingattained the magnitude of a mountain, anon that self-controlledone diminished himself and cast off his bonds. And havingfreed himself, the graceful one again becamemountain-like; and eying around, he saw a bolt standing against thegate. And that mighty-armed one, the Wind-god's son,taking up that bolt of burnished iron, again slaughtered theguards. And having slain the warders, that one of terrificprowess crowned with a luminous wreath forged from hisflaming tail, and appearing like the sun garlanded with glory,once again cast his eyes over Lankā."

And that monkey with a calm mind, eying (allround), ranged one house from another, and gardens, andstately piles. And that one gifted with exceeding vehemence,and in strength resembling the Wind, bounding up set fireunto the dwelling of Prahasta. Then Hanumān endowedwith prowess, leaping up, set unto Mahāparçwa's mansionfire resembling that at the universal dissolution. And (then)the mighty monkey darting up, set fire unto Vajradanshtra's;and (then) that highly energetic one set fire unto Suka's andunto the intelligent Sārana's.

And leaving alone the dwelling of Vibhishana,that exceedingly energetic one—foremost of monkeys—byand by burnt (all the houses there). And in those costlymansions and dwellings, that famous one, that foremost ofmonkeys, burnt all the wealth of those affluent persons.—Having passed the dwellings of all, that powerful andauspicious one approached the residence of the lord of Rākshasas,Rāvana. And in that foremost of mansions, adorned withvarious gems, resembling Meru or Mandara, graced withdiverse auspicious things, he set unto the same, fireflaming at the end of his tail. And the heroic Hauumānroars, resembling a cloud (appearing) at the end of a Yuga.And assisted by the wind, that highly powerful and vehementone (Fire) flaimed up, like fire at the wreck of all, andthe fire attained energy. And the wind spreading theflaming fire all round those dwellings, those mansionsfurnished with golden networks; and containing pearls andgems; enjewelled and magnificent, were shorn of theirsplendour. And cracked edifices began to topple down tothe ground, like the mansions of Siddhas falling from thefirmament on the exhaustion of their righteousness. Andthere arose a mighty uproar of those Rākshasas, as, bereftof their good fortune, despairing of preserving their abodes,they rushed in all directions,—\"Forsooth it is Fire himselfthat hath come hither in the form of a monkey.\" Andfemales crying with babes on their breasts, suddenly plunged(into the fire). And some fair ones with hair dishevelled,and surrounded on all sides with fire, as they fell down fromdwellings, looked lovely like lightning from the welkin.And he (Hanumān) saw various kinds of metals, mixed withdiamonds, and coral, and lapises and pearls and silver,runing down in streams from the mansions. And as Fire is notcloyed with wood and straw, Hanumān never at all feltsatiety on slaying those foremost of Rākshasas. And theEarth could not contain the Rākshasas slain by Hanumān.And as Rudra had burnt down Tripura, the vehement andhigh-souled monkey, Hanumān, burnt down Lankā. Andrising to the brow of Lankā's mount,415 the fire of terrificenergy kindled by the impetuous Hanumān, spread widehis tongues. And with the Wind assisting him, the smoklessFire in the dwellings, with his flames feeding on the bodiesof the Rākshasas representing sacrificial offerings, spreadhis magnitude, touching the horizen—resembling theconflagration kindled at the universal dissolution. Andpossessing the fierce energy of a koti suns, the mighty Firecompletely encompassing the entire Lankā, increased (involume), riving the mundane Egg with various soundsresembling thunder-claps.

Or is this theRākshasa-annihilating Fire of Brahmā himself—theGreat-sire of all, the four-faced Disposer of the world's destinies,—come hither, wearing the form of a monkey? Or is thisVishnu's Energy, inconceivable, unutterable, infinite and sole,and of surpassing power,—now come hither in its ownillusory nature, assuming a monkey-form?\" Seeing that citysuddenly consumed, with her souls, dwellings, and trees,Rākshasas of note, assembled together, thus talked unto eachother. And then Lankā, suddenly consumed with Rākshasas,horses, cars, serpents, crowds of birds, beasts and trees, beganto bewail tumultuously and loud in forlorn guise,—\"Ofather! O son! O love! O friend! O lord of my life andframe! all our religious merit is abolished.\" Indulging invarious lamentations, the Rakshas thus created a mighty andfrightful uproar. And with the flames encircling her, andher foremost heroes fallen, and her warriors destroyed,Lankā, overcome by the might of Hanumān's wrath, becameas if she had been blighted by an imprecation. Then themighty-minded Hanumān beheld the Rākshasas in terror andtrepidation and castdown, and Lankā marked by fire andbright flames, even as the Self-sprung eyeth the world destroyedby his rage. And devastating the forest filled with manyexcellent trees, slaying many a terrible Rākshasa in conflict,and burning down the city of Lankā filled with picturesquehouses, the monkey, Hanumān, Wind-god's son, stationedhimself there. And destroying many a Rākshasa, fellingmany trees in the forest and setting fire to the houses of theRākshasas, the high-souled (monkey) became engaged inthoughts touching Rāma. Thereupon all the celestialspraised highly the high-souled, excellent and mighty son ofthe Wind-god, foremost of heroic monkeys, gifted with thevelocity of the Wind.

Andhaving devastated the forest, slain the Rākshasas in conflictand burnt the grand city of Lankā, the great monkeyappeared there. And seated on the variegated top of a splendid andhigh mansion, the foremost of monkeys, spreading the rays ofhis burning tail, looked like unto the sun of many rays. Andhaving consumed the city of Lankā, the great monkeyquenched the fire of his tail in the ocean.

Andworked up with fear and remorse, he reflected,—\"What a mightyiniquity have I perpetrated by burning down Lankā of my ownaccord? Blessed are those high-souled ones who control theirwrath by dint of their own good sense, like unto fire quenchedby water. What iniquity is there which cannot be perpetratedby the angry? They can even slay the worshipful and vilifythe pious with harsh words. The angry cannot decide whatshould be spoken and what not. There is no vice whichcannot be committed by them, and there is nothing whichcannot be spoken by them. He is the proper person who cansubdue his rising ire by means of forgiveness as a serpentleaves off his worn skin. O fie on me who am vicious-minded,shameless and the perpetrator of a mighty iniquity. Notthinking of Sitā, I have slain my master with fire. Forsoothhath the worshipful Jānaki been burnt, since the whole city ofLankā hath been devastated with fire. And she being burnt,foolishly have I spoilt the work of my master. I have defeatedthe great object for which I have laboured so much. Inburning down Lankā, I have not saved Sitā. To have burnt downLankā is assuredly a trifle, but in my ire I have lost my greatobject. Forsooth hath Janaki been consumed, since I beholdno spot in Lankā which is not made desolate with fire—in fact the whole city hath been reduced to ashes. As I havecommitted such an injury under the influence of my perverseunderstanding, it behoveth me to relinquish my life here. Ishall jump into this flame or into a submarine fire, or I shallresign my mortal frame to the animals that infest the ocean.For, living, I shall not be able to face that lord of monkeys,and how shall I, having spoilt their work utterly, show myselfunto those foremost of men? I have through my culpablepassion furnished an illustration of the recklessmonkey-nature, which is well known over the three worlds. Fie onthis activity, born of (the quality of) passion, which is thesource of incompetence and rashness; since although capable,I did not protect Sitā. On Sitā having met with destruction,both of them417 shall cease to exist; and on their ceasing toexist, Sugriva shall die along with his friends. And hearingthese tidings, how shall the righteous Bharata, attached untohis brother (Rāma), along with Satrughna, live? And onthe virtuous Ikshwāku race being extinct, without doubt, allthe subjects shall be overwhelmed with grief. Therefore,I of curst luck hath had my harvest of virtue and profittaken away; and being under the influence of baleful passion,I am the cause of the destruction of creatures.\" As he wasreflecting thus, he bethought him of auspicious omens whichhe had witnessed since. \"Or it may be that one of charminglimbs hath been preserved by her proper energy. Theblessed one may not have met with her end, for fire dothburn fire. And Fire should not touch the spouse of thatvirtuous one of immeasurable energy,—who is protected byby her own character. And that bearer of sacrificial offeringshath not burnt me, is owing to Rāma's power and the virtueof Vaidehi. And why should she that is a very goddess untothe three brothers, Bharata and the others, and that hathenchanted the mind of Rāma, meet with destruction? Andwhen that everywhere unspent Lord, having burning forhis office, hath not consumed my tail, why shoud he burn theexalted lady?\" Then Hanumān with wonder again thoughtof the sight of the golden mountain under the water.418 \"Byvirtue of her asceticism, veracity, and devotion unto her lord,she it is that can consume Fire, but Fire cannot burn her.\"And as Hanumān was thinking of the magnitude of thatrevered lady's religious merit, he heard the converse thereof high-souled Chāranas. \"Ah! hard is the feat thatHanumān hath forsooth achieved. He hath created a terrificand fierce conflagration in the abode of the Raksha. Thefemales of Rakshas accompanied by boys and old folks, areflying amain; and in consequence of the hubbub it seems asif (Lankā) is in lamentation through her mountain-caverns.Burnt is this city of Lankā with her turrets, walls andgateways; and we are astonished that Jānaki is not burnt.\"These words resembling ambrosia Hanumān heard (at thattime); and his mind was filled with joy. And what throughthe auspicious omens that he had witnessed, and whatthrough the speech of the saints, Hanumān was delighted(beyond measure). Then the monkey, with his end attained,knowing that the king's daughter was unhurt, became bentupon returning after seeing her once again."

On the lord of Rākshasas being slain along withhis sons, councilors, and friends, thou shalt meet with Rāmaas Rohini meeteth with the Moon. At once shall Kākutsthacome, accompanied by the foremost of monkeys,—who,conquering (Rāvana) in conflict, shall remove thy grief.\"Having thus consoled Videha's daughter, Hanumān, son untothe Wind-god, setting his heart upon departure, salutedVaidehi. And having soothed Vaidehi, and displayed hissurpassing strength, having rendered the city disconsolate,and baffled Rāvana, exhibited his terrific might, and salutedVaidehi, Hanumān became bent upon returning, crossing overthe mid-sea. Then that repressor of foes, the powerfulmonkey, anxious to see his master, ascended Aristha,foremost of mountains; (as if covered) with a sheet consistingof blue woods of tall padmakas, and clouds lying in theinterspace between peaks,—and displayed from love by theglad light of the Sun; appearing to be beholding with theminerals scattered about serving for its eyes; seeming to bereciting aloud in consequence of the solemn sound of waters,to be carolling clearly through its many fountains, and to staywith uplifted arms by means of devadarus; appearing to becrying distressfully on account of cascades sounding all round;seeming to be trembling in consequence of verdant autumnalwoods waving, and to be piping on account of kichakasvocal through the breeze; eloquent; with the foremostpoisonous serpents appearing to be sighing forth ire;appearing to be sunk in contemplation on account of cavernscovered with snow and looking solemn in consequence;as if moving about by means of hills looking likeits cloud-legs; seeming to yawn in the sky with peakstowering heavenwards,—scattered with summits, and gracedwith innumerable caves; surrounded with sālas, palms,tamālas, Karnas, and bamboos; graced with spreading andflowering underwoods; abounding in various beasts, anddecked with mineral streams,—containing numerous rills,—thronged with collections of crags; frequented by Maharshis,and Yakshas, and Gandharbas and Kinnaras and serpents;impracticable in consequence of plants and trees; withcaverns harbouring lions; filled with tigers and other(ferocious beasts); and furnished with trees having tastefulfruits and roots. And the Wind-god's offspring—foremost ofmonkeys—ascended that mountain. Aud on the lovely levelof that mountain, the crags, crushed with sounds under thetread of that one burning to behold Rāma and wrought upwith excess of joy, were scattered all round. And ascendingthat lordly hill, the mighty monkey magnified himself,desirous of going from the southern to the northern shoreof the salt waters. And getting to the top of the mountain,that hero, son unto the Wind-god, cast his eyes upon thedreadful main inhabited by terrible snakes. And thatforemost of monkeys, offspring of the Wind-god,419 (mentally)went from the south to the north, as if it were the air. Andthen that best of mountains, sore pressed by the monkey,began to emit cries, and with various creatures (on it), enteredunderneath the Earth, with its peaks tottering and its treestoppling. And borne down by the violence of his thighs,trees bearing flowers, being shattered, as if destroyed bySakra's weapon, fell to the ground. And the dreadful yellsof mighty lions in pain, inhabiting caves, entered the ear,piercing the heavens. And Vidyādharis with their attiresfalling off and their ornaments disordered, suddenly rosefrom the mountain420 unto the sky. And exceedingly powerfuland mighty snakes of virulent venom,—having flamingtongues, with their hoods and necks tortured, began to roll(on the earth). And Kinnars and serpents, Gandharbas,Yakshas and Vidyādharas, forsaking that foremost ofmountains in affliction, took refuge in the sky. And thatgraceful mountain also, tormented by that powerful one,entered the nether regions with its tall trees and summits.And that mountain, which (heretofore) had measured tenyojanas in area and thirty in height, became level with theearth. And desirous of crossing over the salt waters, withtheir shores menaced by sounding (waves), the monkey roseto the sky."

  "Āranya, Kishkindhā, and Sundara Kāndam": "And springing up like unto a winged hill, that oneendowed with energy, the untiring Hanumān, began to swimon the ocean of the firmament having for its blown lotuses andlilies, snakes, Yakshas and Gandharbas; with the Moon forits comely Kumuda;421 and with the Sun for its Kārandavas;charming to behold; having Tishya and Srāvana for itsswans, clouds for its mosses and grass, Punarvasu for itsmighty fish, the red-bodied one422 for its huge aquatic animal,Airāvata for its spacious island, Swāti for its sportiveswan, breezes for its billows, and moonlight for its coolwaters. And as if swallowing up the welkin and touchingthe lord of stars, abolishing the sky decorated with stars andthe solar disc, and cleaving the clouds, the unfatiguedHanumān began to cross over that sea. And (on all sides)mighty masses of clouds, sable, crimson, blue,Mangistha-hued, and green-red, looked exceedingly beautiful. Andnow entering into clouds and now imerging from them, he,again and again becoming visible and lost to sight, lookedlike the Moon. And that one clad in white raiment, coursingthrough diverse clouds, the hero's body was (alternately)visible and invisible, like unto the Moon in the sky. Andthe Wind-god's son went on in the sky, scattering the cloudsand descending again and again. And sending up mightysounds, that exceedingly energetic one gifted with apowerful voice like that of the clouds, having slain the foremostRākshasas and rendered his name famous, having filled thecity with lamentations and afflicted Rāvana, having distressedthe mighty heroes and paid obeisance unto Vaidehi,—againheld his course along the mid-ocean. And touchingMaināka—foremost of mountains—that one endowed withprowess proceeded amain like an iron dart let go from astring. And from a distance approaching and beholding thatmighty mountain, Mahendra, resembling clouds, thatredoubted monkey began to roar. And having a lusty voiceresembling that of clouds, that monkey, roaring, filled allquarters with his lofty shouts. And arriving at that place,he, eager to behold his friends, emitted tremendous roars,and began to flourish his tail. And as he went on roaringin the path ranged by Suparna, the firmament with the solardisc seemed to be rent by his shouts. And (it came topass that) those powerful and heroic (monkeys) that hadformerly stationed themselves on the northern shore of theocean, anxious to see the Wind-god's offspring, heard thesounds proceeding from Hanumān's vehement speed,resembling the rumbling of clouds agitated by the winds. Andall those rangers of woods, (staying) dispirited, heard theroars of that foremost of monkeys, like unto the roaring ofrain-pouring clouds. And hearing those sounds as he keptcrying, those monkeys (sitting) around, eager to see theirfriend, became extremely anxious. And that best ofmonkeys, Jambavān, with a joyful heart addressing all themonkeys, said,—\"Hanumān hath succeeded completely.There is no doubt about this. If he were unsuccessful, hewould not utter shouts as these.\" And hearing the soundsproduced by the violent movements of the arms of thathigh-souled (hero), as well as the shouts of that magnanimous one,the monkeys, filled with delight, leapt up on all sides. Andthey, eager to have a sight of Hanumān, joyfully went frommountain-top to mountain-top and from peak on to peak.And influenced by joy, the monkeys remained holding abough at the top of a tree, and waving their cleanapparels. And as the wind roareth in a cavern, roared thepowerful Hanumān, son unto the Wind-god. And seeingthat mighty monkey resembling a mass of clouds, alighting,those monkeys stood joining their hands. And then thevehement monkey resembling a hill, having leapt up fromthat mountain, alighted on the top of that (other) mountain423filled with trees. And bursting with delight, (Hanumān)dropped near a fountain, like unto a hill whose wings havebeen clipped. Then with joyful hearts, all the principalmonkeys stood encircling the high-souled Hanumān. Andsurrounding him, they experienced excess of delight, anddrew near the newcomer with joyful faces. Andbringing fruits and roots, the monkeys honored that chief ofmonkeys, the offspring of the Wind-god. And some, filledwith delight, sent shouts, and some raised ululations; andthe foremost monkeys fetched branches of trees.424 And thatmighty monkey, Hanumān, saluted his superiors and the aged,headed by Jambavān; as well as Prince Angada. Andhonored by the monkeys, as he very well deserved to be,and gratified by them, (he) briefly said—\"Seen have I theexalted lady.\" And taking Vāli's son by the hand, he sathim down in a charming tract of the woodland belongingto the mountain Mahendra.—Then asked (by them),Hanumān addressed those foremost monkeys,—\"I have seenJanaka's daughter in the Açoka woods. That blamelessone is guarded by dreadful Rākshasis. The girt weareth asingle braid of hair, and burneth to attain a sight of Rāma.She is faint in consequence of fasting, and dirty, wearethmatted locks and is emaciated.\" Hearing the words, \"Ihave seen\" from the Wind-god's offspring resemblingambrosia, all the monkeys were filled with rejoicing. Andthereupon, some of mighty ones roared, and some shouted,aid some blustered, and some raised ululations, and othersstormed (in return). And some elephantine monkeys in joyupraised their tails, and some lashed with their long andbroad tails. And others, transported with joy, bounding upto the mountain-summit, touched that foremost of monkeys,the handsome Hanumān. And when Hanumān had ended,Angada said these excellent words in the midst of the heroicmonkeys,—\"There is none, O monkey, that is like untothee in strength and prowess. As having bounded over thespacious main, thou hast come back (here), thou art, Oexcellent monkey, the only giver of our lives. By thygrace it is that, our end attained, we shall meet withRāghava. Oh for thy fidelity! Oh for thy prowess! Ohfor thy fortitude! By luck hast thou seen that exaltedone, the illustrious wife of Rāma, by luck it is that Kākutsthashall forego his sorrow in consequence of separation fromSitā.\" Then surrounding Angada, Hanumān, and Jāmbavān,the monkeys, exceedingly rejoiced, sat down upon a spaciousstone. And having sat them down on the spacious rock,the monkeys became eager to hear of the bounding of themain and of (Hanumān's) seeing Lankā, Sitā and Rāvana. Andthey stood with joined hands, looking wistfully into Hanumān'sface. And the graceful Angada was there, surrounded bymany monkeys, and honored by them, even as the lord ofcelestials is honored in heaven by the celestials. When thefamous and renowned Hanumān, and Angada with braceletson his arms, had sat down, the elevated and mightymountain-summit was illuminated with splendour."

  "Āranya, Kishkindhā, and Sundara Kāndam": "Then on the summit of the mountain, Mahendra, thosepowerful monkeys, headed by Hanumān, rejoiced exceedingly.And when the high-souled delighted monkeys had sat themdown, Jāmbavān, glad at heart, asked that offspring of theWind, the happy Hanumān, all about his proceeding: \"Howhast thou seen the worshipful one? How doth she farethere? And how doth the cruel Ten-necked one bearhimself towards her? Do thou truthfully relate all this unto us,O mighty monkey. How couldst thou track the exaltedlady? And what did she say in reply (to thy querries)?Having learnt the real state of things, we shall decide whatis to be done. And do thou also tell us what we, repairingthere, shall unfold unto that one of controled self and whatwe shall keep to ourselves.\" Thus directed by him, thatone (Hanumān) with his down standing on end, bowing downthe head unto that revered one, Sitā, replied,—\"In yoursight, I bounded up with a concentrated mind, eager to reachthe southern shore of the ocean. As I voyaged on, a greatimpediment occurred in the way. I saw a goodly and noblegolden peak, standing, obstructing my way. I found themountain as an obstacle to my course. Nearing the grandand splendid golden mount, I thought within myself,—'I willrive this.' And the sun-like summit of that mighty mountain,Prahasta, was cleft in a thousand fragments by my tail.Seeing his own condition, that mighty mountain, gladdeningmy heart, addressed me with the sweet speech,—'O son,know me for thy uncle. I am a friend unto the Wind,—famed as Maināka, and living in the great deep. Formerlyall the foremost mountains were furnished with wings. And(once on a time) they began to range the earth at will,committing devastations. Hearing of the conduct of themountains, that possessor of the six kinds of riches, Indrathe Great, the swayer of Paka, with his thunderbolt cut offby thousands the pinions of the mountains. At that time,my son, I, having been delivered by thy sire, the high-souledWind-god, was cast into the abode of Varuna. O repressorof foes, I shall have to assist Rāghava. Rāma is theforemost of the righteous, and possessed of prowess like that ofMahendra himself.' Having heard this from themagnanimous Maināka, I apprised the mountain of my mission, andmy thoughts held their course. Having given me hispermission, the magnanimous Maināka, the mountain that hadput on the form of a man, vanished, and, assuming hismountain-form, went into the vast sea. And I, summoningmy best celerity, began to journey the remainder of my way.And having swiftly proceeded long in the path, I saw theexalted lady, Surasā, mother of the serpents. And thatworshipful one stationed in the sea, said,—'By the celestialshast thou, O best of monkeys, been assigned as my food.Therefore shall I eat thee up. Thou hast been ordained asmine by the gods.' Thus addressed by Surasā, I, remainingin humble guise with joined hands, and with my countenanceturned pale, I uttered these words,—'Rāma, the gracefulson of Daçaratha, repressor of foes—hath entered the woodsof Dandaka, in company with his brother Lakshamana andSitā. His wife Sitā hath been carried off by the wickedRāvana. At Rāma's mandate I go to her as an envoy. Inthis business, thou, O chaste one, shouldst help Rāma. Orhaving seen Mithilā's daughter, as well as Rāma of untiringdeeds, I shall come to thy mouth,—this I promise unto theetruly.' Thus accosted by me, Surasā, wearing forms at herwill, said,—'None is able to escape me. Even this is theboon that I have received.' Having been thus addressedby Surasā, I attained the magnitude of ten yojanas; and thenanon I dilated to another ten. But she opened her mouthwider than my magnitude. Seeing her stretched mouth, Iagain diminished myself, and on the instant again reducedmyself to the measure of a thumb. And speedily entering hermouth, I immediately came out. Then the exalted Surasāagain spoke unto me in her native shape,—'Thy end havingbeen attained, go, O mild one, O foremost of monkeys,according to thy pleasure. Bring about the meeting ofVaidehi with the high-souled Rāghava. Be thou blessed, Omighty-armed one. I am well pleased with thee, O monkey.'Then I was praised by all beings, with,—'Excellent!''Excellent!' Then like unto Garuda I again sprang up intothe air. But now my shadow was overtaken by somebody,though I saw no one. And my velocity being deprived, Ilooked at the ten cardinal points; but I found there naughtwhich could deprive me of my speed. Then I thought,—'What is this obstacle that hath suddenly arisen in respectof my course? No form find I here?' And as I stoodaggrieved, my glance fell downwards. Then I saw there adreadful Rākshasi supine on the flood. And laughing(scornfully), that grim one said these inauspicious wordsunto me, who was inert, although undaunted,—\"Whitherart thou bound, O thou of a gigantic body? Desired byme, who am hungry, do thou becoming my food, gratify thisbody deprived of diet for a long time.' Saying, 'Well,' Iaccepted her speech, increasing my body at will morethan the capacity of her mouth; and her huge anddreadful mouth extended wide to eat me up. She did notunderstand me,425 nor that I had altered my shape. Then inthe twinkling of an eye contracting my vasty shape, I,extracting her heart, darted into the sky. Thereat, throwingabout her arms, that terrific one dropped into the salt waters.On that chaste one, resembling a hill, having her heart torn,I heard the meek speech of magnanimous persons, who hadcome there of themselves,—'This dreadful Rākshasi,Sinhikā, hath been swiftly slain by Hanumān.' Havingslain her, I again, remembering the delay that had occurredtouching my work, set out on the great road, and at lengthsaw the southern shore of the sea, covered with mountains;where is situated the city of Lankā. On the sun having set,I entered the city of the Rākshasas—their home—unnoticedby the Rākshasas of terrific vigor. I had entered in when acertain female casting forth violent laughter, and wearingthe splendour of clouds at the end of a Kalpa, presentedherself before me. And striking with my left clenched fistthat exceedingly dreadful (form), having flames for her hair,who had sought to take my life,—and vanquishing her (thus),I entered (Lankā) at dusk. Then that one affrightedaddressed me, saying,—'I, O hero, am, the city of Lankā.Vanquished have I been by thy prowess. Thou shalteverywhere conquer all the Rākshasas'. There I wanderedall the night (seeking for Janaka's daughter) and (atlength) entered Rāvana's inner apartment; but that oneof a Diity waist I found not. And not finding Sitā inRāvana's abode, I was cast in a sea of sorrow; nor found Ihow to cross over it. And as I was sorrowing, I saw amansion with a charming grove encircled by a wall ofexcellent gold. And leaping over the wall, I saw a groverife with trees; and (at last) saw in the midst of an açokawood a great Sinçapā. And ascending the tree, I saw a goldentract of plantains; and hard by from the Sinçapā tree Iespied that transcendentally beautiful one, dark-blue, havingeyes resembling lotus-petals, with her face faded inconsequence of fasting, clad in the same single piece of cloth, herhair covered with dust,—her limbs emaciated by the heatof sorrow and grief,—Sitā, ever engaged in the welfare ofher lord; surrounded by cruel and deformed Rākshasisliving upon blood and flesh,—like unto deer environed bytigresses. And I managed too swiftly to present myselfbefore that one, menaced momentarily in the midst of theRākshasis, wearing a single braid of hair; woe-begone;ever thinking of her lord; her limbs discolored by lyingdown on the ground, like unto a lotus on the approach ofwinter,—having eyes resembling those of a young deer, whohad turned her face away from all the enjoyments offeredby Rāvana, and who had resolved to put a period to herexistence. Seeing that lady the illustrious wife of Rāma inthat condition, I seeing her remained even on that Sinçapātree. Then I heard in Rāvana's mansion loud and solemnsounds mixed with the tinklings of zones and bangles.Thereat exceedingly agitated, I changed my proper shape; andremained like a bird in a dark part of the Sinçapā tree. Thenthe wives of Rāvana along with Rāvana himself ofexceeding strength came to that place where Sitā was. Andseeing the lord of Rākshasas the exceedingly beauteousSitā contracted her thighs and covered her full breasts withher arms. And seeing Sitā flurried and extremely excitedand casting about her gladness up and down, not finding anyrelief and trembling forlorn, the Ten-necked one said untoher undergoing extreme anguish,—\"Without sayinganything, I fall down (here). O fair one, do thou regard me.If, O haughty one, thou do not honor me from pride of heart,I shall, O Sitā, two months hence, see thy blood.\" Hearingthese words of the wicked Rāvana, Sitā, growing exceedingwroth, spoke these excellent words,—\"O worst of Rākshasas,having used improper speech towards the wife of Rāma ofmeasureless prowess, and the daughter-in-law of Daçaratha,lord of the Ikshwāku line, why hast thou not thy tonguefallen off? Fie upon the prowess of thee that, O wretch,hast carried me off while my husband was away; and notbeing seen of that high-souled one. Thou art never likeRāma,—thou art not even fit to be his slave. Rāghava isinvincible, truthful, heroic and (even) hungering for warfare.\"Thus addressed in harsh speech by Jānaki, the Ten-neckedone flamed up in wrath, like Fire in a funeral pyre. Andwith his wicked eyes whirling in rage, he raised the clenchedfist of his right hand to slay Mithilā's daughter; but thenthe females set up a cry of \"Oh\" and \"Alas.\" And risingup in the midst of the females, the wife of thewicked-minded one, the excellent one, named Mandodari, preventedhim. And she spoke soft words unto him influenced bylust.—\"O thou that resemblest Indra the Great in prowess.Do thou to-day sport with me. Jānaki is not superior to me.And, O lord, do thou sport with the daughters of celestialsand Gandharbas, and with the daughters themselves ofYakshas. What wilt thou do with Sitā?\" Then thatexceedingly powerful ranger of the night was speedily raisedup and taken (back) to his residence. On the Ten-neckedone having departed, the Rākshasis of fearful facesfell to railing at Sitā in cruel and rough words,—ButJānaki heeded their speech as a straw; and their fury waslost upon Sitā. Desisting from their unavailing railing, theflesh-feasting Rākshasis imparted unto Rāvana the mightyintent of Sitā. Then, they all failing in their hope anddeprived of energy, and tired, came under the sway of sleep.And on their sleeping, Sitā intent on the welfare of her lord,lamenting piteously, in forlorn guise, and striken withextreme sorrow, mourned profusely. Then sitting up in theirmidst, Trijatā spoke,—\"Do ye without delay fall to your ownselves; but never (eat up) the dark-eyed Sitā, the chastedaughter unto Janaka and the daughter-in-law of Daçaratha.In truth I have seen a dismal dream capable of making one'shair stand on end; (presaging) destruction unto Rākshasasand victory unto the husband of this one. For protectingus, Rākshasis from Rāghava, let us solicit Vaidehi. Eventhis is relished by me. If we relate such a dream unto theaggrieved one, she, being freed from her diverse woes, shallattain the height of joy. Propitiated by our bowing down,Janaka's daughter, Maithili, shall rescue the Rākshasis froma mighty fear.\" Thereat, that bashful maiden, rejoiced atthe prospect of her husband's victory, said,—'If all this provetrue, then for certain, (ye shall) meet with succour at myhands. Witnessing such a hard condition of Sitā I beganto reflect; nor did my my mind attain ease or freedom fromthought. And I cast about for finding means of addressingJānaki. And I began by extolling the Ikshwāku race.Hearing the words that I uttered, embellished withdescriptions of the virtues of Rājarshis, that exalted ladyreplied with her eyes covered with tears. \"Who art thou?And how hast thou, O foremost of monkeys, found thy wayhere? And what is thy delight in Rāma? This it behoveththee to relate unto me.\" Hearing her speech, I too said,—'O revered one, thy husband, Rāma, hath found ahelp-mate in a one endowed with terrific strength, named Sugriva—redoubtable, the highly powerful lord of the monkeys.Do thou know me as Hanumān his servant, despatched hereby thy spouse—Rāma of unwearied actions. O famed damsel,that highly effulgent son of Daçaratha—the foremost of men,hath sent as a token this ring. I desire to know, O worshipfuldame, what behest of thine may I obey now. Shall I carry theeto Rāma and Lakshmana on the northern shore of the Ocean?\"Hearing this and revolving within herself Sitā, Janaka'sdaughter, replied—\"Discomfitting Rāvana, may Rāghavahimself carry me hence.' And bowing my head unto thatworshipful and blameless dame, I wanted of her a token as mightconduce to Rāghava's pleasure. Whereto replied Sitā—'O thouof mighty-arms do thou take this excellent jewel for which thoushalt be highly regarded by Rāma'. Having said this that bestof fair ones gave me the excellent jewel, and wrought upwith anxiety, related unto me the story of crow (for Rāma'sinformation). Thereupon bent on returning here, I, witha fixed mind, circumambulated and bowed unto thatworshipful dame. And revolving within herself she again replied—'Hanumān, do thou relate this unto Rāghava in such a wisethat the heroes Rāma and Lakshmana, along with Sugrivamight instantly come here. Or else there remain twomonths more of my life. Rāghava shall not see me and Ishall quit my life like one having no husband. Hearing thosepiteous accents I was worked up with ire and at once resolvedupon destroying the city of Lankā. Thereupon my bodyincreased like unto a mountain and desirous of entering intoconflict I began to lay waste the forest. The whole forestwas devastated—the birds and deer strayed away in fear andthe Rākshasees, having terrible faces, awaking, beheld allthat. And beholding me in the forest, they all, gathering,instantly conveyed the message unto Rāvana. O King, Othou of mighty prowess, this thy forest and castle has beenbroken down by the vicious-souled monkey not knowing thystrength. O King, he has been impelled by his vicioussense, to do thy mischief. Do thou order for his head sothat he might not return. Hearing this the lord of theRākshasas despatched a chosen band of demons namedKinkaras.426 I despatched with my mace in no time eightythousand of them no sooner than they entered the forestwith darts and maces. And the few, who were saved,proceeded very quickly unto Rāvana and related unto himthe destruction of the soldiers by me. Thereupon I thoughtof destroying the Chaitya427 palace and destroyed with thepillar all the Rākshasas stationed there. Excited with wrathI destroyed that palace; the best in the whole city of Lankā.Thereupon (Rāvana) despatched Jambhumāli, the son ofPrahasta. With my fierce mace I destroyed that mightyRākshasa, versed in the art of war, along with his retinue andsurrounded by a band of terrible and grim-visaged demons.Hearing this, Rāvana, the lord of Rākshasas sent the highlypowerful sons of the ministers followed by a regiment ofinfantry. But I despatched them to the abode of Death bymeans of my dart. And hearing of the destruction in battleof the ministers' sons of feeble prowess Rāvana sent fiveheroic commanders. But I slew all of them along withtheir hosts. Thereupon the Ten necked demon sent hishighly powerful son Aksha in the battle followed by anumber of Rākshasas. No sooner the princely son ofMandodari, versed in the art of war, rose high up in thewelkin than I got hold of his legs and whirling him forhundred times ground him to the dust. And hearing of thediscomfiture of Aksha, Rāvana, exercised with ire, sent hissecond son, the highly powerful Indrajit incapable of beingrepressed in battle. And discomfitting that best ofRākshasas with his host I attained to an excess of delight.That hero of great prowess and mighty-arms with a numberof other proud heroes was despatched by Rāvana in greatconfidence. And beholding my unbearable prowess andhis own soldiers slain, speedily he went away fettering mewith his Brahmā weapon. Thereat the other Rākshasasbound me up with a rope and carried me to Rāvana. Andthereupon I was welcomed by the vicious-souled Rāvanaand was asked why I did come to Lankā and slay theRākshasas. Whereto I replied,—\"I have done all this forSitā. To behold her I have come here, O hero. I am themonkey Hanumān, the own begotten son of Maruta. Dothou know me as Rāma's ambassador and the minister ofSugriva. And on Rāma's embassy have I come here beforethee. Do thou hear of my mission—I do relate unto thee,O lord of Rākshasas, the message which the monkey chiefhath commanded me to communicate unto thee. O great hero,Sugriva hath asked of thy welfare and hath desired me tocommunicate unto thee these well meaning words, conducingto the acquirement of piety, wealth and desires. While Ilived on the mount Rishyamuka covered with huge treesI made friends with Rāghava dreadful in conflict. He hathspoken to me, O king, 'My spouse hath been taken away bya Rākshasa. It behoveth thee to promise me thy help in this.'And in the presence of fire, Rāma, along with Lakshmana,contracted friendship with me who had been deprived of hiskingdom by Vāli. And he hath made me lord over all themonkeys after slaying Vāli in conflict with a single shaft.It therefore behoveth us to assist him by all means. Andby virtue of this contract I have despatched Hanumān untothee as an envoy. Do thou therefore speedily bring backSitā and return her unto Rāghava before the heroic monkeysdiscomfit thee. Who knoweth not the prowess of themonkeys who in the days of yore used to visit the celestialsinvited?' With these words the king of the monkeys hathdespatched me unto thee. And thereupon he eyed me as ifburning me with the looks of his angry eyes. And thevicious-souled demon—Rāvana, of terrible deeds, orderedfor my destruction, not knowing my prowess. ThereuponBivishana, the high-souled brother of that lord of theRākshasas interceded on my behalf in the following strain—'O thou foremost of the Rākshasas, do thou alter thyresolution. The way, thou art following, is beyond the paleof royal policy. The destruction of an envoy is notsanctioned by the royal morality, O Rākshasa. Theycommunicate simply the mandate of their masters. O thouof incomparable prowess, there is no sanction for thedestruction of a messenger albeit he perpetrateth a mighty iniquity.Sometimes they have however been disfigured.\" Being thusaccosted by Bivishana, Rāvana ordered all the demons,saying \"Burn down this monkey's tail.' Hearing his mandate,the Rākshasas, of well-protected armour and terrible prowess,enveloped my tail with the fibres of cotton, silk and jute.And then striking me with their clenched fists they put fireto my tail. Although bound and fettered with many ropesI did not feel the least anguish for I was very much anxiousto behold the city during the day. And thereupon fetteringme and putting fire to my tail and announcing me in the publicstreets those heroic Rākshasas got at the city gate. Andthereupon contracting again my huge person and relievingmyself of the fetters I stood again in my pristine state.And taking up iron darts I slew all the Rākshasas there.And leaping over with great velocity the city gate, I, withmy burning tail, burnt down the whole city from the palaceto its outer gate like unto the fire of dissolution devastatingthe entire creation. And I was not the least flurried at it.'Forsooth hath Jānaki been destroyed—for behold I nothingin Lankā which hath not been burnt down—indeed thewhole city hath been reduced to ashes. For certain have Iburnt down Sitā while burning the city Lankā—and I havethus baffled the great work of Rāma.' While I was reflectingthus, being overwhelmed with grief, I heard the auspiciousaccents of the Charanas, exciting my wonder, 'Jānaki hathnot been burnt down.' Hearing those wonderful words Iregained my sense. I was then convinced by an auspicioussign that Jānaki  was not burnt down, for I was notreduced to ashes albeit my tail was burning. My heart wasexcited with joy and the wind spread its delicious fragrance.And by virtue of those manifest omens, by my confidence inthe prowess of Rāma; and Sitā, and the voice of ascetics, Iwas greately delighted at heart. And beholding Vaidehi again,I left her. And thereupon ascending the mount Aristha Ibegan to leap, desirous of beholding you. And followingthe track of the Wind, the Sun, the Moon, Gandharbas,and Siddhas I have beheld you all. By virtue of Rāma'sgrace and your prowess I have satisfied the charge ofSugriva. I have thus related unto you, what I hadperformed in Lankā, and it now remains with you to fulfillthe rest.\""

  "Āranya, Kishkindhā, and Sundara Kāndam": "Having related all, Hanumān, the Wind-god's sonbegan again, saying—\"Fruitful is Rāghava's endeavour andSugriva's energy—for greatly pleased have I been withSitā's conduct. O heroic monkeys, Sitā hath been keepingthe life of a highly chaste damsel. She can maintain theanimated creation by virtue of her asceticism and burn itwith her ire. Rāvana, the lord of the Rākshasas is alsohighly advanced in asceticism by virtue whereof he hathnot been ruined albeit he hath touched Sitā's person. Eventhe flame of fire cannot do, although touched by the hands,what Janaka's daughter can bring about by her ire. I haverelated unto you what had happened. It now behoveth usto behold Vaidehi along with those two sons of a king, aftercommanding all the monkeys headed by Jambavān andothers. I am alone capable of destroying the city of Lankāalong with the Rākshasas and their lord—Rāvana. Whatmore can I achieve if I am accompanied by the heroicmonkeys like ye, powerful, having control over their ownminds, well-armed, able and desirous of winning victory!I shall slay Rāvana in conflict along with his sons, brothersarmy and retinue. I shall destroy all the Rākshasas andbaffle all the weapons of Indrajit conferred on him byBrahmā, Rudra, Wind and Varuna albeit they are invisiblein battle. Without your permission my prowess hath beenbrought to a stand still. Hills and mountains, uprooted anddischarged by me continually, can destroy even the celestials,what of those night-rangers? Even if the ocean overflowethits banks, the Mount Māndara moveth off its place, theenemy's host cannot frighten Jambavān in conflict. Andspecially the heroic monkey, Vāli's son, is alone capable ofdestroying the whole host of the Rākshasas. Even themount Mandara is weakened by the velocity of the thighsof the high-souled monkey Neela—what of the Rākshasasin conflict? What hero is there amongst the celestials,Asuras, Yakshas, Gandharbas, serpents and birds who canequal Manida or Divida in battle? I do not find anyone who can oppose in the battle field the two bestmonkeys, the sons of Asvi gifted with great velocity. Byme alone hath the city Lankā been devastated burntdown and reduced to ashes. And I had announced inthe public streets there—\"May victory crown the highlypowerful Rām and Lakshmana, and may the king Sugrivaadvance in prosperity being protected by Rāghava. I am theservant of the king of Koçala, the own begotten son of theWind-God and my name is Hanumān. I have announced thuseverywhere. (And I beheld there) in the Açoka forest of thevicious-souled Rāvana, at the foot of a Sinçapā tree, thechaste Sitā waiting very poorly. She was encircled by theRākshasees, worn out with grief and anxiety and was likeunto the rays of the Moon shorn of their brilliance beingenveloped with clouds. And Vaidehi, having a beautifulwaist and devoted unto her husband, did not care for Rāvanaproud of his prowess and was accordingly confined by him.And that graceful daughter of the king of Videha was byall means devoted unto her lord and had all her thoughtscentered in him like unto Poulomi428 devoted unto her lordPurandara. And I saw her in that garden, wearing a singlepiece of cloth soiled with dirt, surrounded by the Rākshaseesand remonstrated with now and then by those uglydemons. Having a single braid of hair, poorly, engaged inthoughts touching her lord, she was lying on the earthshorn of all grace like unto a lotus on the appearance ofthe winter. She had not the least attachment for Rāvanaand was resolved upon putting an end to her existence.And somehow creating her confidence I addressed thatdamsel having the eyes of a fawn and related unto her thewhole story. And hearing of the friendship between Rāmaand Sugriva she attained to an excess of delight. She iswell-behaved and devoted unto her lord par excellence and blessedis the high-souled and ten-necked demon that she hath notdestroyed him (yet). And Rāma shall become an instrumentonly in bringing about his destruction. She hath really beengreatly reduced and worn out by the separation of her lord.Her person hath been shattered like unto learning waningby its prosecution on the first day of a lunar fortnight.Thus liveth there the great Sitā worn out with grief. Doye now perform what you think proper.\""

  "Āranya, Kishkindhā, and Sundara Kāndam": "Hearing his words, Vāli's son Angada spoke, saying,—\"These two monkeys, the sons of Asvi, are very powerfuland gifted with great velocity and are specially proud inconsequence of the boon conferred on them by the GreatGrand-father. Formerly to honor Asvi the Grand-father, ofall the worlds, made these two monkeys incapable of beingslain by any. And crushing the mighty host of the celestials,these two heroes gifted with great prowess, and maddenedwith haughtiness in consequence of the boon, drank upnectar. And these two, if worked up with ire, are capableof destroying the whole city of Lankā with her horses,chariots and elephants. What of other monkeys, I, myself,am capable of destroying soon the city along with theRākshasas and the mighty Rāvana! And there is not theleast wonder about it if I am aided by powerful monkeyheroes like you, having control over themselves, well armed,capable and desirous of winning victory. I have heard,that, by Wind-god's son alone Lankā was burnt. Ye are allfamed for your manliness, it doth not behove you to speakbefore Rāma. 'We have seen the worshipful dame buthave not been able to bring her.' Ye foremost of monkeys,there is none amongst the celestials or Aauras who can equalyou either in leaping or in prowess. And therefore winningLankā, slaying Rāvana along with his Rākshasa host inconflict and taking Sitā, let us go, delighted and having ourends accomplished. What else is there for us to performthan bringing the daughter of the king Janaka when theRākshasa crew shall be slain by Hanumān? And we shallplace Janaka's daughter between Rāma and Lakshmana.What is the use of putting the other residents of Kishkindainto trouble? It therefore behoveth us alone to go to Lankāand after slaying the best of the Rākshasas, to see Sugriva,Rāma and Lakshmana.\" Thereupon Jambavāna, theforemost of the monkeys, greatly delighted spoke untoAngada, who was thus resolved, the following pregnant words,—\"O great monkey, O thou of best understanding, whatthou hast spoken, is, (I think) not proper, for we have beendespatched by them to ransack the southern quarter, butwe have not been commanded by the king of the monkeysand the highly intelligent Rāma to bring her. And it shallnot please him even if we rescue her. And mentioning hisown lineage, that best of the kings, Rāghava, promisedbefore all the leading monkeys, that he would himselfrescue Sitā. How would he now falsify his own saying?What is the use of undertaking this work for nothing whichshall not conduce to his pleasure? And useless shall bethe display of your prowess, O ye, foremost of the monkeys.Let us therefore proceed where Rāma with Lakshmana, andthe highly effulgent Sugriva is, and relate unto them ourproposed work. What thou hast judged, O prince, is likedby us. And still you should look to Rāma's resolution andbring about his end."

And these leading monkeys headed by theWind-god's son proceeded leaping from the summit of the MountMahendra. And these highly powerful ones, having hugepersons, resembling the Mount Mandara, covered the welkinas if like so many mad elephants. They carried, as it werewith their own looks, the highly powerful Hanumān, giftedwith great velocity, having control over his own self, andadored by the Siddhas. They were resolved uponsatisfying Rāma's end and acquiring glory for themselves. Theirdesires were satisfied and mind elevated in consequence oftheir beholding Sitā and burning down Lankā. All of themwere anxious to communicate this pleasant news, to enterinto conflict and were resolved upon bringing about Rāma'swellbeing. And leaping and ascending the sky they got atthe Madhuvana,429 preserved by Sugriva, resembling thecelestial garden, covered with many trees, picturesque andincapable of being devastated by any. And themonkey-chief Sugriva's maternal uncle, the heroic and high-souledDadhimukha always guardeth that picturesque and spaciousgarden of the lord of monkeys. They were greatly workedup with anxiety. And beholding thdt large orchard, thoseyellow-coIouted monkeys were greatly delighted andbegged honey of the prince: And the prince respectfullyallowed these elderly monkeys headed by Jambavān todrink honey. And being thus commanded by the intelligentprince—Vāli's son, those monkeys ascended the treesinfested with bees and feasting on fragrant fruits and roots,were greatly delighted and intoxicated. And thereupon thosemonkeys, beside themselves with joy for being allowed todrink honey began to dance hither and thither. Some sang,some laughed, some danced, some bowed down, some read,some walked hither and thither, some leaped and sometalked at random. Some sprang upon one another, somequarrelled with one another, some leaped from one treeto another, and some jumped down on the earth fromthe tops of the trees. Some rose up with great velocity fromthe earth to the tops of the huge trees—some sang, othersapproached them laughing—some wept and othersapproached them weeping. Some were stricking with their nailsand others struck them in return. And thus the entire monkeyhost were bewildered with intoxication. There was noneamongst them who was not drunk and none who was notexcited with pride. Thereupon beholding all the fruitseaten up and the trees divested of leaves and flowers, themonkey Dadhimukha was worked up with ire and attemptedto prevent them. And that heroic, elderly monkey, theguard of the garden, was in return remonstrated with bythem who were greatly intoxicated. Thereat the highlyspirited monkey again made up his mind to protect thegarden from their devastations. He used harsh words,undauntedly towards some, struck the weak with his palm,quarrelled with some, and consoled others with soothingwords. They were greatly excited with drink, and beingprevented forcibly by Dadhimukha, they giving up all fear,began to pull him. And striking him with their nails, bitinghim with teeth, crushing him with their palms and feet, they,being drunk, almost reduced him to death and devastatedthe mangoe forest."

I shall myself thwart them who will obstructyou.\" Hearing his words, Angada, the best of the monkeys,delighted, said—'Drink honey, O monkeys, we must followHanumān's advice, who hath already been crowned withsuccess. We must follow him even if he leadeth us to anunworthy action, what of this which is most becoming?\"Hearing these words from Angada, the leading monkeysattained to an excess of delight and eulogized him again andagain. And adoring Angada—their prince, those monkeysproceeded by the way leading to the Madhuvana like untotrees carried by a stream. And entering that orchard theyforcibly attacked the waiters there. Hanumān saw Maithilee,and others heard of her from him—and those monkeys,renouncing all fear in consequence and obtaining permission,drank honey and feasted on various sweet fruits. And they,given to the drinking of honey, attacking the guards whowere approaching by hundreds, gave them a sound beating.Some monkeys,collecting honey with their hands measuring aDrona,430 drank it; others collecting themselves delightedlyinto a band spoiled it; while other yellow-coloured monkeysdrank and sprinkled it. And some, being beside themselveswith intoxication, struck others with the remaining quantity,while others waited at the foot of the trees, holding theirboughs. And some, being exhausted with drinking, spreadleaves and laid themselves thereon—and some being drunkand delighted struck others down in mad fury. And somelost their steps. Some roared and some delightedly set upthe music of the birds. Some of the monkeys, inebriete withhoney, slept on the earth; some laughed at othersimpudently and some cried aloud. Some spoke contraryto what they had done—and others put a differentconstruction thereon. And all the waiters of the gardenand the servants of Dadhimukha, were repressed by thoseterrible monkeys with censure and thrown up in the sky bytheir knee-joints. And terrified, they fled to differentdirections. And being worked up with anxiety, theyapproached Dadhimukha and said—'Commanded by Hanumānthe monkeys have forcibly devastated the Madhuvana andwe were thrown high up by them in the sky.\" Hearing ofthe destruction of the orchard, Dadhimukha, being greatlyenraged, consoled all the monkeys. \"Proceed ye before,I shall soon follow you and repress by force all thosemonkeys, greatly excited with pride and the drinking of theexcellent honey.\" Hearing these words from Dadhimukhathose leading and heroic monkeys proceeded with him towardsMadhuvana. And Dadhimukha proceeded with great velocityin their midst taking up a huge tree in his hand. And allhis attendants, taking trees, mountain crags, proceeded,wroth, where those leading monkeys were. And biting theirlips in wrath and remonstrating with them again and again,those monkeys began to suppress them by force. Andbeholding Dadhimukha greatly enraged, all the monkeys,headed by Hanumān, approached him with great vehemence.And as the mighty Dadhimukha of huge arms, was proceedingtowards them vehemently with a huge tree, Angada, wroth,caught him by the hand. He was beside himself withintoxication and therefore did not show him the least mercy,albeit he (Dadhimukha) was worshipful unto him. Andaccordingly with great vehemence he ground him to the dust.His arms and thighs were broken and his countenance wasdisfigured and that great heroe, the foremost of the monkeys,bathed in a pool of blood, remained senseless for sometime.And thereupon releasing himself from them by some devicethat leading monkey, proceeded to a nook, and addressed hisattendants, saying—\"Let us all proceed there where ourlord, the spacious-necked Sugriva liveth with Rāma. I shallrelate unto him all the unfair dealings of Angadaand forsooth shall that wrathful king punish all thesemonkeys. The picturesque Madhuvana is the most favouriteorchard of the high-souled Sugriva. It was enjoyed by hisforefathers and is not even approached by the celestials.And meting out punishment unto these monkeys, eager todrink honey and almost half dead, Sugriva shall slay themas well as their friends and relatives. Those vicious-souledones are worthy of being slain since they have transgressedthe royal mandate. And then shall my wrath, arisingout of impatience, bear fruits.\" Having thus spoken untothe guards of the forest the highly powerful Dadhimukhaleaped high up in the welkin and went away with them.And in no time he reached where the highly intelligentmonkey Sugriva, the offspring of the sun, was. Andbeholding Rāma, Lakshmana, and Sugriva and the levelground he descended from the sky. And descending fromthe sky that great and heroic Dadhimukha, lord over all themonkeys engaged in protecting the forest, placing his foldedpalms on his forehead and with a poorly countenance, laidlow his crown at Sugriva's feet."

I declare thou hast no fear, speak out the truth,From whose fear hast thou come here? It behoveththee to suggest the becoming proceedure. Is it all wellwith my orchard Madhuvana? I long to knoweverything, O monkey.\" Being thus addressed hopefully bythe high-souled Sugriva, Dadhimukha, gifted with anintelligence of a very high order, rose up and spoke—\"Neitherthyself, nor Vāli, the lord of the monkeys, O king, allowedthat orchard to be freely used by the monkeys—but thathath been now laid waste by them. I prevented themalong with these attendants, but disregarding me, they drankand feasted there at their pleasure. They were prevented,O lord, in their act of devastation, by these guards, but thosemonkeys, without caring for me the least, feasted there.Some of them went beyond the pale of good conduct, othersate at their pleasure, and all frowned (at us). And whenthese attendents, being insulted by them, were greatlywroth, they were driven out of the garden, by those powerfuland enraged monkeys. And they were greatly assailed bythose many thousand heroic monkeys, worked up with ireand having reddened eyes. Some had their arms broken,some had their knee-joints crushed and some of them werethrown up in the sky. Thyself their lord living, theseheroes are beaten, and the entire Madhuvana is being freelyenjoyed by them.\" The highly intelligent Lakshmana,the slayer of foes, addressed Sugriva, the foremostof the monkeys, while he was thus being informed,saying,—\"O king, why hath this monkey, the guard overthe forest, come to thee, and what sorrow hath led him togive vent to these expressions?\" Being thus addressed by thehigh-souled Lakshmana, Sugriva, skilled in the art of speech,replied,—\"O worshipful Lakshmana, the heroic monkeyDadhimukha speaks that the war-like monkeys headed byAngada have drunk honey. They would not have engaged insuch an unfair proceeding had they been unsuccessful intheir mission. They have surely achieved success while theyhave thus been bent upon devastating the orchard. For thisthe warders were struck on their knee-joints for obstructingtheir revelry and for this they went so far as to disregardthe powerful monkey Dadhimukha. I myself appointedthis monkey the lord of my orchard. Forsooth hathHanumān espied the worshipful Sitā and none else. Thereis none else but Hanumān who is the instrumental ofthis work, for that best of monkeys hath in hima high intellect, knoweth the art of success, is giftedwith courage, strength and prowess and is conversantwith Sastras. That work is sure to succeed whose leadingspirits are the mighty Jambavāna and Angada, and worker isHanumān. Forsooth that orchard hath been laid waste by theseheroes headed by Angada. And ransacking the southernquarter, those leading monkeys have come back anddelightedly entered the Madhuvana. And the whole orchard hasbeen explored and enjoyed by those monkeys and theattendants beaten and wounded on their knee-joints. Tocommunicate unto me this intelligence, this monkey of knownprowess, and sweet accents, named Dhadimukha, hath comehere. O thou of mighty arms, O son of Sumitrā, forsooththey have beheld Sitā, since the monkeys, just on their return,have engaged in drinking honey. O best of men, they are allwell-known monkeys and without espying Vaidehi they wouldnot have engaged in the destruction of that orchardconferred on us as a gift by the celestials.\" Hearing these wordsfrom Sugriva, pleasant unto ears, the virtuous-souledLakshmana along with Rāghava, was greatly pleased. And hearingthis from Dadhimukha, Sugriva, greatly gratified, addressedthat lord of the forest, again, saying,—\"Greatly pleased I am,since, they, being successful, have explored this forest. Andthe insulting procedure of the successful is also pardonable.Do thou soon go there and protect that orchard, and sendhere all those monkeys headed by Hanumān. Along withthese two descendants of Raghu, I long to know soonfrom these monkeys headed by Hanumān, and proud likelions, what they have settled for the regaining of Sitā. Andbeholding these two princes greatly delighted and their eyesexpanded with joy, the king of the monkeys, thought thatthe accomplishment of the great wort was near at hand, andwas accordingly greatly delighted."

He went away with the same speed with which hecame and leaping down on the earth from the sky, enteredthe orchard. And entering that forest he beheld all the leadersof the monkeys spending the hours delightedly, having passedurine, the outcome of honey. And approaching them, theheroe, with folded hands and delighted, addressed Angada,with the following words—\"O gentle one, do thou not takeoffence, for these monkeys, protecting the garden enraged,unweetingly prevented thee. O thou of great strength, thouart worn out with thy long journey, do thou drink thy ownhoney, thou art our prince and the master of this garden.It behoveth thee to forgive us for our wrath arising out ofignorance. Like unto thy sire before, thyself and Sugrivaare the lords of these monkey hosts, O thou foremost ofthem, and none else. O innocent prince, I have related allabout this unto thy uncle. When I described unto him, thearrival of all these forest rangers, as well as of thineaccompanied by them, and the destruction of this garden byyou all, he was not the least offended, rather delighted.And worked up with joy thy uncle Sugriva, the lord of earthand monkeys, said \"Send them all here speedily.\" Hearingthose words from Dadhimukha, Angada, the foremost of themonkeys and skilled in speech, addressed them all, saying—\"Oye leaders of the monkey hosts, I fear, Rāma hath heard allabout this. Dadhimukha relates everything joyfully and henceI infer this. And our work finished, O slayer of foes, it dothnot behove us to remain here (any longer). You have alldrunk honey at your pleasure and there is nothing left andyou should now go where the monkey king Sugriva is. Oleading monkeys, I shall follow what you will in a banddesire me to do. In actions I am surbordinate unto you all.I am not justified to command although I am a prince. Youare all of accomplished actions, it is not proper to repressyou forcibly. \" Hearing those sweet words of the princeAngada, the monkeys delightedly replied, saying—\"O king,O foremost of monkeys, who else can speak thus being amaster? Any one else, we think, is proud of his wealth.Such like words become thee only and none else. Thyhumility speaks of thy future greatness. We are all anxiousto go there, where Sugriva, the king of the monkeys, is.Verily we speak unto thee, O foremost of monkeys, thatwithout thy permission, none amongst us, is capable ofadvancing a single step.\" They addressing him thus, Angadareplied—\"All right, let us all go.\" Saying this he leapedup in the sky and was followed by all those monkeys,clouding the welkin as if with stones thrown up by a tool.And placing before them Angada and Hanumān, themonkeys leaping vehemently up in the sky roared like untoclouds driven by the wind. And Angada nearing, Sugriva,the lord of the monkeys, spoke unto the lotus-eyed Rāma,stricken with grief, saying—\"May good betide thee. Dothou console thyself. The worshipful dame has been foundout; there is not the least doubt about it. Or else theywould not have come as the time is already past. I (furthermore) infer this from Angada's joy, O thou of auspiciouspresence. Without being successful in his mission, thelarge-armed prince, Angada, the foremost of the monkeys,would not have come to me. If the monkeys had engagedin such an unfair proceeding without being successfulin their mission, Angada would have looked poorly and hismind would have been over-whelmed with grief andforgetfulness. And without beholding the daughter of theking Janaka they would not have dared to destroyMadhuvana obtained and preserved by my forefathers. Do thouconsole thyself, O Rāma, by whom Kauçalyā hath becomethe mother of a good son. O thou, rigidly observing anyreligious vow or obligation, forsooth hath Hanumān beheldthe worshipful dame and none else. No other wight is soqualified an instrument in encompassing this end. O thouof excellent intellect, Hanumān knoweth the art of success,is gifted with intellect, perseverance and courage and isversed in Sastras. That work cannot fail, which is workedout by Jambavān and Angada and presided over byHanumān. Be not laden with anxiety, O thou of unmitigatedprowess. These monkeys have come here excited withpride and drink. They would not have come with such agrandeur had they been but unsuccessful. From theirbreaking down the orchard and drinking honey I inferredso. Thereupon he heard in the sky the joyous sounds of themonkeys proud on account of Hanumān's work, proceedingtowards Kishkindhā and as if announcing their success.Thereupon hearing the noise of these monkeys, Sugriva,their chief, being greatly delighted, uplifted his tail. Andplacing Angada and Hanumān before them those monkeysproceeded to behold Rāma. And those heroes headed byAngada, delighted and intoxicated, descended before Rāghavaand the lord of the monkeys. And the mighty-armedHanumān, lowering his head, related unto Rāghava, Sitā'sspiritual and physical well-being. And hearing fromHanumān the sweet words that he had beheld Sitā, Rāmaand Lakshmana were greatly delighted. And beingconfirmed thus by the Wind-god's son, Lakshmana, greatlypleased, respectfully looked towards Sugriva.

And they described unto Rāma,the confinement of Sitā in Rāvana's seraglio, the remonstrancesof the she-demons, her unflinching attachment in her lordand the time appointed (by the Rākshasa for her destruction).And hearing of Vaidehi's well-being Rāma said—\"O monkeyswhere liveth the worshipful Sitā? And how is her attachmentunto me? Do ye relate everything unto me.\" Hearing thosepainful words of Rāma, the monkeys desired Hanumān,conversant with the whereabouts of Sitā, to describe everything unto him. Hearing their words, Hanumān, theWind-god's son, versed in the art of speech, lowering his head inSitā's name and towards the southern direction (where sheliveth) began to relate how he succeeded in beholding Sitā.And conferring on (Rāma) the heavenly jewel set on a goldenleaf and burning with its own effulgence, Hanumān, withfolded hands, began—\"Anxious to behold Sitā, the daughterof the king Janaka, I, ploughing over the main extending overa hundred yojana, wended my way and by and by reachedLankā, the capital of the vicious-souled Rāvana. Lankā issituated on the southern bank of the southern occean. AndI saw there Sitā, in the inner appartment of Rāvana.Centering all her thoughts in thee, breathes that damsel, ORāma. I saw her reviled by the she demons again andagain. She is being guarded in that garden by thegrim-visaged Rākshasees. And that worshipful dame, O hero, everused to happiness, is now stricken with grief in thy absence.Confined in Rāvana's inner apartment, well protectedby those she-demons, wearing a single braid of hair andpoorly, she is engaged only in thoughts touching thee. Shein lying on earth, shorn of all grace like unto a lotus on theappearance of the winter. She hath not the least attachmentfor Rāvana and is resolved upon putting an end to herexistence. O Kākutstha, O innocent prince, after enquiringfor sometime, I found that worshipful dame devoted untothee, and narrating the glories of the Ikshwāku race, Oforemost of men, I created her confidence by and by, andaddressing her I related everything. And hearing of thefriendship between thee and Sugriva she was greatlydelighted. And she has her respect for thee unshaken andall her actions are for thee. O great man, O thou best ofmen, I beheld the daughter of Janaka in this plight, engagedin hard austerities and ever devoted unto thee. O thou ofgreat intelligence, O Rāghava, offering me (this jewel) as atoken, she wanted me to relate unto thee, the occurrence atthe mount chitrakuta regarding the crow. And Jānakiaddressing me said—'O Wind-god's son, do thou describeeverything of what thou hast seen here, unto Rāma. Andrelating everything before Sugriva, do thou present him withthis jewel which has been preserved by me with great care.I have kept with great care this excellent jewel of greateffulgence. Do thou remind him of the mark which he madeon my forehead with red arsenic. O innocent monkey,greatly delighted am I on beholding the brilliant jewelwhich he has sent through thee. Breathe shall I onlyfor a month, beyond that I shall never live, subject asI am to the demons.' Thus was I accosted by Sitā, reducedto a skeleton, observing pious observances, shut up in Rāvana'sinner apartment and having eyes like those of a hind. Ihave described unto thee everything, O Rāghava, do thoumake arrangements for bridging over the ocean.\" Andconsidering those two princes greatly consoled, theWind-god's son handed over that token unto Rāghava anddescribed everything from the beginning to the end."

  "Āranya, Kishkindhā, and Sundara Kāndam": "Being thus addressed by the high-souled Rāghava,Hanumān, related unto him all of what Sitā had said,—\"Oforemost of men, the worshipful Jānaki, related as a token,all the incidents at the Mount Chitrakuta from thebeginning to the end. Sleeping happily with thee, Jānaki one dayawoke before, and in the meantime, a crow wounded herbreast with its beaks. O Rāma, thou wert then asleep onSitā's lap and that crow again afflicted the worshipful dame.And it again wounded her. And being bathed in blood andsuffering terrible pangs, that worshipful dame aroused thee.O slayer ol foes, O thou of mighty-arms, seeing her breastwounded, thou, wroth like a serpent, didst speak saying—'O timid damsel, who, with his nails, hath wounded thybreast? Who hath played with an angry serpent having fivefaces?' And casting thy looks around thou didst behold acrow facing the worshipful dame with sharpened nailsbesmeared with blood. That crow, the best of the birds, wasSakra's son. And it entered speedily into the earth withthe velocity of the wind. Thereupon, thy eyes rolling withire, thou, O mighty armed hero, O foremost of the intelligent,didst resolve to destroy that crow. And taking a kuça offthy seat thou didst set it on Brahma weapon. And it flamedlike unto the fire of dessolution before that crow. And thoudidst let off that burning kuça towards that bird. Andthereupon that burning kuça followed the crow. And being forsakeneven by the celestials, who were terrified, and ransackingthe three worlds it did not get a refuge. Thereupon it againcame to you, O subduer of foes. And seeking thy shelterit laid itself low on the ground. And O Kākutstha, thoudidst save it albeit it was worthy of being slain. Andthinking it improper to baffle the aim of the weapon, thoudidst, O Rāghava, destroy the right eye of the crow.Thereupon bowing unto thee and the king Daçaratha, that crow,bidding adieu, went to its quarter. O Rāghava, thou art theforemost of those skilled in the use of weapons, powerful andgifted with an excellent character, why dost thou notdischarge weapons towards the Rākshasas? Thecelestials, the Gandharvas, the Asuras, the Marutas—none ofthem is qualified, O Rāma, to equal thee in conflict. If thou,gifted with great prowess, hast any affection for me, do thouspeedily, with well-armed shafts, destroy Rāvana in conflict.And obtaining the behests of his brother, why doth notLakshmana, the subduer of foes and best of men, protect me,O Rāghava? Those two best of men, gifted with theeffulgence of Wind and Fire, and incapable of being repressedeven by the celestials, are disregarding me. Forsooth haveI perpetrated a mighty iniquity since those two slayers offoes, being capable, do not protect me.' Hearing thosesweet and piteous accents of Vaidehi I again spoke untothat worshipful dame, saying—'Forsooth can I swear by thee,O worshipful dame, that Rāma is sorely stricken with griefin thy absence. And Lakshmana too relenteth heavilybeholding him laden with sorrow. It doth not behove theeto relent any more as I have succeeded in finding thee out.Thou shalt at this very moment behold the end of thy grief.And those two princes, the foremost of men and slayers offoes, actuated with energy on hearing that I have seen thee,shall reduce Lankā to ashes. And slaying in conflict theterrible Rāvana, with his kith and kin, Rāghava, in sooth, Oexcellent damsel, shall take thee back to his own city. Othou of a blameless person, do thou confer on me such atoken, as might be recognized by Rāma and conduce to hispleasure.' Thereat, casting her looks around, she took outan excellent jewel from her cloth, worthy of being set on herbraid and conferred it on me, O thou of great strength.And O thou, the most favourite of the Raghu race, taking forthee that gem with my hands and bowing unto her, Iaddressed myself speedily for departure. And thereuponbeholding me ready to depart and increase in bulk andabout to leap up in the welkin, Sitā, the daughter of theking Janaka, poorly, bathed in tears, overwhelmed withsorrow and having her voice choked with grief, spake,saying—'Blessed art thou O great monkey, since thou shaltbehold the large-armed and the lotus-eyed Rāma and thehighly famed Lakshmana, my lord's younger brother.' Andbeing thus accosted by Maithili, I said—'Do thou speedilyplace thyself on my back, O worshipful dame, O thou thedaughter of king Janaka, and I shall soon show thee, O greatdame, O thou having dark blue eyes, thy lord along withSugriva and Lakshmana.' Whereto she replied—'This isnot the pious course, O great monkey, O thou the foremostof thy race, that I shall, of my own accord, place myself onthy back. And although before this I was touched by thedemon, O hero, it was because I could not help otherwisesubject as I was to circumstances. Do thou thyself repair,O foremost of monkeys, where those two princes are.'Addressing me with these words she again said—'O Hanumān, dothou relate my well-being unto Rāma and Lakshmana ofleonine prowess, and Sugriva accompanied by his followers.Do thou so describe as the large-armed Rāghava may saveme from this ocean of grief. Do thou narrate unto Rāma thismy terrible sorrow and the affliction by the she-demons. Maygood betide thee, on thy way, O foremost of the monkeys.'Thus the worshipful Sitā gave vent to these piteous accents.Hearing these words do thou believe that it is all well withher.\""

  "Āranya, Kishkindhā, and Sundara Kāndam": "Whereupon, O foremost of men, out of thy love andadoring me for thy friendship, that worshipful dame—addressed me again, saying—\"Do thou thus speak everything unto Rāma, the son of Daçaratha, so that he mightsoon take me hence, slaying Rāvana in battle. O heroe,O slayer of foes, if it pleaseth thee, thou mayst relieve thyselfof the toil by living in a secret nook and then proceedto-morrow. O monkey, in thy company, I do momentarilyforget the weight of my grief, unfortunate as I am. O thougifted with great prowess, thyself departing, I shall wait forthy return, but doubt I very much whether I shall live tillthen. Burnt I shall be with the fear of not beholding theeagain, wretched and striken with grief as I am. And so Ishall be, hereafter, overwhelmed with a mightier grief. Ohero, besides, I entertain a grave doubt about thy assistants,the monkeys and bears. I do not know how shall the host ofmonkeys and bears and those two princes cross over themighty main? O innocent monkey of all the creaturesthree only are qualified to cross over the ocean, thyself, Garudaand the Wind. O thou foremost of those skilled in speech,what hast thou settled about the accomplishment of this hardwork? True it is that thou art alone qualified to accomplishthis work, O thou the slayer of inimical heroes—but suchmanifestation of thy prowess shall increase thy glory only.But if Rāma, obtaining victory, can take me hence to hisown city, it shall redound to his glory. It doth not behovethe heroic Rāghava, to take me away by stealth, like untoRāvana capturing me from the forest under a disguise.Truly it shall be his becoming work, if Kākutstha, therepressor of enemy's host, can take me away, enveloping thecity Lankā with his army. Do thou therefore initiate thatwork as becometh that high-souled hero and may displayhis prowess.\" Hearing these sound reasonable and affectionatewords I gave her the last reply, saying—'O worshipful dame,Sugriva, the foremost of the monkeys, the lord of monkeyand bear hosts and gifted with manliness, hath resolved uponrescuing thee. He hath under his command a number ofmighty and courageous monkeys gifted with great prowessand quick-coursing like imagination. Their course is neverthwarted—whether going upwards or downwards—or movingtortuously. They are never exhausted in their actions—highly courageous and of measureless prowess. And thosegreat and powerful monkeys, coursing in the air, have againand again circumambulated the earth. Sugriva hath manymonkeys—my equal—and greater than I, but none of inferiorstrength. While I have crossed over the main—what ofthese mighty heroes? The leading heroes are never sent ona mission but only those of inferior merit. No more ofbewailing, O worshipful dame. Do thou remove thy grief.And with one leap these leaders of monkey-hosts shallreach Lankā. O great damsel, these two princes, placingthemselves on my back shall come to thee like unto therising Sun and Moon. Thou shalt soon behold beforeLankā's gate Rāghava the slayer of foes resembling a lionand Lakshmana with a bow in his hand. And thou shalt soonobserve in a band the heroic monkeys, gifted with the strengthof lions and tigers, and having nails and teeth for theirweapons. And thou shalt soon hear the roaring of the leadingmonkeys on the summit of mount Malaya, resemblingthe muttering of the clouds. And thou shalt soon beholdRāghava, the slayer of foes, installed along with thee on thethrone of Ayodhya after returning from the forest.\" And thatdaughter of the king of Mithilā although heavily laden withsorrow in thy absence was greatly comforted and pleased bymy auspicious words boding the fulfilment of her desire."

The typesetters of the original book represented the letter ā (with a macron above) as â (with circumflex above) when italicized, but this etext uses the macron throughout. Words in italics in this etext were italicized in the original book. I have corrected obvious misspellings but I've left variant spellings alone. Some words and names, like yojana and Gāruda, were spelled two different ways in the same text. I have spelled them consistently to avoid confusion."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Hearing the words of Hanumān rehearsed properly, Rāma, exceedingly delighted, said,—\"By Hanumān hath been performed a very great deed, rare on earth, and one incapable of being even conceived by any other in the world. Save Gāruda and the Wind-god, and save also Hanumān, him find I not who crosseth the wide ocean. Entering by main force the city of Lankā, incapable of being subjugated by the gods and Dānavas and Yakshas, the Gandharbas, serpents or Rakhas, and well protected by Rāvana,—who, living, cometh out (of it)? And who that is not the compeer of Hanumān in strength and prowess, even entereth into (Lankā), hard to subdue, and carefully guarded by the Rākshasas? And having so put forth his strength commensurate with his prowess, Hanumān hath also performed a great act befitting a servant on behalf of Sugriva.1 That servant who, being entrusted with a hard task,—after having accomplished it, doeth another work in pursuance of (the prescribed business), is the best of men. That servant is middling, who, deputed to any task,2 doth not, albeit capable, perform any other work which may be dear to the king. And that servant who, entrusted with any work the king, doth not, although competent, heedfully accomplish the same, hath been called the worst. Anent the order (which he had received), Hanumān hath done the work (and more). He hath not been humbled,3—and, further, hath pleased Sugriva. And by seeing Vaidehi, (Hanumān hath), while reaping righteousness, saved me, the Raghu race, and the highly powerful Lakshmana. And this pained my mind sore, that I cannot do a like benefit, returning this dear office of his. Embrace expresseth the all (of the Deity),4 and, finding this occasion, I extend my embrace unto the high-souled Hanumān\". Having said this, Rāma, with his down standing on end in joy, embraced the self-controlled Hanumān, who was present after having finished his speech. Then reflecting for a while, the best of the Raghus again spoke in the presence of Sugriva, lord of monkeys. \"Complete success hath been attained anent the search for Sitā. But when I think of the ocean, my mind is again sunk in dejection. How can the assembled monkeys go over to the southern shore of the vasty deep, difficult to cross? This tidings thou hast related unto me touching Vadehi, but what are the monkeys to do next about crossing the sea?\" Having said this unto Hanumān, that slayer of foes, mighty-armed Rāma, agitated by anxiety, was then plunged in thought."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Then the graceful Sugriva spake words capable of soothing sorrow, unto Daçaratha's son, Rāma, who was wrought up with grief,—\"Why, O hero, dost thou grieve, like one that is base? Let not this be so. Chase away thy grief, even as an ingrate resigneth amity. Nor, O Rāghava, when the whereabouts of Sitā hath been discovered, and when too the abode itself of the foe hath been known, do I perceive the reason of thy sorrow. Thou, O Rāghava, art intelligent, conversant with learning, wise, and judicious. Do thou cast away this sorry way of thinking, even as a self-controlled (ascetic) casteth away any course of thought interfering with the attainment of his purpose. Crossing over the ocean swarming with gigantic alligators, we shall enter Lankā and slay thy enemy. Of a person that is dispirited and poor in pluck and that hath his soul overwhelmed with grief, every interest droopeth, and he cometh by misfortunes (one after another). All these heroes, these leaders of monkey-hordes, who are ardent for thy welfare, are competent to enter into fire itself. From their cheerful attitude I know this, and firm is my faith. It behoveth thee so to arrange things that, slaying the foe, Rāvana of impious acts, we may bring hither Sitā by our own prowess. Do thou, O Rāghava, so order matters that a bridge may be constructed (over the main), and that we may behold the palace of the Rākshasa monarch. We having seen the city of Lankā, established on the summit of Trikuta, do thou for certain conclude Rāvana as slain in battle immediately after (we see her). Without throwing a bridge over the ocean—the dread abode of Varuna—even the Asuras and celestials with Indra (at their head) are unequal to subduing Lankā. When the bridge over the ocean hath been constructed up to near Lankā, and when my forces have crossed (over the sea), consider victory as secured. As these monkeys are heroic in fight, and able to wear forms at will, O king, do not let thy intellect get stupified and thus mar all interests. In this world, sorrow berefts people of their prowess. Do thou do even what should be done by a man—summon thy manliness; for what an actor doeth promptly, conduceth to his success. At this time, O eminently wise one, do thou realise goodness through thy energy.5 Of heroic, high-souled, men like thyself, on their sustaining an entire or a partial loss, grief undoeth every interest. Therefore, the foremost of intelligent persons, and conversant with every lore, thou shouldst along with councilors like me, strive to beat thy foe. Find I none in the three worlds, O Rāghava, who can stay in fight before thee equipped with thy bow. Thy business entrusted to these monkeys shall not (anyway) suffer. And soon, crossing over the boundless main, thou shalt behold Sitā. Therefore, O king, renounce thy sorrow, and call up wrath. Those Kshatriyas that conceive no anger in respect of their enemies, have their activity annulled; and all fear furious persons. Drawing nigh unto us, do thou, gifted with acute intelligence, cast about for crossing over the dreadful deep—lord of streams—along with us. On these forces getting beyond the ocean, do thou take it for certain that we have won; and when my whole host hath reached the further shore, do thou indubitably conclude that we have obtained victory. These monkeys, heroic and capable of assuming in fight forms at will, shall slaughter those foes by showering rocks and trees. If I see any means of crossing the ocean, Varuna's abode, I shall, O destroyer of foes, deem him as slain in battle. And what is the use of dilating? Every way thou shalt prove victorious. And I see omens, and my mind is filled with delight\"."

 {
  "Yuddhakāndam": "Hearing Sugriva's speech, reasonable and fraught with high sense, Kākutstha accorded his assent to it and spoke unto Hanumān, saying,—\"By asceticism, or constructing a a bridge, or drying up the ocean,—competent every way am I for crossing over this ocean. Of impracticable places, tell me how many there are in (Lankā), which are incapable of being come at. O monkey, as thou hast seen personally, I wish to get acquainted with all this. And thou hast at thy leisure duly noticed in Lankā the number of the army, the inaccessibility (or otherwise) of the gates, the defence of Lankā, and the dwellings of the Rākshasas. Do thou faithfully relate this unto me, for thou art observant\". Hearing Rāma's speech, Hanumān, offspring of the Wind-god, foremost of those conversant with speech, again spake unto Rāma,—\"Hearken! I will describe unto thee by what method is the city of Lankā guarded and protected by the Rākshasas, how loyal the Rākshasas are, the surpassing prosperity of Lankā, the dreadfulness of the deep, the divisions of the forces, and the number of the elephants, horses, cars, etc\". Having said this, that best of monkeys, knowing the nature of things, went on,—\"Lankā, filled with mad elephants, ever rejoiceth. She is great, thronging with cars and inhabited by Rākshasas. Her doors are firmly established and furnished with massy bolts. And she hath four wide and giant gates. (At those gates) are powerful and large arms, stones, and engines, whereby a hostile host approaching, is opposed. At the entrances are arrayed and set in order by bands of heroic Rākshasas, hundreds of dreadful sharp iron sataghnis.6 She hath a mighty impassable golden wall, having its side emblazoned in the centre with costly stones, coral, lapises and pearls. Round about is a moat, exceedingly dreadful, with cool water, eminently grand, fathomless, containing ferocious aquatic animals, and inhabited by fishes. At the gates are four broad bridges, furnished with machines and many rows of grand structures. On the approach of hostile forces, their attack is repulsed by these machines, and they are thrown into the ditch. One among these bridges is immovable, strong and fast established; adorned with golden pillars and daises. O Rāma, albeit Rāvana hungereth for fight, yet is he calm; and he is vigilant and ever engaged in superintending his army. And dreadful and resembling a celestial citadel, Lankā cannot be ascended by means of any support. She hath fortresses composed of streams, those of hills, and artificial ones of four kinds. And, O Rāghava, she is situated on the other shore of the ocean having its limit far away. And way there is none even for barks,—and all sides are destitute of division. And that citadel is built on the mountain's brow; and, resembling the metropolis of the immortals, the exceedingly invincible Lankā is filled with horses and elephants. And a moat and sataghnis and various engines adorn the city of Lankā, belonging to the wicked Rāvana. And an ayuta of Rākshasas, dart-handed, hard to subdue,—and all fighting at the front with their swords—protect the Eastern gate. And a niyuta of Rākshasas with a fourfold force, and with the flower of the soldiery—protect the Southern gate. And a prayuta of Rākshasas, bearing swords and shields, and skilled in all arms, protect the Western gate. And an arvuda of Rakhas protect the Northern gate. And car-warriors and horsemen—persons honored and sprung from noble lines—by hundreds and thousands,—and irrepressible goblins and kotis of Rākshasas, protect the garrison. I have broken down the bridges and filled up the entrenchment. I have burnt the city of Lankā and laid the wall low. Let us by any way whatever cross over Varuna's abode. Do thou take it for certain that the city of Lankā is subdued by the monkeys. What is the use of thy reckoning the rest? Angada, Dwivida, Mainda, Jāmbavān, Panasa, Nala, and the general, Nila, bounding and reaching Rāvana's abode, and riving the same consisting of woods and hills, moat and gateway, walls and dwellings, shall, O Rāghava, bring (hither) Sitā. If this be so,7 do thou order the entire body of the army to be brought; and do thou set out at the proper hour\"."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Hearing Hanumān's speech duly from the beginning, the exceedingly energetic Rāma having truth for his prowess, said,—\"What thou sayest—'I shall speedily destroy the city of this dreadful Raksha,'—is true, I tell thee. Therefore, at this very moment arrange for Sugriva's march. The Sun hath attained his meridian at this proper moment, capable of conferring victory.8 Let Rāvana carry away Sitā (to his own country),—whither shall Rāvana, living, repair? Like a dying person who hath taken a death-dispelling drug and drunk ambrosia, Sitā, hearing of my preparations for war, shall inspire hope of life. To-day the Northern Phālguni (is in the ascendant); and to-morrow the moon shall be in conjunction with Hasta.9 O Sugriva, shall we set out, surrounded by the entire host? The omens I witness, augur, that, having slain Rāvana, I shall bring back Jānaki. The upper lid of my eye throbbeth; and it betokeneth that my desire hath indeed been had\". Then, honored by the monkey-king as well as Lakshmana, the righteous Rāma, understanding the import of things, again said,—\"Surrounded by hundreds and thousands of fast-speeding monkeys, let Nila go ahead of this force, for surveying the route. O Nila, do thou, O general, expeditiously take the army by a path furnished with fruits and roots, having cool waters of the woods, and replenished with honey. The wicked Rākshasas vitiate10 fruits, roots and water along the way. Thou, ever on the alert, shouldst preserve these from the Rakshas. And, bounding down into hollow places, mountain-fastnesses, and woods, let the rangers of the wilds, spy the posted detachments of the enemy. Let those that are incompetent, stay here. This business is dreadful, and we should apply our best strength in conducting the same. Therefore let the foremost monkeys gifted with prodigious prowess lead forth the choice portion of the army, numbering hundreds and thousands. And let Gaja resembling a hill, and the exceedingly powerful Gavaya, and that monkey, Gavaksha, master of the leaping ones,11 like a haughty bull among kine, go in the van of the monkey-host. And let that foremost of monkeys, Rishava, go, protecting the right wing (of the army); and let Gandha, irrisistible like an elephant with the fragrant temporal juice trickling down, and the vehement Gandhamādana, go,12 protecting the left wing (of the monkey-army). And, cheering the army, I myself, mounted on Hanumān, like the Lord (mounted) on Airāvata, shall march in the midst of the forces. And like the lord of wealth and master of riches, mounted on Sārvabhauma, let Lakshmana resembling the Destroyer, march forth, mounted on Angada. And let that king of bears, the long-armed Jāmbavān, Sushena, and the monkey, Vegadarçi, protect the rear (of the forces)\". Hearing Rāghava's words, that foremost of monkeys and lord of the army, the exceedingly energetic Sugriva, issued his orders. And anon those highly powerful monkeys issuing up from caves and mountain-summits, began to bound (on all sides). Thereafter, honored by the king of monkeys and also Lakshmana, the righteous Rāma, accompanied by his forces, set out in a southerly direction. And he marched, surrounded by hundreds and thousands, Kotis and Ayutas of monkeys resembling elephants. And he marching was followed by the mighty host of monkeys; and all those maintained by Sugriva were filled with joy and betrayed demonstrations of delight. And bounding by way of guarding the flanks of the forces, and leaping in front of the army for pioneering, blustering, emitting leonine roars, and uttering cries, the monkeys made towards the south. And some partook of perfumed honey and fruits, and some bore mighty trees, holding the sprouts. And some in pride (of strength) suddenly raised others and threw them down. And some fell and were anon up, and some brought others down. 'We shall slay Rāvana, as also all the rangers of the night'; thus did the monkeys roar out in the presence of Rāghava. Before (the army), Rhrishabha, the heroic Nila, and Kumuda, along with many monkeys, went on clearing the route. In the middle were king Sugriva, Rāma and Lakshamana, environed by innumerable powerful and terrible monkeys. And the heroic monkey, Satavali, surrounded by ten Kotis (of troops), alone on all sides protected that monkey host. And accompanied by an hundred Kotis, Kesari, Panasa, Gaja13 and Arka, by means of many protected that host on every side. And taking Sugriva before them, Sushena, and Jāmbavān, surrounded by innumerable bears, protected the rear (of the army.) And that foremost of rangers possessed of excellence, and of restrained senses, the heroic Nila, general (of the army), kept going round the ranks. And Vālimukha, and Prajangha, Jambha and the monkey Rabhasa, went everywhere, urging on the monkeys. While thus marching, breathing pride of strength, those tiger-like monkeys saw that foremost of mountains Sahya crowned with hundreds of trees, and watery expanses laughing with flowers, and beautiful tanks. And knowing the order of Rāma of dreadful wrath, that terrible and mighty host, exceedingly terrific and resembling the bosom of the deep, cowed down through fear, leaving behind cities and villages and provinces, went like the deep-sounding sea. And at the side of Daçaratha's son those heroic monkeys resembling elephants, proceeded by bounds, like noble horses, spurred on. And those foremost of men, mounted on the monkeys, looked beautiful like the Sun and the Moon half eclipsed by the two mighty planets, viz., Rāhu and Ketu. And (thus) did the righteous Rāma proceed towards the South, accompanied by his army. Then Lakshmana, furnished with consummate sense and promptitude, who was mounted on Angada, spoke unto Rāma, inviting words, fraught with import. \"Speedily recovering Vaidehi, who hath been carried away, and slaying Rāvana, thou wilt, thy end attained, return to Ayodhyā, who shall also have her desire. O Rāghava, I see all the great auspicious omens on earth and in the sky, signifying success unto thee. Mildly and grateful doth the blessed breeze blow behind the army, inspiring pleasure. And the birds and beasts are crying in sonorous voices. And all the points (of the compass) appear pleasant; and the lord of day is cloudless. Bhrigu's son, Uçanas, also weareth for thee an auspicious aspect, and Dhruva is without blemish. And all the rishis, pure and furnished with lustre, go round Dhruva. And before us shineth the grandfather of the high-souled Ikshwākus; the spotless Rājarshi Triçanku, with his priest.—And stainless and free from disturbances appeareth Visākhā. This is the racial star of us, the high-souled Ikshwākus. And Nairita, the racial star of the Nairitas, is sore afflicted and, touched by the rod-bearing Dhumketu is in trouble. All this is for the destruction of the Rākshasas. At the fated time, those that are in the clutches of Death, have their stars afflicted by the planets. And the water is dear and tastes sweet; and the woods are stocked with fruit. And the odorous gale doth not blow strongly; and the trees are furnished with all blossoms of of the season. And, O lord, this host of monkeys appeareth splendid to the height, as did the celestial host on the occasion of the destruction of Tāraka. Seeing all this, thou shouldst, O noble one, feel delighted\". Having thus consoled his brother, Sumitrā's son, feeling enlivened, said this. The monkey-host went on, covering the earth. And the mighty dust raised by bears, monkeys, and tigers, having for their weapons nails and teeth,—with the foreparts of their feet and hands, enveloped the world, and the splendour of the sun was obscured. And as clouds envelope the sky, the mighty monkey-host went on, covering up the Southern quarter with its mountains, woods, and sky. And as they marched covering many a yojana, the streams seemed as if they flowed in an opposite direction.14 And they, while proceeding, took rest by pools of clear water, on mountains covered with trees, on plains and in forests teeming with fruits. Some moving straight, some moving askance, and some moving on the earth, that enormous monkey-host went on covering the entire earth. And they were all of delighted countenances and gifted with the velocity of the wind. And these monkeys devoted all their energy to the accomplishment of Rāghava's work. And they were displaying unto each other their joy, prowess and energy. And influenced with the vanity of youth they set up diverse cries. Some proceeded with speed, some leaped, some set up cries expressing joy, some were uplifting their tails, and some were striking the ground with their feet. Some, stretching forth their arms, were breaking the hills, and others the trees. And others were ascending the tops of the hills. Some began to make terrible sounds, and others made a tingling noise. And many others blasted the creepers with the velocity of their thighs. And some were engaged in sporting with trees and rocks. And thus was the earth enveloped with millions and kotis of fearful monkeys. And thus the enormous monkey host went on day and night. And all those monkeys, delighted, guided by Sugriva, and taking delight in battle, went on speedily. And they did not take rest even for a moment, desirous of rescuing Sitā. Thereupon, getting at the mount Sahya covered with various trees and forests, those monkeys ascended it. And Rāma went on beholding the variegated forest, rivers and fountains of the mount Sahya and Malaya. And those monkeys broke down various trees—Champakas, Tilakās, mangos, *Prasekas, Sindubarakas, Tiniças and Karaviras, Asokas, Karanjas, Plakshas, Nyagrodhas, Jambukas and Amalakas. And seated on picturesque rocks, various forest trees, shaken by the wind, showered flowers on them. And there blew in those forests filled with the smell of honey, a wind of pleasant touch, cool as the Moon, accompanied by the hummings of the bees. And that mount was richly embellished with diverse metals. And dust issuing from these metals and thickened by the air, enveloped on all sides the huge monkey-host. There blossomed in that picturesque mountain-vale Ketakas, Sindubaras, beautiful Vasantees, Mādhabis, Gandhapurnas, Kandas, Chiravilyas, Mahikas, Vanjulas, Vakulas, Ranjakas, Tilakās, Nagas, Chutas, Patalikas, Kobidaras, Muchlindas, Arjunas, Singsapas, Kutajas, Pintalas, Tiniças, Churnkas, Neepakas, Neela-Sokas, Saralas, Ankolas and lotuses. And all these trees were greatly disturbed by those monkeys, delighted with their view. There were in that mountain many a picturesque lake and pond filled with Chakravakas and Karandavas, ducks, Chraunchas and the mount abounded on all sides with boars, deer, and terrible bears, lions and tigers and various other fearful animals, and it was beautified with full blown lotuses, lilies, Utpalas and various other fragrant trees growing in the water. And various birds set up their musical choir on the summit of that mount. And bathing and drinking, these monkeys sported in the water. And ascending the mount these monkeys continually bounded. And excited with drink, they crumbled into pieces the ambrosia-smelling fruits, roots and flowers of the trees. And those monkeys yellow as honey, delighted, feasted on mangoes, long and measuring a drona. Breaking down the trees, blasting the creepers, bounding from one tree to another and making the mount Sahya echo, those leading monkeys went on delighted and excited with drink. Some ascending the trees, and others drinking, the whole earth was enveloped with those monkeys, and seemed as if beautified with ripe paddy crops. And reaching the mount Mahendra, the large-armed Rāma, having eyes like lotuses, ascended the summit adorned with diverse trees. And getting at the top, Daçaratha's son espied the vast deep filled with tortoises and fishes. Thereupon, passing by the mounts Sahya and Malaya and arranging their enormous host, they15 by and by reached the roaring deep. And descending therefrom, Rāma, the foremost of those who minister happiness unto all, accompanied by Lakshmana and Sugriva, entered the forest situate on the banks of the ocean. And reaching the expansive banks having rocks thereon and continually washed by the rising billows, Rāma spoke saying,—\"O Sugriva we have arrived at the abode of Varuna. Now hath arisen in my mind what I had not thought of before. And this ocean, the lord of the streams, whose other side is not seen, cannot be crossed over without some excellent measure. Let the monkey-host be encamped here therefore, and then concert a plan by means of which they might get at the other side. And reaching the shores of the ocean, the large-armed Rāma, stricken with grief for Sitā, ordered their encampment, saying,—\"O foremost of monkeys, do thou encamp thy host on the brink of the ocean. Now hath arrived the hour for counsel, when we should devise some plan for crossing over the main. I fear the Rākshasas at every step, for they are greatly illusion creating—let the leaders therefore go to their own hosts and let them not proceed anywhere else, renouncing them\". Hearing the words of Rāma, Sugriva along with Lakshmana, encamped the army on the brink of the ocean covered with trees. And stationed near the main, the monkey-host in consequence of their resemblance in colour with the blue contents of the deep, looked like a second ocean. Thereupon, reaching the shore, those leading monkeys engaged in concerting a plan to cross over the vasty deep. And the tumult, of that monkey-host encamped there, was heard above the roaring of the deep. And that huge army of the monkeys commanded by Sugriva, and set up in three divisions, were deeply concerned with the accomplishment of Rāma's work. And reaching the shore of the vasty deep, that monkey host, delighted, beheld the ocean moved by the Wind. And they waited there beholding the deep of unimpeded expanse, having its distant shore inhabited by the demons, and thronged with various aquatic animals. While upheaving its foam on the approach of eve, it appeared laughing and setting up its surges, it appeared to dance. It increased with the rising of the Moon and he reflected himself on its breast. That abode of Varuna was infested with gigantic sharks, whales and Timingalas16, disturbed with the fury of the Wind, filled with serpents having flaming frames, and various aquatic animals and rocks and was fathomless deep. It had picturesque fortresses on its marge and its other shore was hard to get at. And the Makaras17 and serpents living therein were moved by the Wind. The waters, as if delighted, were rising and falling. And having serpents of flaming frames underneath, it appeared as if sprinkled with scintillations of fire. And that terrible abode of the demons extended down to the regions inhabited by the Nagas or serpents. The deep resembled the welkin and the welkin the deep, and there appeared no difference between them. The sky crested with stars and the deep filled with gems resembled each other. The sky enveloped with clouds and the ocean overflowing with surges presented no contrast whatsoever. The waves of the mighty deep beating at each other continually, set up a sound resembling that of a trumpet in the sky. It was filled with diverse gems and its water was poisoned by means of the air. It was filled with various aquatic animals, and upheaving its billows, it appeared as if excited with ire. And there beheld those high-souled monkeys the mighty main agitated by the Wind and muttering as if with the upheaval of the waves. Thereupon, overwhelmed with surprise, those monkeys, stationed there, espied the main brimming with rolling waters and moving as if (off its place)."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "There on the northern shore of the ocean the army was encamped and arranged in order by Nila. And the two leading monkeys Mainda and Divida patrolled about on all sides to protect the monkey host. And the army being encamped on the shore of the lord of streams and rivers, Rāma, beholding Lakshmana by his side, spoke, saying—\"I know that grief abates as time passes by, but my sorrow arising from the separation of my spouse, is increasing day by day. I am not sorry that she hath been stealthily taken away by the demon—but my sorrow is that her end is drawing nigh. O Wind, do thou go there where my dear spouse is, and touching her person, do thou touch me, for I shall then be happy stationing my looks in the Moon and being touched by thee. Alas! my dear one cried 'O lord, O lord' when she was taken away. Those words, revolving burn me like poison. I am now being burnt down day and night by the fire of desire, having separation from her for its fuel and her thoughts for its flame. Leaving thee, O Son of Sumitrā, I shall jump into the deep and then shall not this fire burn me any more. This is my only consolation, for which I draw my vital breath—that myself and she breathe on the same earth. Like unto a dry land drawing water from a watered ground, I do live, hearing that Jānaki still survives. When shall I, discomfitting my enemies, behold Sitā, having a beautiful waist and eyes resembling lotus-petals, as a victorious hero beholdeth the royal Grace. Like unto the sick drinking the elixir of life, when shall I, raising a little her lotus-like countenance having graceful teeth and lips, imprint kisses thereon? And when shall she, laughing, embrace me with her rising breast resembling the palm fruit? Alas that chaste dime having scarlet corners of the eye, being encircled by the demons, is wishing for a protector like unto one having no husband, albeit having a husband in me. How fareth in the midst of the she-demons, that daughter of the king Janaka, my beloved spouse, and the daughter-in-law of king Daçaratha? And having those Rākshasas, hard to repress, slain by me, truly shall she appear like unto the rays of the Moon extricated from sable autumnal clouds. Sitā is constitutionally slender, and forsooth, she has been greatly reduced by sorrow, fasting and calamities touching time and place. When shall I, piercing with my shafts the breast of the lord of Rākshasas, renounce my mind's grief? And when shall my devoted Sitā resembling the daughter of a celestial, fling herself anxiously around my neck and shed tears of joy? And when shall I renounce this my sorrow arising out of Maithili's separation, like unto one casting off his soiled clothes?\" The highly intelligent Rāma bewailing thus, the day passed away and the Sun, decreasing gradually, disappeared at last. And consoled by Lakshmana, Rāma, stricken with thought touching Sitā having eyes like lotus-petals, engaged in rites relating to the worship of Eve."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Beholding in Lankā that dreadful and awe-inspiring work performed by Hanumān like unto the high-souled Sakra, the lord of Rākshasas, looking down with shame, addressed them all, saying—\"That monkey alone hath invaded and entered the city of Lankā hard to reach and hath espied Sitā, the daughter of king Janaka. He hath shattered the palace, and the altar of sacrifice, slain the leading Rākshasas, and, in short, agitated the whole city of Lankā. What shall I do now? And what should you all do on this occasion? It behoveth you all to give me such counsel as becometh me and will conduce to my glory\". 'Victory is the outcome of consultation'—this do the sages18 say. Let us, therefore, O mighty ones, engage in counsel, relating to the measures we should adopt towards Rāma. There are three orders of men on this earth—the superior the middling and the inferior. This distinction cannot be perceived without a knowledge of the signs, and so I shall relate unto you their merits and demerits. He is said to belong to the superior order, whose counsel contains the three signs (mentioned below), or who engages in works after consulting duly with friends capable or with persons having the same end in view, and some times with others, and who serveth Providence. He belongs to the middle order who consults his own self only, depends on the Providence, and engages alone in works. And he belongs to the inferior order who engageth in works without ascertaining their merits or demerits, disregarding the will of the Providence and saying, 'I will do this', and is inactive (at last). And counsels are also divided into three divisions like unto the three orders of men (mentioned). That counsel belongs to the superior order in which the counsellors with their judgment reinforced by a knowledge of political ethics, are unanimous. That one belongs to the middle order in which the counsellors after varied discussion, arrive at unanimity in the long run. And that one is the worst in which the counsellors differ from each other and agree a little in the long run, with no good result. You are all gifted with good intellects: do you all unanimously settle as to what becometh me and conduceth to my well-being. Environed by a thousand of patient monkeys, Rāma, with a view to capture our city, is approaching towards Lankā. Forsooth, shall he cross over the main along with his younger brother and a mighty host. He can by his prowess dry up the ocean and do the other.19 Rāma approaching thus with a hostile intention along with the monkeys, it behoveth you to devise such means as might protect my city and army."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Being thus accosted by their lord, the highly powerful Rākshasas, devoid of good sense and ignorant of sound counsel, replied with folded palms, saying,—\"Thou hast, O king, enough of soldiers and weapons. Why art thou smitten with sorrow then? Repairing to Bhagavati, thou didst discomfit the serpents in battle. The God of Death, living on mount Kailāça, encircled by Yakshas, was subjugated by thee in a great battle. And that mighty lord of men, proud of his friendship with Siva, was defeated by thee wrathfully in battle. Discomfitting and slaying the band of Yakshas, thou didst bring this flowery car from the mount Kailāça. O lord of Rākshasas, desiring thy friendship out of fear, Maya, the king of Dānavas, offered thee his daughter20 for thy spouse. O thou of mighty arms, thou didst bring under thy subjection the powerful and irrepressible Dānava21 for the pleasure of Kumbhinasi.22 And entering the region under the earth, thou didst defeat the serpents—and thus bring under thy subjection Vāsuki, Takshaka, Sankha, and Jati. Those heroic Dānavas, the Kalakeyas, were greatly powerful, irrepressible, and proud of the boons conferred on them. And fighting with them perpetually for a year, thou didst bring them under thy control, O lord, O slayer of foes, and learn from them the science of varied illusions, O king of the Rākshasas. O great hero, by thee were defeated in battle, the heroic and powerful sons of Varuna, followed by a fourfold division of their army. The dominion of Death is like the mighty main, having his rod for aquatic animals, agonies for the trees that cover its islands, the noose for the billows, his attendants for the serpents and his terrible fever for the dreadful attitude of the deep. And diving into this terrible deep, thou didst, O king, discomfit Death himself and win glorious victory. And every one was pleased there with thy successful fight. The Earth was filled with various heroic Kshetriyas, resembling Sakra in prowess as she is adorned now with various trees. Rāghava is not their equal either in strength or prowess. And all those heroes, hard to repress in battle, were slain by thee, O king. Do thou wait here, O great king; thou needst not take any trouble. Indrajit alone shall slay all these monkeys. And this one, O mighty monarch, having celebrated the Māheçwara23 sacrifice, hath obtained a noble boon, rarely (attained by persons). Having agitated the ocean of celestial hosts, having darts and lances for its fishes, showering arms for its moss, elephants for its tortoises, steeds for its frogs, Rudra and Aditya for its ferocious animals, the Maruts and Vasus for its mighty serpents, cars, horses, and elephants for its volume of waters, and infantry for its spacious shore, this one (Indrajit), taking captive the lord of the celestials himself, had brought him into Lankā. Then, O king, liberated agreeably to the injunction of the Great-father, the slayer of Samvara and Vritra, worshipped of all the celestials, went (back) to heaven. Do thou, O great king, entrust Indrajit with this business,—until he bringeth to destruction the monkey-host along with Rāma. O king, thou must not think that this calamity, coming from an ignoble person is not insignificant. Thou shalt slay Rāghava\"."

Having been negligent and confident (in our power), we have all been deceived by Hanumān. But, I living, that ranger of woods shall not (again) go hence with his life. All the earth down to the ocean, containing hills, forests and woods, shall be rendered free from monkeys. Do thou command me. And, O ranger of the night, I shall deliver (the Rākshasas) from the monkeys; and thou shalt not have to suffer in the least in consequence of thy transgression\".24 Then the Rākshasa named Durmukha, growing enraged, said,—\"This overpowering of all of us must not be forgiven—this flagrant discomfiture of the metropolis of the auspicious lord of the Rākshasas as well as of his inner appartment by the foremost of monkeys. This moment marching alone (from hence) will I exterminate the monkeys, even if they shall have entered the dreadful deep, or the sky, or the subterranean regions\". Then the exceedingly powerful Vajradanshtra, weilding up a terrific bludgeon, stained with flesh and gore, wrathfully observed,—\"Rāma the irrepressible existing, and also Sugriva with Lakshmana, what have we to do with the weak and wretched Hanumān? This very day, slaying single-handed Rāma with Sugriva and with Lakshmana, with this bludgeon, shall I return, after having sorely troubled the monkey-host. And, O monarch, if thou art minded, hear this other word of mine! Verily he that is fertile in resources and ever ready, compasseth success. Let thousands of Rākshasas, heroic, terrible, fearful to behold, and wearing forms at will, appointed by the lord of Rākshasas, presenting themselves before Kākutstha in palpably human shapes, calmly say unto that foremost of the Raghus,—'Despatched have we been by thy younger brother.' Hearing this, he (Rāma), summoning his forces without delay, shall come hither. Then, equipped with darts, javelins and maces, and bearing bows, arrows and scimitars in our hands, we shall swiftly and summoning speed25 set out (from hence); and stationing ourselves in the sky in bands, and slaughtering the monkey-army with mighty showers of rocks and weapons, we shall lead it to Death's door. Let us in this wise decoy Rāma and Lakshmana; and if they fall into our design, they shall, without doubt, lose their lives\". Then that hero, Kumbhakarna's son, named Nikumbha, endowed with exceeding prowess, in high wrath remarked unto Rāvana, destroyer of worlds,—\"Do ye, all of you, stay here along with the great king. I alone shall slay Rāghava together with Lakshmana, and Sugriva with Hanumān, and all the monkeys\". Then a Rākshasa, named Vajrahanu, resembling a hill, in wrath lapping the corners of his mouth with his tongue, said,—\"Do ye, casting off anxiety, engage yourself as ye list. I alone shall swallow up that entire monkey-host. Do ye, remaining at ease and without anxiety, drink Vāruna26 wine. I single-handed shall slay Sugriva with Lakshmana, as well as Hanumān with Angada,—and all the monkeys."

Then, preventing them, who had (thus) equipped themselves with all kinds of weapons, and making them sit down, Vibhishana, with joined hands, again spoke unto them, saying,—\"The wise have asserted that an appeal to prowess should be resorted to anent a business then only when the end sought cannot be attained through the three (other) means.27 Prowess produceth fruit only in respect of well-advised action directed while carefully watching (enemies) that are negligent, or captive,28 or under Divine affliction. But why do ye intend to discomfit (Rāma), who is vigilant, who desireth victory, who is strong in the Divine strength, who hath subdued passion, and who is hard to subdue? Who had in this world ever thought of or reasoned about Hanumān's career over the dreadful deep, the lord of streams and rivers? O rangers of the night, the strength and prowess (of the foe) being immeasurable, ye should by no means recklessly disregard him. And what was the wrong that formerly had been done by Rāma unto the king of the Rākshasas, that he hath carried off from Janasthāna the spouse of that illustrious one? If Khara, who had trespassed into regions not his own, hath been slain in battle by Rāma, surely a creature should to the best of his might preserve his life. It is for this great fear that exerciseth us on the score of Vaidehi owing its existence to this,29 that she, having been ravished, should (now) be given up. What is the use of acting so that quarrel may be the consequence? And (Rāma), possessed of prowess, yet ever abiding by morality, is incapable of initiating hostilities for no purpose. Therefore, do ye give him his Maithili. And before, he by means of his shafts riveth this city together with her elephants and steeds, overflowing with countless gems, do ye give him his Maithili. And before the dreadful, irrepressible and mighty monkey-host blocketh up this Lankā of ours, do ye give (back) Sitā. This city of Lankā shall perish as also all the heroic Rākshasas, if thou dost not thyself make over Rāma's spouse unto him. I exert myself to pleasure thee, because of the fraternity (that subsisteth between us). Do what I say. I say what is truth and what also is for thy good. Do thou render (back) Rāma's Maithili. Ere yet the king's son, for compassing thy destruction, showereth sure shafts resembling the rays of the autumnal Sun, having shining heads and feathered parts, and exceedingly hard, do thou render Maithili unto Dāçarathi. Forsake thy wrath at once, which destroyeth happiness and virtue; and follow righteousness, which enhanceth enjoyment and fame. Be thou propitious,—so that we may live (at ease) along with our sons and relatives! Render (back) Maithili unto Daçaratha's son\".

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Then early in the morning, like the fiery and refulgent sun entering a mighty mass of clouds, Vibhishana, fast to virtue and interest, heroic and possessed of exceeding splendour, playing a perilous part,30 entered the apartment of his elder brother, resembling an assemblage of mountain-summits and elevated like the peak of a mountain, orderly, divided into spacious rooms,—the resort of the great—inhabited by august and intelligent persons attached (to Rāvana); guarded around by lusty Rākshasas in limited numbers; having the air agitated by the breath of mad elephants; with loud blares of conchs, and resounding with trumpets; embosoming numbers of beautiful damsels, with its high-ways (overflowing with talk); furnished with doors of polished gold; embellished with excellent ornaments; resembling the abode of the Gandharbas, or the mansion of the Maruts; containing heaps of gems; like unto the dwelling of serpents. And that one of exceeding energy heard sacred and holy sounds uttered by Veda-versed Brahmanas celebrating the victory of his brother; and that highly powerful (hero) acquainted with Mantras and the Vedas saw Vipras worshipped with vessels of curds, clarified butter, flowers and fried paddy. And the mighty-armed (Vibhishana) saluted the younger brother of the bestower of riches,31 seated there. And that one acquainted with manners, after proper courtesy, sat him down on a seat decked in gold, which was pointed out (by a royal glance). And in retirement as also in presence only of his counsellors, Vibhishana spoke unto the high souled Rāvana words backed by reason, and greatly fraught with his welfare. And having, with soothing speech, pacified his elder brother and extended towards him the due civilities, that one, who through height of sentiment had noted excellence and the want of it, addressed (Vibhishana) in words befitting the occasion and the place,—\"Ever since, O subduer of enemies, Vaidehi hath come hither, are seen inauspicious omens. Fire, enveloped in smoke at the time of its being ignited, and thereafter throwing out scintillations, with its brightness obscured by vapour, doth not increase adequately even on oblations being poured into it with Mantras. Reptiles are discovered in kitchens, sacrificial fire-chambers, and the places of Vaidika recitations; and ants (are found) in clarified butter. The milk of the kine hath been dried up; and the nobler elephants are without the temporal juice. And horses, albiet they have feasted on fresh grass, neigh distressfully.32 And asses, camels and mules, O king, with their hair standing erect, shed tears; and although they are ministered unto medically, they do not return to nature. And crows in numbers emit harsh cries on all sides, and are seen in swarms at the tops of edifices. Vultures sit sadly and distressed upon the roofs of houses. During the two twilights, the jackals, coming in sight, utter ominous howls. And wolves and other (ferocious) animals, as well as deer, approaching the gate of the palace in swarms, are heard to set up loud roars resembling the thunder. Things having come to this pass, even this expiation, I fancy, is capable of removing the evil omens. Do thou render back Vaidehi unto Rāghava. If I have said this through ignorance or covetuousness, thou ought not, O mighty monarch, criminate me. All Rākshasas and Rakshasis, as well as those belonging to palace and the inner apartment—shall have to experience the evil consequence (of this act of thine). All the counsellors have retrained from tendering this counsel unto thee; but surely I must tell thee what I have seen or heard; and adopting proper measures, it behoveth thee to act so\".33 (Rāvana's) brother, Bibhishana, thus spoke, unto his brother, the chief of Rakshas, in the midst of counsellors, these words fraught with his good. Hearing this beneficial, mild and pregnant speech, fortified by reasons and capable of compassing (his welfare) for the present, past and the future, (Rāvana) who had conceived a passion (for Sitā), getting into a rage, replied,—\"Fear find I none whatever. Rāghava never shall have Mithilā's daughter. Even if Lakshmana's elder brother should be supported in battle by the celestials with Indra (at their head), how can he stay before me (in the field)?\" Having said this, that destroyer of celestial hosts, the Ten-necked one, possessed of mighty strength and of terrific prowess in battle, then dismissed his brother Vibhishana, who had spoken truth."

And the occasion for war was wanting. Rāvana, possessed by lust, and continually thinking of Vaidehi, conceived along with his counsellors that the time for entering into hostilities had arrived. And sallying forth, he ascended a mighty car furnished with golden network, adorned with pearls and coral, and yoked with trained steeds. And having ascended that excellent vehicle, having sounds resembling those of mighty clouds, that foremost of Rakshas, the Ten necked one, drove towards the court. And as he coursed on, Rākshasas, bearing swords and shields, and carrying all kinds of weapons, went before the lord of the Rākshasas. And (some of) these, wearing various frightful suits, and decked with diverse ornaments, went, surrounding his rear and flanks. And atirathas went with cars, and superb mad elephants, and sportive steeds; and bearing in their hands maces and bludgeons; and darts and clubs. And as Rāvana marched towards the court, there arose the loud blares of thousand trumpet, and the uproarious sounds of conches. And that redoubtable and mighty car-warrior held his course, suddenly making sides resound, and beautifying the highways. And the spotless white umbrella of the lord of Rākshasas, being raised up, looked beautiful like the Moon at her full. On his right and left graced two crystal white chowris furnished with threads of gold. And all the Rākshasas standing on the ground with joined hands, bow down their heads to the foremost of Rākshasas who was seated on his car. Hymned by the Rākshasas with blessings for victory, that exceedingly energetic chastiser of enemies arrived at the court constructed (by Viçwakarmā). And that highly energetic one in person entered that court paved with silver and gold, having its heart decorated with crystal, and gracefully covered with silk, embroidered with gold; excellently constructed by Viçwakarmā, and guarded by six hundred ghosts. And Rāvana sat down on a superior and august seat consisting of lapises, furnished with a pillow; and covered with a soft dear-skin. And lord-like, he commanded the envoys possessed of fleet vigor, saying, \"Do ye speedily summon hither the Rākshasas. I fan some mighty effort hath to be put forth against our foes. Hearing his words, the envoys began to range Lankā; and going to every house, they fearlessly collected the Rākshas from places of sport, bed-rooms, and gardens. Then some set out, mounting cars, and some mounting proud coursers, and some on foot. And like the welkin filled with fowls, the city thronged with approaching cars, elephants and steeds. And leaving their various vehicles and cars behind, they entered the court on foot, like lions entering mountain caverns. And taking the feet of the sovereign, and honored by him (in turn), they sat them down, some on raised seats, some on cushions of Kuça, and some on the floor. And presenting themselves agreeably to the command of the monarch, they sat them down each according to his position, before the lord of Rākshasas, Rāvana. And there came also the learned and competent to arrive at infallible decisions, and they sat them down in order of merit. And there also came courtiers endowed with virtues, versed in every thing, and having intelligence for their eye-sight,—and innumerable heroes by hundreds also (arrived) at that court for ascertaining the course that would prove beneficial. And then mounting a large, noble and splendid car, having its parts decked with gold, and yoked with horses, the magnanimous and renowned Vibhishana went to the court of his elder brother. And that younger brother (of Rāvana), announcing his name, bowed down at the feet of his elder brother. And Suka and Prahasta were employed in giving to each a separate seat befitting his rank. And from all sides in the court there began to spread the odour of excellent agura and sandal and wreaths belonging to the Rākshasas, decked in gold and various gems, and clad in costly attires. And no one among these present at court uttered any thing, or spoke any falsehood, or conversed in loud accents. And having completely attained their desire, all of fierce prowess, gazed at the face of their lord. And in the assembly of those intelligent, and exceedingly powerful persons, equipped with arms, the intelligent Rāvana appeared splendid like the Vajra-handed Indra among the Vasus."

Thereat, Prahasta, carefully carrying out the royal behest, stationed all the forces within and without the city. And having posted the army for the defence of the city, Prahasta sitting down before the king, said,—\"I have stationed the forces belonging to thee who art possessed of strength, inside as well as outside. (Now), without suffering thy mind to be agitated with anxiety, speedily, do what is in thy heart. Hearing the speech of Prahasta seeking the welfare of the kingdom, Rāvana craving for enjoyment spoke in the midst of his aderents,—\"When virtue, or happiness, or interest is in straits, it behoveth you to (know your course) in relation to pleasant and unpleasant, happiness and misery, profitable and unprofitable, and good and evil. No business of mine which ye have set about after taking counsel, hath ever miscarried. And like Vāsava environed by the moon, stars and planets, and the Maruts, I surrounded by you, have attained to plenitude of prosperity. I am, for certain, going to employ you all. In consequence of sleep, I could not inform him of this matter. After having slept for six months that one of prodigious strength—foremost of those bearing arms—hath just risen. Janaka's daughter and Rāma's beloved wife hath been brought hither from the forest of Dandaka, the region ranged by Rakshas. That indolent damsel wisheth not to ascend my bed; nor is there any in the three spheres, that to me is like unto Sitā. She is slender waisted, and high-hipped, and her face is as the autumnal Moon resembling a golden image. She is meek and looketh like the hand work of Maya himself gifted with an infinite variety of fascinations.34 And beholding her dainty and tender feet with roseate soles, and having coppery nails, my mind burneth (with desire). And seeing her resembling the flame of a sacrificial fire and the splendour of the Sun himself; and her fair face furnished with a prominent nose and elegant eyes, I, having lost control over self, have come under the sway of desire. And my passion, uninfluenced by anger and joy, capable of producing pallor, and constantly causing anguish and sorrow, hath rendered me pale. Expecting her lord, Rāma, the beautiful one having expansive eyes, hath solicited for a year's space; and I have pledged my fair woods to her of graceful eyes. But tired am I on account of my passion,—like a horse spent on the way. How can the rangers of the woods, or the sons of Daçaratha cross over the sea ungovernable and swarming with countless creatures and fishes? On the other hand, a single month hath troubled us grievously. Hard it is therefore to understand the course of events. Do ye act, each as he thinks proper. And although no fear can come from mortals, yet ye should deliberate (as to what ye should do). Formerly I had gained victory with the help given by you; do ye in the same way stand by me now. The king's son, having learnt that Sitā is on the other shore of the ocean, taking before them monkeys headed by Sugriva, reached Varuna's abode. Do ye so counsel that Sitā may be with-holden by me and the sons of Daçaratha may be slain; but ye must prefer certain counsel. No other35 person in this world hath the power to cross the sea along with the monkeys,—victory, therefore, is undubitably mine\". Hearing the sorrowful speech of (Rāvana) afflicted with lust, Kumbhakarna greatly enraged, and said,—\"When just on seeing (Sitā) of Rāma along with Lakshmana, thou didst by main force carry her away, it plainly appeareth that thy mind, like the Yamuna filling her bed, hath been possessed (by her).36 O great king, all this (that thou hast done) is not worthy of thee. If thou hadst at the outset consulted us in this matter, we would have done what was proper.37 O ten-faced one, the king that arriving at certain conclusions, carrieth on his regal affairs agreeably to justice, hath not to repent afterwards. But those actions that are done without deliberation, like unto clarified butter poured in an impure sacrifice, conduces only to harm. He doth not know what is proper and what not, that performs prior actions afterwards, and posterior actions first. Others spy holes in the actions of the volatile; the latter may be possessed of great power,—like swans passing Krauncha through the hole.38 By luck it is that Rāma hath not yet slain thee, who hath done this tremendous thing, without reflection, resembling food mixed with poison. But as thou hast entered upon a course of action which is improper even in respect of foes, I will, O sinless one, perform thy work by slaying thy enemies. And, O ranger of the night, I will exterminate thy foe. Even if Sakra and the sun-god, even if fire and the War-god, even if Kuvera and Varuna should range themselves against me, I will fight them. Purandara himself shall be afflicted with fright when I have my body measuring a mountain, and furnished with sharp teeth, shall, setting up roars, fight with my huge bludgeon. Before Rāma shooteth a second shaft, to slay me, I shall drink his life-blood. Be thou comforted by slaying Daçaratha's son, I will exert to secure blessed victory for thee. Having killed Rāma along with Lakshmana, I shall devour all the principal monkeys. Do thou make merry at thy will, drink the Varuni, and, with thy mind set at rest, conduct affairs fraught with thy welfare. On Rāma being despatched to the mansion of Yama, Sitā shall come under thy subjection for ever and a day\"."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Seeing Rāvana wrought up with wrath, the exceedingly strong Mahāpārcwa, reflecting for a moment, observed with joined hands,—\"The man that, entering the forest, abounding with deer and ferocious animals, doth not drink honey, maketh a fool of himself. O destroyer of foes, who is the lord of thee, that art lord thyself? Enjoy with Vaidehi, taking thy enemy by the hand. And, O thou endowed with prodigious power, do thou exerting thy might lead thy life, after the manner of hens, and invading Sitā again and again, do thou enjoy her and derive pleasure (therefrom). And when thou hast attained thy purpose; what fear can succeed? Alike when on thy guard, and off it, thou shalt provide against all exigencies. Kumbhakarna along with us, as well the exceedingly powerful Indrajit, are competent to chastise the thunder-bearing (Deity) equipped with his thunder. Passing by gift, conciliation, and dissension, which have been assigned by the wise as the means of success, I relish the success in business which is attained through chastisement. O highly powerful one, we shall, without doubt, by the prowess of our arms, subdue all these enemies of thine that have come hither\". Thus addressed by Mahāpārcwa, king Rāvana, honoring his speech, said,—\"O Mahāpārcwa, I will relate unto thee, who hast spoken (thus) a secret matter relating to myself, which befell me to since I saw Panjikasthalā, like a flame in the sky, coursing to the Great-father's mansion. Her pace slackened, as soon as she saw me, (turn) I feasted on her and deprived her of her attire. Then she went to the Great-father's place like a crumpled lotus. That high-souled one received information of all that I had done; and thereat, waxed enraged, the Deity spoke unto me,—\"If from this day, thou ravish a female by force, thy head certainly shall be riven in an hundred pieces. It is for this, that with my mind afflicted with fear, I do not violently force, Videha's daughter Sitā, anent lying with her fair self. My rush is like that of the sea, and my motion that of the wind. Daçaratha's son doth not know this, and therefore doth he approach sea. Who wisheth to address a lion that is lying asleep in a cave resembling Death wrought up by wrath? Rāma hath not seen shafts shot by me, resembling two-tongued serpents and therefore, it is that he approacheth me. Like a met burning an elephant, I shall, with shafts shot from bows by hundreds, resembling the thunder-bolt, consume Rāma. And as at the proper hour the risen Sun defeateth the splendor of the stars, will I, surrounded by a mighty army, overpower his strength. Neither the thousand eyed Vāsava, nor Varuna, is capable of fighting me. By the might of this army did I formerly conquer this city, governed by Vaiçravana\"."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Hearing the words of the lord of Rākshasas, as well as the thundering of Kumbhakarna, Vibhishana addressed the Rākshasa chief, in a pregnant speech, fraught with his welfare,—\"Thou hast been bound about thy neck by the mighty and huge serpent, Sitā, having her breast for its body anxiety for its venom, smile for its sharp fangs, and her five fingers for its hood. Therefore before the monkeys, resembling mountain-peaks, having teeth for their arms and nails for their weapons,—subjugate Lankā, do thou render Maithili unto Daçaratha's son. And before the shafts shot by Rāma, resembling the thunder-bolt and having impetuosity of the wind, cut off the heads of the foremost of the Rākshasas, do thou render Mithilā's daughter unto the son of Daçaratha. Neither Kumbhakarna nor Indrajit, neither Mahāpārcwa nor Mahodara, neither Nikumbha nor Kumbha nor yet Atikaya, O king, can stay in the field against Rāghava. Living, thou, whether thou art protected by the Sun or the winds, or throwest thyself into the lap itself of Vāsava, or enterest the sky or the nether spheres, shall not escape death\". Hearing Vibhishana's words, Prahasta said,—\"Fear know we none whatever from the celestials, or Dānavas, or Yakshas, or Gandharbas, or huge snakes; fear know we none in battle with birds and serpents. How can fear at all afflict us proceeding from the king's son, Rāma? Hearing Prahasta's speech, Vibhishana, seeking the welfare of the king, and having his intellect grounded in virtue, interest and profit, said words enfolding high sense,—\"O Prahasta, like a sinful person being unable to ascend heaven, what the king, Mahodara, thou, and Kumbhakarna, are saying with reference to Rāma, shall not prove true. As one without a raft cannot cross over the mighty main, how can I, or thou, or all the Rākshas combined, cause death unto Rāma, who, O Prahasta, is versed in the sense of things. Even the gods become stolid before the sovereign of the Ikshwāku race, having righteousness for his principle quality, and being a mighty car-warrior and of such a character, and who is competent in action. As yet the Kanka-feathered, terrible and sharp shafts shot by Rāghava, have not pierced into thy body; and therefore thou dost speak so. And, O Prahasta, as yet the sharpened shafts, capable of destroying life and having the impetuosity of the thunder-bolt, have not entered into thy body, and therefore thou dost speak thus, neither Rāvana, nor the exceedingly powerful Triçirsha. Neither Kumbhakarna's son Nikumbha nor Indrajit, is capable of bearing in battle the son of Daçaratha, resembling Sakra himself. And neither Devāntaka39 nor Narantaka,40 neither Atikāya,41 nor the magnanimous Atiratha, nor the equally strong Akampana, is competent to stay Rāghava in fight. And the king, naturally of fierce temper and thoughtless, through the instrumentality of ye who appearing to be his friends are in reality his foes, seeketh to destroy the Rākshasas. Do ye take out and deliver the monarch, who hath through force become subject to a dreadful and mighty, and thousand-headed serpent bursting with immeasurable prowess. As a person possessed by fearfully strong ghosts, is saved by his friends pulling him by his hair, attaining your desire ye should, assembling together, rescue the king. This one is sunk in the Rāghava sea having excellent waters. Do ye speedily coming together deliver him. He (the king) hath fallen into the Kākutstha nether regions, I tell thee my full mind,—fraught with the welfare of this city together with the Rākshasas, as well of the king with his adherents. Do thou make over Maithili unto the son of the king. He is a true counsellor who adviseth his master, after duly ascertaining the strength, position, increase or destruction of the enemies as well as of their own party."

He even, who is not born in this race, cannot speak or act in this wise. Only one man in this family, my uncle Bibhisana, is weak in energy, strength, prowess, patience, heroism and vigor. Why art thou O timid one, afraid of them since any one of these Rākshasas is capable of slaying those two princes, human beings as they are? The master of the three worlds, the lord of the celestials, has been brought down by me as captive on this earth. And all the celestials smitten with fear fled to different quarters. I brought down on earth the loud-roaring celestial elephant Airavata and uprooted by force its tusks. And all the celestials were terrified at this. Am I not, who have shattered the pride of the celestials, afflicted the leading Daityas, and am gifted with excellent prowess, capable of discomfitting these two princess—very ordinary mortals as they are?\" Hearing the words of (Indrajit) gifted with high energy, irrepressible and resembling the lord of celestials, Bibhisana, the foremost of those using weapons, addressed him with words, fraught with high import,—\"O my son, thou art a mere child and of unripe intellect and hence thou art not capable of ascertaining the propriety and impropriety of counsels. Thou art therefore speaking thus like a maniac for thy own destruction. Thou art known as a son unto Rāvana, O Indrajit, but in sooth, thou art his foe in disguise, since knowing of his destruction from Rāghava, thou dost not prevent him. Thou art brave, childish and hast been impelled by thy silly understanding. Thou shalt be slain along with him who hath brought thee in this counsel chamber. Thou art, O Indrajit, foolish, imprudent, devoid of humility, of an irritable temper, of feeble sense, vicious-minded and of a silly understanding. And thou dost speak so, being impelled by childishness. Who shall withstand in battle, the shafts, shot by Rāghava, resembling the rod of Death, the stick of Brahman, flaming like the Fire of Dissolution. Do thou render back Sitā, king, unto Rāma, with riches, jewels, excellent ornaments, clothes and jems and we shall then be able to live here void of grief\"."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Bibhishana addressing him with these excellent and auspicious words, fraught with high sense, Rāvana, impelled by Death, again spake in harsh accents.—\"It is better to live with open enemies or enraged serpents than with those who pass for friends but are in reality foes. I know well the nature of kinsmen, in all the worlds, O Rakhasa,—one takes delight in another's misfortune. The kinsmen, O Rākshasa, generally disregard him who is their king,42 protecteth the kingdom, educated and pious—and they always try to discomfit him, if he be a hero. These terrible enemies—the kinsmen, hypocrite as they are, always take delight in one another's calamity. Hear, I shall relate what the elephants, in yore, spoke beholding some persons with noose in hand—\"We do not fear, fire, weapons, or even the terrible noose—we fear only the dreadful kinsmen, blinded with selfishness. They alone unfold the means of our destruction—there is not the least doubt about it. Fear from kinsmen is therefore known as the worst of all fears. In kine there is milk, in kinsmen, there is fear, in women there is fickleness, and in Brahmanas, there is asceticism. It doth not please thee, I fancy, O gentle one, that I am honored of the three worlds, the lord of riches, and the subduer of my foes. As the drops of water do not last long on the leaves of lotuses, so is the friendship with unworthy persons. As the autumnal clouds, albeit muttering, do not pour forth water, so is the friendship with unworthy persons. As a bee flies away after sucking up the honey so is the friendship with unworthy persons. As a bee, after feeding upon the Kāça flowers, doth not get honey so is (fruitless) the friendship with unworthy persons. As an elephant, after being bathed, covers its body again with dust, taking it with its trunk, so is the friendship with unworthy persons.43 Fie thee, O monkey, O thou that bringest disgrace on the family. Had any one else spoken thus he would have ceased to live by this time\". Being thus accosted harshly, Bibhisana, speaking truth, rose up along with four Rākshasas having maces in their hands. Thereupon, rising up in the welkin, the graceful brother Bibhisana, worked up with ire, addressed the lord of Rākshasas—\"Thou art mistaken, O king. Do thou speak what thou wishest—thou art my elder brother, adorable like unto father—thou dost not follow the track of virtue. I cannot tolerate the harsh accents of thine, my elder brother.—For thy welfare I spoke those well-meaning words, O Ten-necked one, but thou didst not pay heed to them being brought under the control of Death. O king, many are the persons who speak sweet words, but rare are they who can speak and hear unpalatable but well-meaning words. How can I disregard thy death like unto a burning house bound as thou art by the noose of Death, the destroyer of all creatures. I do not wish to behold thee slain by the well-sharpened shafts of Rāma, feathered in gold and resembling the flaming fire. Even the heroic and powerful persons, well versed in the use of weapons, wear away like sands in battle, being attracted by Death. Thou art worshipful unto me, do thou forgive me for what I have said for thy welfare. Do thou protect thyself and this city, abounding in Rākshasas. May good betide thee! I am going away and do thou be happy without me. What, I spoke unto thee, O ranger of the night, to prevent thee, for thy welfare, did not please thee. Persons, whose lease of life is well-nigh expired, do not pay heed to the well-meaning words of their friends\"."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Having addressed Rāvana with these harsh words, his younger brother, reached in no time, where Rāma along with Lakshmana was. The leading monkeys, stationed on earth, espied him on the welkin, resembling in size the summit of the mount Meru, and burning like lightning in the effulgence of his own person. And his four attendants of terrible prowess were adorned with excellent ornaments and armed with armours and maces. He was like unto a collection of clouds, powerful as the thunder-bolt, holding an excellent mace, heroic and embellished with excellent ornaments. And beholding him along with four counsellors, the highly intelligent Sugriva, the lord of monkeys, engaged in meditation along with them. And meditating for a while, he spoke unto the monkeys headed by Hanumān the following excellent words—\"Behold, there comes a Rākshasa, armed with various weapons and followed by four demons to slay us and there is not the least doubt about it\". And hearing the words of Sugriva, the excellent monkeys, taking up huge trees and crags, bespoke him,—\"Do thou order us, O king, to destroy these vicious-souleri demons. These shall crush them to death, limited as is the tenure of their life\". They addressing each other in this wise, Bibhisana descended from the sky on the northern shore. And beholding Sugriva and all others stationed near him, the highly intelligent Bibhisana accosted them, at the highest pitch of his voice, saying,—\"Liveth there the Rākshasa, Rāvana, the lord of demons, and perpetrator of many iniquitous deeds. I am his younger brother known as Bibhisana. By him, slaying the vulture Yatāyu, was carried away Sitā from Janasthāna. She is imprisoned, brought under his sway, poorly, and being well guarded by the Rākshasees. With various well meaning words and reasonings I pointed out unto him, the necessity of rendering back Sitā unto Rāma. And Rāvana, possessed by Death, paid no heed to my well-meaning words, like unto one, lying on the brink of death, neglecting the administration of medicine. Being reviled by him and treated harshly like a menial, I have come to seek Rāghava's shelter, renouncing my children and wives. Do ye soon mention unto the high-souled Rāghava, the refuge of all creatures, that Bibhisana hath arrived\". Hearing those words the quick-paced Sugriva, excited with ire, spake unto Rāma, before Lakshinana, saying,—\"Forsooth hath an enemy entered secretly in our midst and he shall slay us getting an opportunity like unto an owl killing the crows. O slayer of foes, it now behoveth thee to be particularly careful about the counsels, arrangement of soldiers, polity—civil and military and spies of our own party as well as those of the enemies. These Rākshasas are heroic; they assume shapes at will, always lie in ambush and secretly bring about others' ruin—we should not therefore place confidence in them. This must be the emissary of Rāvana—the lord of Rākshasas. Entering in our midst, he shall, in sooth, sow dissensions in our camp, or he shall slay us when we are careless, confiding in them. Avoiding the enemies, we should now collect the forest-rangers our friends and servants. O lord, this man is a Rākshasa by birth and the brother of our foe and so is he our enemy, how can we trust him? Rāvana's younger brother, known as Bibhishana, hath come here with four Rākshasas, to seek thy shelter. O thou the foremost of forgiving persons, I consider this Bibhishana, who hath been despatched by Rāvana, worthy of being slain. Being impelled by his wicked intention and commissioned by Rāvana, this Rākshasa hath come here and secretly by virtue of his illussive powers he shall slay thee, O innocent one, when thou shalt place confidence in him\". Having thus accosted Rāma, skilled in the art of speech, that lord of the army, Sugriva, well versed in speech, became silent. And hearing the words of Sugriva, the mighty Rāma spake unto the monkeys, near him, headed by Hanumān, saying,—\"Ye have all heard, the words well grounded in reason, the lord of monkeys hath said, regarding Rāvana's younger brother. It behoveth him, who desireth for perpetual wealth, and is intelligent and capable of giving sound counsels, to advise his friends in difficult matters\". Being thus addressed by Rāma (to minister unto him best counsels) all those monkeys, intent upon encompassing his well-being, gave out their respective opinions. \"O Rāghava, there is nothing beyond thy knowledge in the three worlds. It is only to show thy respect towards us, O Rāma, that thou dost accost us in this wise. Thou art of truthful vows, heroic, pious, of firm prowess, discriminating, recollecting and having implicit confidence in thy friends. Let the intelligent and capable counsellors deliver their reasonable opinions unto thee\". They speaking thus unto Rāghava, the intelligent monkey Angada, spoke as follows for sounding the intention of Bibhishana,—\"We should always suspect him since he has come from the side of our enemies, and should not, all on a sudden, place confidence in him. The wicked-minded always move about hiding their real self, and bring about peoples' calamity, taking advantage of their weak points. And great is the disaster thereof. It is always proper to engage in actions, considering what is right and what is wrong. Virtues should always be gathered and vices abandoned. Do thou renounce him unhesitatingly, if dost thou find in him a source of a great calamity and do thou embrace him if dost thou find him crowned with many virtues\". Thereupon followed Sarava with words fraught with high import,—\"O best of men, do thou speedily despatch emissaries to sound Bibhishana. If dost thou, sounding him well through the instrumentality of sharp spies, find him friendly, do thou win him over to thy side\". Thereupon the wise Jāmbavān, arriving at conclusions by virtue of his knowledge of Sastras, began with words, void of defects,—\"Surely doth Bibhishana come from the vicious lord of Rākshasas, dead set against us and hath arrived at such a bad place and in such a bad hour. We should always fear him\". And thereupon followed Mainda, conversant with what is right and wrong, after due deliberation, with words pregnant with reason,—\"He is Rāvana's younger brother, by name Bibhishana. Let the lord of men ask him every thing at first in sweet words. Do thou first ascertain, O foremost of men, with what intention he hath come—evil or good—and then settle what course to adopt\". Thereupon spake Hanumān, the foremost of the counsellors and well versed in Sastras, in accents sweet, glorious and fraught with a high value,—\"Even Vrihaspati, (the lord of speech) cannot excell thee, capable,44 gifted with the best of intellect and foremost of those skilled in the art of speech, as thou art. And what I know I speak, O king. I do so, in the interest of Rāma's work and not impelled by my skill in the art of speech, by the pride of being a counsellor, by the vanity of being gifted with a high intellect or by the desire of speaking for its own sake. What thy counsellors have said for ascertaining the good or evil intention of Bibhishana appeareth to me as most defective and productive of no consequence whatever. It is impossible to sound him without any command.45 And even to command him now for the same appears to me as improper. And as regards the despatch of spies, anent what thou hast been advised by thy ministers, I do not observe any utility. And what little I have thought of, I have something to say (regarding Jāmbavān's proposal) that Bibhishana hath arrived at such a bad place and in such an evil hour. He has really come to a very good place and in a very good hour. And truly has he performed a becoming and sensible action by coming here after duly ascertaining that Rāvana is a vicious wight and thou art a pious person—he is full of vices—thou art gifted with many virtues—he is tyrranical and thou art powerful. And what they hate said, O king, as regards sounding him through secret spies, appears to me as one requiring great wisdom. An intelligent man, when questioned by any suddenly, suspects many things. And if the new-comer be a friend and has come here for his own happiness, how greatly shall his mind be changed by such a course? Besides by a sudden questioning it is impossible to ascertain the intention of a foreigner. Do thou therefore thyself accost him and determine, by his voice, his secret motive. I did not however mark anything of his wickedness while he spoke; rather I did observe signs of gladness on his countenance. So I do not suspect him. The wily can never come fearless and undisturbed. Nor were his words cunning. So I do not suspect him. It is not very easy to hide one's real nature. It manifests itself by force. So this action of Bibhishana is not out of place or season. When accomplished it shall redound to his own interest. Considering well thy preparations for war and Rāvana's vain conduct, hearing of Vāli's destruction and Sugriva's installation on the throne, he hath, impelled by his good sense, come here, desirous of gaining the kingdom. Taking these into account, it seems prudent to take him to our side. O thou the foremost of the intelligent, I have spoken thus considering him sincere. It now behoveth thee to perform what thou thinkest proper\"."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Hearing those words of the Wind-god's son, the irrepressible Rāma, conversant with all the Sāstras, replied, with words expressing his own opinion—\"I have also thought of some thing regarding Bibhishana. I wish you all, interested in my well-being, to hear that. (Bibhishana) hath come here as a friend so I cannot forsake him by any means. And even if he has come with any evil intent it is not culpable for the pious to afford him shelter\". Thereupon hearing his words and considering them well, Sugriva, the lord of the monkeys, replied in more auspicious46 words,—\"Whether this ranger of the night is sincere or wicked, he should never be offered any shelter, since he hath forsaken his brother in the midst of these calamities. What reason is there to believe that he shall not renounce us in our difficulty?\" Hearing the words of the lord of monkeys and casting his looks towards them, Kākutstha, having truth for his prowess, smiling a little, spake, unto Lakshmana, crowned with all the marks of piety, saying—\"Without being conversant with Sastras, and living in the company of old men, none can speak such words as have been uttered by the king of the monkeys. There appear unto me, however two subtler reasons anent the difference between brothers, amongst the kings—one is evident and another mundane. There are two classes of foes—one consisting of the members of the same line the other of the neighbours. And these generally bring about our misfortune whenever any opportunity presents itself. And it is for this that he hath come here. Those kinsmen, who do not think of one another's mischief, generally long for their respective well-being. But even such well-meaning relatives are feared by the kings. And hear, I shall relate, what the Sastras say regarding the weak points thou hast mentioned as to the advisability of taking the enemies to our side. We are not his kinsmen and this Rākshasa hath come here with a view to gain the kingdom. Even the Rākshasas are wise enough to ascertain the proper course—so we must take Bibhishana. If the brothers are confident and satisfied with each other they generally live together, or else they fear each other and ultimately engage in a tumultuous war. And there hath sprung up some difference with Rāvana and therefore Bibhishana hath come here. Nor are, O friend, all brothers like Bharata, all sons like me unto their father, all friends like thee\". Being thus addressed by Rāma, the highly wise Sugriva, along with Lakshmana, rose up and bending low his head, said—\"O thou the best of all forgiving persons, this night-ranger hath been despatched by Rāvana. I therefore think it better to kill him. Being impelled by his vicious sense that Rākshasa hath come here to slay us, O innocent one, when myself, thou and Lakshmana shall consider ourselves secure. Therefore the large-armed Bibhisana, the younger brother of the ruthless Rāvana, deserves to be slain along with his counsellors\". Having thus addressed (Rāma) the foremost of Raghu's race, skilled in art of speech, Sugriva, the lord of monkey host, equally versed in the art of speech, became silent. And hearing the words of Sugriva, and weighing them, Rāma again addressed the foremost of monkeys with more reasonable accents—\"Wicked or otherwise, whatever this night-ranger may be, he shall not be able to do me the least mischief. Pisachas, Dānavas, Yakshas or all the Rākshasas on earth,—I can slay them all, if I like, with the tips of my fingers, O thou the lord of monkeys. I have heard of a pigeon adoring and entertaining with its own flesh, an enemy who took its shelter. While a pigeon received so friendly its enemy, the slayer of its mate, how can I then act otherwise, O foremost of the monkeys? Do thou hear, I shall relate, a sacred story, narrated by the great ascetic, the truthful Kandu, son of the ascetic Kanya. O slayer of foes, even a wicked-minded enemy, if he, with folded palms and a poor heart, craveth for thy shelter, should not be slain. If an enemy, proud or terrified, seeketh shelter in affright, he should be saved by a great man even at the risk of his own life. One, who from fear, ignorance or wilfully doth not protect him who seeketh his shelter, perpetrateth a mighty iniquity, blamed of all. When a person is slain before him whose shelter he hath taken he taketh away all the virtues of his protector. So great is the sin in not affording shelter unto those who seek for it; it standeth in the way of going to heaven, bringeth in calumny and destroyeth the strength and prowess. I shall therefore follow the excellent words of Kandu—leading to piety, fame and the attainment of the abode of the celestials. I always declare 'no fear' unto all creatures, whenever any, approaching me, says, 'I am thine' and seeketh my shelter. Even this is my pious observance. O Sugriva, O foremost of monkeys, do thou soon bring him here, whether he be Rāvana or Bibhishana and I shall declare unto him 'no fear'. Hearing the words of Rāma, Sugriva, the lords of those who go bounding, over-flowing with friendliness, bespake Kākutstha.—\"What wonder is there that thou wouldst speak these auspicious words, O thou the foremost of kings, conversant with morality, gifted with prowess and ever treading the pious track as thou art. Truly doth my inner self regard Bibhisana as devoid of any wicked intention. He has been well sounded by signs and gestures. And let the greatly wise Bibhisana, Rāghava, be placed on an equal footing with us and gain our friendship\". Hearing the words of Sugriva, the lord of monkeys, the king of men (Rāma) made instantly friends with Bibhisana, like unto the conqueror of enemies' cities making friends with the king of birds."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Raghava thus declaring unto him 'no fear', Rāvana's younger brother, the greatly wise Bibhisana, bending low his head, cast his looks on the earth. And descending from the welkin with his devoted attendants the virtuous-souled Bibhisana, delighted, bowed unto Rāma. And thereupon touching his feet along with four Rākshasas, Bibhisana addressed Rāma,—with words, fraught with piety, befitting the occasion and conducing to pleasure. \"I am Rāvana's younger brother and have been greatly insulted by him, I have therefore come to seek thy shelter, the refuge of all creatures, abandoning Lankā, and renouncing my friends and riches. My kingdom, life and happiness are all at thy disposal\". Hearing his words Rāma replied,—comforting him with words and favouring him as if with looks. \"Do thou relate unto me truly the strength and weakness of the enemies\". Being thus accosted by Rāma of unwearied actions, the Raksha, began to describe the strength of Rāvana. \"O prince, by virtue of the boon acquired from the Self-Create, the Ten-necked one is incapable of being slain by all creatures—Gandharbas, serpents, or birds. My elder brother—the one next to Rāvana—is the heroic and highly effulgent Kumbharkarna—Sakra's equal in battle. Thou mayst have heard, O Rāma, his commander is Prahasta, by whom was defeated Manibhadra on the mount Kailāça. (His son) Indrajit, equipped with invincible armour, bow and finger-protector made of the skin of iguana, becomes invisible in fight. And, worshipping Fire and becoming invisible, that graceful hero, O Rāghava, slayeth the enemies in conflict, having the contending parties vast and well arranged. Mahodara, Mahāpārcwa and the Rākshasa, Akampana, are his lieutenants, who equal the Lokapālas47 in battle. His army consists of ten thousand kotis of Rākshasas, wearing shapes at will, inhabiting the city of Lankā, and living on flesh and gore. And with the Lokapālas and the celestials, they were all defeated by the vicious-souled Rāvana\". Hearing the words of Bibhisana and weighing them in his mind, that foremost of Raghu's race said—\"I understand well the strength and prowess of Rāvana, which thou hast depicted truly, O Bibhisana. Do thou hear truly that I shall slay the Ten-necked one together with Prahasta and his sons, and I shall make thee king. Whether he entereth the Rasātala48 or the regions under the earth, or seeketh shelter of the Grand-father of the celestials, he shall not be able to save his life from me. I do swear by my three brethern that I shall enter the city of Ayodhyā, after slaying in battle Rāvana with his sons, kinsmen and friends\". Hearing these words of Rāma of unwearied action, the virtuous-souled (Bibhisana), bowing his head unto him, began—\"I shall lend thee my might in slaying the Rākshasas and devastating the city of Lankā, and shall be in the midst of Rāvana's army\". Thereupon, embracing Bibhisana, who spoke thus, Rāma, delighted, said unto Lakshmana,—\"O my brother, do thou bring water from the ocean. Sprinkling the greatly wise Bibhisana, I shall make him at once the king of the Rākshasas, O conferer of honor; for I am greatly pleased with him\". Being thus addressed, Saumitri, at the command of the king, annointed Bibhisana and made him the king of the Rākshasas in the presence of the monkey-host. Beholding Rāma's kindness (towards Bibhisana), the monkeys eulogized the high-souled one, exclaiming \"Excellent! Excellent!\" Thereupon, Hanumān and Sugriva addressed Bibhisana, saying, \"Do thou tell us how we shall cross over the main—the abode of Varuna, along with the host of the highly powerful monkeys. Do thou inform us of the means by which we may cross over, along with our army, the lord of rivers and streams—the abode of Varuna\". Being thus addressed, the virtuous-souled Bibhisana replied,—\"It behoveth the king, Rāghava, to seek refuge from the Ocean. This measureless deep was dug out by (the king) Sagara.49 And the great Ocean shall surely help Rāma belonging to Sagara's race\". Being thus accosted by the wise Rākshasa, Bibhishana. Sugriva reached where Rāma with Lakshmana was. Thereupon, the broad-necked Sugriva began to explain the well-meaning words of Bibhishana, requesting Rāma to seek the shelter of the Ocean. And those words pleased Rāma, pious by nature. And the highly eflulgent (hero) requested, smiling, the active Lakshmana and the monkey-chief Sugriva to collect necessaries for his adoration. \"O Lakshmana, this counsel of Bibhisana appeareth to me as most sound. Sugriva is always greatly wise, and thou art greatly proficient in counsel. Do ye, holding a conference, intimate to me what you think becoming\". Thus addressed, those two heroes—Lakshmana and Sugriva, spoke respectfully the following words fraught with propriety,—\"Why shall not the well-meaning words of Bibhisana expressed now, please us, O Rāghava, O thou best of men? Without constructing a bridge over the deep, the terrible abode of Varuna, even the celestials and their lord (Indra) cannot get at the city of Lankā. Do thou act on the genuine counsel of the heroic Bibhisana, and without losing time, do thou engage the Ocean for this work, so that we may with our army proceed to the city of Rāvana\". Being thus addressed Rāma reached the shore of the lord of rivers and streams, covered with Kuça, like unto fire getting into the sacrificial dais."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Thereupon the greatly powerful Rākshasa, by name Sārdula, beheld the army of Sugriva arranged on the shore of the ocean. And, beholding the army all busy, the emissary of the vicious-souled Rākshasa—Rāvana, entered the city of Lankā and, approaching his lord, said,—\"The army of monkeys and bears hath approached Lankā. It is immeasurably deep as the ocean. And those two sons of the king Daçaratha—the brothers Rāma and Lakshmana, gifted with great beauty, coming to rescue Sitā, have stationed themselves on the shore of the ocean, O thou of great effulgence. The army of Rāma extends over the sky and ten yojanas. I have come, O great king, to acquaint thee with the real truth. And, knowing everything, it behoveth thy emissaries, O king, to settle whether to render back Sitā, to adopt measures of conciliation, or to sow dissensions in the enemy's camp\". Hearing the words of Sārdula, Rāvana, the lord of Rākshasas, being anxious to ascertain his duty, addressed a Rākshasa by name Suka, the most sensible of his counsellors, with the following pregnant words,—\"Do thou go and communicate unto king Sugriva my behest, in becoming and excellent accents. 'Thou art born of a great family and art the mighty son of the king of bears. I have no dissension with thee. In fact I consider thee as my brother, O king of monkeys. Though I have stolen the spouse of the high-souled prince (Rāma), yet what is that to thee, O Sugriva? Do thou return to Kishkindhā. The monkeys shall not by any means be able to attack the city of Lankā. Even the celestials and Gandharbas could not—what of these men and monkeys?'\" And being thus commissioned by the lord of Rākshasas, that night-ranger assumed the shape of a bird and, bounding, speedily reached the sky. And, proceeding far over the deep and stationing himself at the welkin, he spoke unto Sugriva all the words with which he was addressed by the vicious-souled Rāvana. Hearing him speak thus, the monkeys leaped up quickly and reached there with a view to chop off his wings or to slay him with their clenched fists. On being seized vehemently by all these monkeys, that night-ranger was brought down speedily from the sky to the earth. And being assailed by the monkeys, Suka said,—\"O Kākutstha, it doth not behove (people) to slay an emissary. Do thou therefore prevent the monkeys. He who passing by his master's behest, giveth out his own intention, is not faithful; and he therefore deserveth to be slain\". Hearing the piteous accents of Suka, Rāma spake unto the monkeys, who were about to kill him, saying, \"Do not kill him\". And again stationing himself on the welkin, that night-ranger said,—\"O Sugriva, O thou gifted with great energy, O thou of great prowess, what shall I speak unto Rāvana, dreaded by all people?\" Being thus addressed, that mighty king of monkeys, the bull among them, of unwearied energy, spake unto that emissary—the night-ranger, Suka, saying—\"O Rāvana, thou art not my friend or an object of pity. Thou art not my benefactor, nor art liked by me. Thou art Rāma's enemy, and thou dost therefore deserve to be slain by him like Vāli along with thy friends and relatives. I shall therefore slay thee, O king of night-rangers, together with thy sons, friends and relatives. And I shall have the whole city of Lankā reduced to ashes by my mighty force. Thou shalt not be able to escape Rāghava, O Rāvana, O thou who hast lost thy sense, even if thou art protected by the celestials. And thou shalt with thy brother be slain by Rāma, even if thou dost fly into the sky, enter into the regions under the earth, or seek shelter of Mahadeva. I do not behold any in these three worlds—Pisācha, Rākshasa, Gandharba, or Asura, who can protect thee. Thou hast slain the monarch of vultures, who had grown decrepit through age.50 Thou hast carried off the large-eyed Sitā from the vicinity of Rāma and the neighbourhood of Lakshmana; but, having captured her, thou understandest not (thy native strength). Nor dost thou understand that foremost of Rāghus, high-souled, possessed of great strength, and incapable of being repressed even by the celestials,—who shall take thy life\". Then spake that best of monkeys, Angada, son of Vāli,—\"O highly wise one, this is no emissary. This one clearly appeareth to me as a spy. He hath come to form an estimate of thy entire army. Take him. Let him not go (back) to Lankā. This is indeed what I would\". Thereat, commanded by the king, the monkeys, springing up, seized (Suka) and bound him, as he burst out bewailing like one forlorn. On being sorely handled by the relentless monkeys, Suka cried unto tho high-souled Rāma, son of Daçaratha,—\"They by main force sever my wings, and they pierce my eyes. If I lose my life, may all the evil deeds that I have committed between the night when I was born and the night when I shall die, be thine!\" Hearing this pitiful cry, Rāma prevented (the monkeys); and he said unto them,—\"Let go this envoy, who hath come here\"."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Then on the shore of the sea, Rāghava, spreading darbha, with his hands joined towards the great deep, laid him down, with his face to the East. And that slayer of foes (lay down), making his pillow his arm resembling the shining form of a serpent; always dight with golden ornaments; full many a time pressed with the palms of beauteous damsels,51 decked with jewelled golden Keyuras and superb ornaments studded with pearls; smeared from above with sandal and aguru; (his arm) which formerly had been graced in bed with the head of Sitā; like unto the body of Takshaka under the waters of the Gangā; resembling a yoke; in battle increasing the sorrow of foes and enhancing for long the delight of friends;—his left arm having its skin destroyed by the strokes of the bow-string; which was the refuge of the entire earth;—his right arm resembling a mighty bludgeon,—the donor of thousands of kine,—making this great arm his pillow (he laid him down). \"To-day either I shall die, or shall the Ocean\".—Having thus formed his resolution in respect of the great deep, Rāma, restraining his speech, with a concentrated mind lay down there agreeably to rule. And as Rāma slept on the earth on Kuça spread over, without ever swerving from the rule, three nights passed away. And while spending three nights, Rāma, learned in polity and attached to virtue, prayed unto that lord of streams—the Ocean. Yet the wicked Ocean, albeit adored according to his deserts by Rāma with his mind concentrated, did not show himself. Thereat Rāma grew enraged and had the corners of his eyes crimsoned; and he spake unto Lakshmana of auspicious marks, saying,—\"Behold the hauteur of the Ocean in not presenting himself before me. Calmness, forbearance, candour, and soft speech—these virtues of the good are by the insolent taken for the effects of incompetency. The person52 that is self-laudatory, wicked, and badly-bold, publisheth his own praise, and meteth out chastisement every where,53 is honored in the world. By moderation one cannot attain celebrity, by moderation one cannot attain fame,—and, O Lakshmana, in this world by moderation one cannot attain victory on 'the edge of battle.'54 See, O Sumitrā's son, the abode of Makaras, with his waters obstructed all around with Makaras destroyed by my shafts. And, O Lakshmana, see the bodies here of serpents, and the huge bodies of mighty fishes, and the trunks of elephants,—torn by my arrows. And to-day in terrible battle will I dry up the Ocean with conchs and oysters, and fishes and Makaras. This abode of Makaras taketh me, who is forbearing, to be incompetent. Fie on forbearance towards such as he! In consequence of my moderation, Ocean showeth not his own form. O Saumitri, bring thou my bow, my arrows resembling venomous snakes. I will dry up the Ocean, and the monkeys shall go over on foot. And, being angered, to-day, albeit incapable of being agitated, will I agitate the deep. And by means of my shafts will I make Varuna's abode, surging with a thousand billows and having his dignity maintained by his shores,—overleap his continents. And I will agitate the deep harbouring numbers of mighty Dānavas\". Having spoken thus, Rāma, equipped with his bow, with his eyes dilated in wrath, became exceedingly irrepressible, like unto the flaming fire at the final dissolution. And straining his dreadful bow, making the earth shake, tremulously, he let fly fierce shafts like him of an hundred sacrifices hurling his thunder-bolt. Thereat, flaming up, those vehement choice shafts surcharged with energy, enter into the waters of the sea, with its serpents afflicted with fear. And then great and exceedingly dreadful was the motion of the sea, with fishes and Makaras, and with the roar of the winds (blowing there). And on a sudden the mighty deep was heaving with mighty surges, with conchs scattered about, and a smoke (enveloped) the ocean; and the billows became visible on all sides. And the serpents were distressed, with their faces flaming and their eyes aglow; as well as the Dānavas of terrific energy, and the dwellers of the nether spheres. And billows of the sovran Ocean, resembling Vindhya or Mandara, containing crocodiles and Makaras sprang up by thousands. And Varuna's abode had its surges whirling, its serpents and Rākshasas seized with affright, and its ferocious aquatic animals borne all around; and it sent forth sounds. Then Sumitrā's son, springing up, said unto Rāghava of fiery vehemence, as he sighed and kept stretching his matchless bow.—\"This must not be\". And he took away his (Rāma's) bow. \"Without doing this unto the Ocean, thou, supreme of heroes, mayst have thy work accomplished. Personages like thee do not come under the influence of passion. Do thou deliberately look about for some worthy means (for compassing thy end)\". Then remaining invisible in the sky, Brahmarshis and Surarshis55 exclaiming,—\"Well-a-day!\" and \"Don't,\" in loud accents ejaculated,—(Oh! and alas!)"

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Then the foremost of Raghus addressed Ocean in stern words, saying,—\"To-day will I dry up the Ocean along with the nether regions. And, O Ocean, thy waters being burnt up by my shafts, and thou being dried up, with thy (aquatic) animals slaughtered, a mighty volume of dust shall arise (from thy bed). And, O Ocean, in consequence of the arrowy shower discharged from my bow, the monkeys shall go over to the further shore on foot. Having attained dimensions in consequence of access of waters, thou knowest not my manliness or my prowess But, O abode of Dānavas, grief shalt thou reap at my hands\". Then fixing an arrow resembling the rod of Brahmā with a Brahma Mantra, on the best of bows, that exceedingly strong one drew it. And as Rāghava suddenly stretched his bow, heaven and earth seemed to be riven, and the mountains trembled. And darkness covered the world, and the cardinal points became invisible. And at once the watery expanses and rivers were agitated. And the stars appeared simultaneously with the Sun and Moon.56 And the sky was illumined with the rays of the Sun, and yet it was overspread with darkness; and it burned with an hundred meteors. And thunder-bolts sending forth sounds surpassing all others, dropped from the firmament. And the winds began to blow violently; breaking down trees and momentarily scattering clouds; damaging mountain-tops and shattering summits. And then the dread and mighty thunders possessing impetuous speed and emitting tremendous roars,—coming together, produced lightning flashes. And those creatures that could be seen, uttered sounds resembling the thunder; and those that were invisible gave forth frightful cries. And overwhelmed with fright, and quaking (for fear), the creatures began to measure their lengths,—and they were sore afflicted, and bereft of motion through terror. And then the mighty deep with its animals, and with its waters and waves, and with its serpents and Rākshasas, was suddenly wrought up with a violent motion. And albeit it was not the occasion of the universal dissolution, the Ocean passed beyond his shores for a full hundred yojanas. And seeing the elated Ocean—lord of streams and rivers—thus overpass his bounds, that destroyer of enemies, Raghu's son, Rāma, was not moved.57 Then from forth the mid-sea arose Ocean himself, even as the maker of day riseth from the mighty ascending-hill, Meru. And accompanied by Pannagas58 of flaming faces, the Ocean showed himself, appearing like cool lapises, adorned with golden ornaments,—wearing a wreath of gems and a jewelled vesture, with his eyes resembling lotus-leaves, bearing on his head a noble garland containing all flowers; decked with ornaments of polished gold; as well with excellent ornaments of gems originating in himself, like the mountain Himavān embellished with metals (sprung in himself),—(the Ocean arose) with wave on wave whirling around, and rife with winds blowing among clouds,—surrounded by streams, Ganga, Sindhu (and others). And approaching the arrow-showering Rāma, and greeting him fair, Ocean spoke unto him with joined hands,—\"O Rāghava, earth, air, sky, water and light,—these, O mild one, retaining their eternal course, maintain their (respective) natures. Mine also is that nature whereby I am fathomless and incapable of being crossed. The reverse of this is the having a bottom. And for this reason I speak to thee (concerning the means). O king's son, not from desire, or covetuousness, or fear, or anger, can I anywise deprive my waters abounding in alligators of their (perpetual) motion. I will tell thee how thou wilt pass (over me); and I will bear it. And no ferocious aquatic animals shall do wrong so long as thy forces have not crossed. And, O Rāma, I will make as it were firm land for the crossing over of the monkeys\". Then Rāma said,—\"O Varuna's abode, listen to me! This arrow (of mine) must accomplish the end (intended). Where shall I let it light?\" Hearing Rāma's speech, and looking at the mighty arrow, that exceedingly energetic one, the great Deep, addressed Rāghava, saying,—\"There is a certain spot of mine in the North, which is more sacred (than the rest). It is famed as Drumakulya, even as thou art famed in the world. There are there many robbers of ferocious forms and actions,—wicked wights, headed by cow-herds,—who drink of my water. These persons of unrighteous acts touch me, and I cannot bear this sin. O Rāma, do thou at that place render this best of arrows successful\". Hearing the words of the high-souled Ocean, (Rāma) immediately after,59 let fly that flaming shaft. And the place where the arrow resembling the thunder-bolt and vajra in splendour, alighted, hath been celebrated on earth as Marukāntāra. And hurt with the dart, the Earth emitted roars; and in consequence of this, water began to gush out at the mouth of the wound from the subterranean regions. And this then became well-known as Vrana; and there are seen the waters of the Ocean spring up. And there arose a terrific report of riving. And owing to this,60 as well as the incident of the arrow, the water that existed in the tanks, was dried up. Having dried up Marukāntāra famous throughout the three regions, as well as the reservoirs of water, Rāma the son of Daçaratha, learned and of god-like prowess, conferred a boon on the desert, saying,—\"This place shall be filled with food nourishing beasts; and ailments shall be rare here. And the fruits and roots shall be replete with relish; and it shall abound in oil and overflow with milk; and it shall contain various odorous drugs\". Thus did the desert come to possess these attributes; and from Rāma's bestowal of a boon, it attained a pleasant aspect. On that place being burnt up, that lord of streams, the Ocean, thus spake unto Rāghava, versed in every branch of learning,—\"O mild one, this one is named Nala, son unto Viçwakarmā. He hath received a boon from his sire. Viçwakarmā's son is well pleased with thee. Let this monkey, surcharged with exhuberant spirits, build a bridge over me. I will hold that up. This one is as his sire\". Having delivered himself thus, Ocean disappeared. Then that foremost of monkeys, Nala, arising, spoke unto the mighty Rāma,—\"Resorting to my sire's skill, I will build a bridge over the spacious abode of Makaras. The mighty Ocean hath spoken justly. In respect of the ingrate even chastisement is supreme in this world,—this is my conviction. Down with forbearance, or moderation, or gift! This dreadful Ocean, this mighty deep, expecting to see a bridge (thrown over him), hath granted depth unto Rāghava.—(Formerly) is Mandara, Viçwakarmā had conferred a boon on my mother: 'O exalted one, thy son shall be like me.' I am a son of his, sprung from his loins, and I am like unto Viçwakarmā. Not having been asked by thee, I had not unfolded my qualifications. I also am capable of constructing a bridge over Varuna's abode. Therefore this very day let the foremost monkeys construct the bridge\". Then directed by Rāma, the principal monkeys with alacrity entered the mighty forest in hundrerds and thousands. And themselves resembling mountains, the foremost of the monkeys began to break down and draw them towards the Ocean. And the monkeys filled the Ocean with sālas, and açwakarnas, dhavas, bamboos kutajas, arjunas, palms, tilakas, tiniças, billakas, aparnas, and blossoming karnikāras, mangoes, and a trees. And those monkeys—the foremost of their species—began to gather the trees, some with their roots, some without them,—carrying them like Indra's ensign. And those huge-bodied monkeys possessed of prodigious strength, procured palms and pomegranates, cocoanuts and itakas, Kariras, Vakulas, and Nimbas,—as well as rocks. Measuring elephants' dimensions; and uprooting crags, they tossed them by means of machines. And on rocks being plunged into the waters, the latter, suddenly swelling up, mounted to the welkin, and again subsided.—And (the trees) dropping (into the deep), vexed it all around. And some made lines (for insuring straightness unto the bridge). And in the middle of the lord of rivers and streams, Nala made a grand bridge measuring an hundred yojanas. And then he went about constructing the bridge with the assistance of monkeys of dreadful deeds. And some took the measuring and others bore (timber to the sea). And by help of hundreds of monkeys following Rāma's mandate, hued like woods or mountains, (they) constructed a bridge with grass, and wood. And the monkeys made the bridge of trees with blossoming tops. And (monkeys) resembling Dānavas were rushing all around with rocks resembling hills, and mountain-summits. And tremendous was the tumult that came of crags thrown and rocks toppled down into the mighty deep. And on the first day the elephant-like monkeys of spirits and exerting themselves vigorously, finished fifteen yojanas. And the exceedingly strong and huge-bodied monkeys on the second day speedily disposed of twenty yojanas. And on the third day the huge-bodied active monkeys did one and twenty yojanas on the sea. And on the fourth day the exceedingly impetuous monkeys, bestirring themselves vigorously, did two and twenty yojanas. And On the fifth day the fast-speeding monkeys accomplished three and twenty yojanas reaching unto the fair shore. And resembling his sire, that best of monkeys, the lusty and graceful offspring of Viçwakarmā, (thus) constructed the bridge over the sea. And that bridge built by force over the abode of makaras, looked graceful and splendid like the Milky way in the firmament. And then the deities and Gandharbas, the Siddhas and the prime saints, appearing in the heavens, stood there, eager to behold this wonder. And the gods and Gandharbas saw that bridge of Nala, difficult of being made, having an area of ten yojanas and measuring an hundred in length. And the monkeys, leaping and bounding and roaring, as well as all creatures, beheld that building of the bridge on the ocean, inconceivable, and marvellous, displaying skill past thought and capable of making one's hair stand on end. And those thousands of Kotis of exceeding vigor, having constructed the bridge over the ocean, went over to the other shore of the mighty main. And spacious, skillfully constructed, graceful, well-paved and nicely finished, the great bridge appeared like the line where the hair hath been parted on the Ocean's head. Then on the other shore of the ocean, Bibhishana, with the view of opposing foes (that might advance), stationed himself mace in hand, along with some councilors. Then Sugriva spoke unto Rāma, having truth for his prowess,—\"Do thou get upon Hanumān, and let Laskhmana get upon Angada. O hero, vast is this Ocean—abode of Makaras. These monkeys, rangers of the sky, shall hold you up both\". Thereat the graceful and righteous Rāma along with Lakshmana, equipped with his bow, set out in the van of the army in company with Sugriva. And some monkeys proceeded along the middle, and some plunged into the deep, and some went by the road. And some coursed through the air, bounding up bird-like. And that dreadful array of monkeys crossing over, with its mighty uproar drowned the dreadful roar of the deep, which had been arising. On the monkey-host having crossed by the bridge of Nala, the king stationed it on the shore abounding in fruits, roots and water. Beholding that work of Rāghava incapable of being performed, the deities together with the Siddhas and Charanas, and the Maharshis, suddenly presenting themselves before Rāma, sprinkled him one by one with sacred water, and said,—\"Mayst thou be victorious, O human-divine one! Rule thou the Earth eternally!\" Thus in various auspicious words, did they pay homage unto that one honored by the Brahmanas, Rāma."

Mighty is the fear that I see at hand,—boding destruction to people and the slaughter of the foremost heroes of bears, monkeys and Rākshasas. The wind bloweth darkly, and the Earth shaketh. The tops of the mountains tremble, and trees topple down. And the clouds are ashen and roistering, and roar roughly. And lowering, they shower portentous drops of blood. And the twilight is terrible and looketh like the red sandal. And a fiery circle droppeth from the flaming sun. And on all sides birds and beasts, distressed, uttering woe-begone notes, and grim-visaged, set up crying against the sun, arousing great fear. And the Moon, although not appearing61 in the night, burneth, and with dark and red rays riseth, as if it intended to exterminate people. And the aspect (of the sun) is slight, rough, and not good;62 and, O Lakshmana, a blue mark is visible on the unclouded Sun. And the stars seem erased by a mighty volume of dust. O Lakshmana, behold this sight disastrous to people like unto the universal dissolution. Crows, and hawks, and the inferior vultures, wheel all round. And jackals are sending inauspicious yells, exciting great fear. The earth shall be covered with darts and javelins, and swords discharged by monkeys and Rākshasas, and then turned into mire with flesh and gore. Surrounded by all these monkeys, will we, using speed, this very day rapidly enter into the city ruled by Rāvana, incapable of being subdued. Having said this, that subduer in conflict, that lord, the enchanter of men, Rāma,63 equipped with his bow, proceeds in the direction of Lankā. And all the principal monkeys— Sugriva with Bibhishana—went on, setting up roars, for the destruction of foes, who were determined to battle with them. And consequently Raghu's son was well pleased with the fortitude and exertions of the powerful monkeys, for bringing about what was dear unto Rāghava."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "And with the presence of the king64 that assembly of heroes looked beautiful, as doth the autumnal night, garnished with beauteous stars, with the Moon. And oppressed with the bursting energy of the host resembling the ocean, the Earth trembled. And then the rangers of the forest heard a hubbub in Lankā, as well as the sounds of trumpets and Mridangas, mighty and capable of making people's down stand on end. And at those sounds, the leaders of monkey-bands were delighted beyond measure, and, resenting the same, set up cries louder than those sounds. And the Rākshasas also heard the roars of the monkeys, resembling the rumbling of haughty clouds in the sky. Beholding Lankā with variegated standards, and streamers, Daçaratha's son went65 to Sitā with an aggrieved heart. \"Here that one having eyes resembling those of a young deer, is confined by Rāvana, like unto Rohini overpowered by the red-bodied planet\".66 And, sighing hot and long, and looking at Lakshmana, that hero spoke words fraught with his good at that time—\"Behold, O Lakshmana, Lankā towering up as if piercing the heavens; and, built by Viçwakarmā on the brow of the mountain, she seems to have been made by the Mind. Constructed in time past with edifices thronging her, Lankā looks like the all-encasing air, covered with pale clouds. Lankā is embellished with groves resembling Chitraratha, fair, and eloquent with the notes of various birds, and fraught with fruits and flowers. Behold the intoxicated birds, and the black bees blending (with the blossoms). And the blessed breeze swayeth the trees vocal with the coels\". Having divided his forces there agreeably to the directions of the scriptures, Daçaratha's son, Rāma, thus spoke unto Lakshmana. And he ordered that monkey-army, saying,—\"Taking his own forces, let the puissant and invincible Angada along with Nila, station himself in the centre of the forces. And let the monkey, named Rishabha, surrounded by numbers of monkeys, post himself at the right of the monkey-army. And let the active and irrepressible Gandhamādana, resembling an elephant fragrant with the temporal exudation, stay, occupying the left of the forces. I myself along with Lakshmana, shall needfully stay in the fore-front. And the monkeys, Jāmbavān, Sushena and Vagadarçi, the three high-souled, foremost bears,67—shall protect the interior (of the forces). And as the Sun, surcharged with energy, protects the hind half of the globe, let the monkey-monarch protect the rear of the monkey-army\". And that army being skilfully divided into parts and protected by great monkeys, resembled the welkin covered with clouds. Then, taking up mountain-peaks and mighty trees, the monkeys began to proceed towards Lankā burning to crush Lankā in battle. \"We shall demolish Lankā by hurling mountain-peaks, or with our clenched fists\". Thus did the foremost of monkeys think in their minds. Then the exceedingly energetic Rāma addressed Sugriva, saying,—\"Our forces have been rightly marshalled,—let go (now) Suka\". Hearing Rāma's words, the lord of monkeys possessed of great strength, liberated the envoy, Suka, at the command of Rāma. Liberated at the word of Rāma, Suka, who had been sore tormented by the monkeys, oppressed with exceeding great fear, went to the lord of Rākshasas. Thereat, Rāvana, laughing, said unto Suka,—\"Are thy wings fettered? And thou seemst as if thy wings had been severed. Why? Didst thou come under the control of the volatile (monkeys)?\" Thereat, exercised with fear, Suka, commanded by the monarch, answered the lord of Rākshasas in this excellent speech, saying,—\"Repairing to the northern shore of the sea, I, pacifying (the monkeys) with mild speech, communicated thy tidings clearly (unto Sugriva). Thereat, as soon as they saw me, the monkeys flying into a wrath, captured me, and attempted to clip my wings and slay me with their clenched fists. They are insuseptible of being spoken to. No doubt whatever can exist that, O lord of Rākshasas, the monkeys are by nature wrathful and fierce. The same Rāma that hath slain Virādha and Kavandha and Khara, hath arrived (here) along with Sugriva, searching for the whereabouts of Sitā. Having thrown a bridge across the brine and crossed the salt sea, Rāghava, equipped with his bow, stayeth here, setting the Rakshas at naught. And the hosts consisting of thousands of bears and monkeys, resembling hills and clouds, envelope the Earth. And peace there can be none between the forces of the Rākshasas and the hosts of the sovereign of monkeys, like unto the deities and the Dānavas. And they advance before the wall. Speedily do one of these things—make over Sitā without delay, or give (him) battle\". Hearing Suka's speech, Rāvana with his eyes reddened in wrath, spoke, as if burning (Suka) with them,—\"Even if gods, and Gandharbas, and Dānavas should array themselves against me, I will not from fear of all creatures, render (back) Sitā. When shall my shafts pursue Rāghava, like maddened Bhramaras making towards blossomy trees in spring? When by means of flaming shafts shot from my bow shall I burn (Rāghava) with his body bathed in blood, even as a meteor (burneth) an elephant? And when, surrounded by a mighty host, shall I confound his ranks, even as the Sun arising, (vanquisheth) the light of the stellar spheres? My impetuosity like the Ocean's, my strength like the Wind's, Dāçarathi doth not know,—and therefore it is that he desireth to fight with me. Rāma hath not seen my shafts resting in the quiver, resembling venomous serpents,—and therefore it is that he seeketh to fight with me. Rāghava hath not in conflict formerly known my bow representing my Vinā sounded with my shafts; having tremendous sounds proceeding from the strings; dreadful; with the cries of distressed people for its mighty strains of music; and resonant with the reports of Nārāchas and palms. And, having bathed in the great field of battle representing the river of hostile forces, I will in the encounter strike (this Vinā). Neither the thousand-eyed Vasava, nor Varuna himself, can (cope) with me in battle; nor can Yama, or Vaicravana's self vanquish me in mighty conflict with the fire of arrows\"."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "On Daçaratha's son, Rāma, having crossed the Ocean with his forces, the graceful Rāvana addressed his two counsellors, Suka and Sārana, saying,—\"The crossing the entire ocean incapable of being crossed, by the monkey-forces, and the building over the sea of the bridge by Rāma— all this had never happened before. The construction of a bridge over the ocean cannot at all command credence. But (however it be), I must enumerate the monkey-hosts. Entering the monkey-army unobserved, it behoveth you to ascertain the magnitude thereof, its strength, who are the foremost monkeys, who are the councilors assembled there of Rāma, and who of Sugriva, who range at the head, who among the monkeys are heroic; how they have constructed the bridge over the water of the ocean; how the high-souled monkeys stay there; Rāma's, as well as Lakshmana's purpose, prowess and the arms (they fight with). And who is the commander of those magnanimous monkeys? Having learnt all this truly, ye ought to return speedily\". Being thus commissioned, these heroes, the Rākshasas, Suka and Sārana, assuming monkey-shapes, entered into the hosts of monkeys. But Suka and Sārana could not number that army of monkeys, incomprehensible and capable of making people's hair stand on end. The forces were on mountain-tops, by fountains and in caves. And those rangers of the night beheld those forces, some having already crossed, and some crossing, and some intent on doing so; and some having sat down and some sitting—that mighty army sending terrific roars,—that ocean of hosts incapable of being disturbed. As they remained thus disguised, they were discovered by Vibhishana. Thereat, taking them captive, he unfolded (the fact) unto Rāma, saying,—\"These are the counsellors of the lord of Rākshasas—Suka and Sārana. O captor of hostile capitals, they have come as spies from Lankā\". Seeing Rāma, they were greatly afflicted, and, despairing of their lives and exercised with fear, with joined hands, said,—\"O placid one, commanded by Rāvana, we have come here, O son of Raghu, for the purpose of gathering information concerning this army\". Hearing their speech, Rāma—son unto Daçaratha—ever engaged in the welfare of all beings, laughing, remarked,—\"If you have heedfully noted this entire array, or if you have done what ye had been commanded to do, return in peace. If aught remaineth unseen, do ye see it anew. Or Vibhishana will again fully show it unto you. Having been taken, ye need not fear on the score of your lives. Even if envoys happen to be taken who are equipped with weapons, they should not be slain. And albeit these night-rangers have come as spies in disguise, with the view of creating division among their foes, yet, O Vibhishana, let them off. Entering the extensive Lankā, ye should say unto the king—younger brother unto the Dispenser of riches—the words which I utter,—'That force relying on which thou hast carried away my Sitā, do thou as thou wishest, along with thy forces and friends, display the same. On the morning of the morrow behold the city of Lankā with her wall and gates, as well as the hosts of Rākshasas, destroyed by me with my shafts. And as Vasava equipped with the thunder-bolt hurleth the same amidst the Dānavas, will I, O Rāvana, on the morning of the morrow pour down my dreadful ire upon thee along with thy forces.'\" Thus directed (by Rāma), those Rākshasas, Suka and Sārana, having saluted the righteous Rāghava with 'Victory!,' came (back) to Lankā and spoke unto the lord of Rākshasas, saying,—\"O lord of Rākshasas, having been taken by Vibhishana for the purpose of being slain, we came to be seen by the righteoua-souled Rāma of immeasurable energy, and (finally) were liberated (by him). As these four persons have combined—like unto the Lokapalas, heroic, accomplished in arms, and of steady prowess—viz., Daçaratha's son, Rāma, the graceful Lakshmana, Vibhishana, and the highly powerful Sugriva, resembling the great Indra, these are capable of uprooting the city of Lankā—walls and gateways—and replacing her (on her former site),—leave thou the monkeys aside. Such is Rāma's figure and arms that he shall alone demolish Lankā,—leave the other three alone. And that host protected by Rāma, Lakshmana and Sugriva, shall become exceedingly hard to combat even by the Asuras and gods.—And the army of the high-souled rangers of the woods, eager for encounter, contains warriors bursting with high spirits. No use of dispute. Be thou intent on pacification. Do thou render back Maithili unto Daçaratha's son\"."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Hearing Sārana's words, pregnant and truthful, king Rāvana addressed him, saying,—\"Even if the gods, Gandharvas and Dānavas should attack me, Sitā will I not part with from fear of all creatures. O amiable one, thou, having been hard handled by the monkeys and distressed in consequence, deemst it fit that Sitā should be rendered back this very day. What foe of mine is there who is competent to conquer me in battle?\" Having uttered this rough speech, the graceful Rāvana—lord of the Rākshasas—desirous of surveying (the monkey-hosts), ascended an edifice white like snow, and elevated like many palms (placed one upon another). And transported with passion, Rāvana in company with those spies, saw the sea, mountains and forests. And they beheld the Earth enveloped with monkeys, and the mighty host of monkeys, boundless and irresistible. And having seen this, king Rāvana asked Sārana,—\"Who among these monkeys are the foremost, who are the heroes, and who possessed of great strength? Who, bursting with spirits, stay all about the fore? Whom doth Sugriva listen to? And who are the leaders of the monkey-leaders? O Sārana, relate thou all this unto me. And what is the prowess of the monkeys?\" Thereat, Sārana, knowing the chiefs (of the monkey-army), spoke unto the sovereign of Rākshasas, who had asked (him), as to who were the heads of the rangers of the woods. \"This monkey, that, setting up roars, stayeth in front of Lankā, surrounded by hundreds and thousands of monkey-leaders, by whose tremendous shouts Lankā trembleth with her wall, gateways, hills, woods and forests, and who is posted in front of the forces of the high-souled Sugriva—master of all the monkeys—is the heroic leader of monkey-bands named Nila. And that one, possessed of prowess, who, folding up his arms, paceth the gound on foot, who, facing Lankā, from wrath is frequently yawning, who resembles a mountain-peak and is like the filaments of a lotus, who, enraged again and again soundeth his tail, and the ten cardinal points resound with the sounds of whose tail,—is he who hath been sprinkled by Sugriva—king of monkeys—the heir apparent, named Angada. He challengeth thee to the fight. The worthy son of Vāli and ever dear unto Sugriva, he putteth forth his prowess, as Varuna doth for Sakra. That that well-wisher of Rāghava, the vehement Hanumān, hath seen Janaka's daughter, was owing to the advice of this one. That powerful (hero) is proceeding, taking innumerable bands belonging to the lord of monkeys, for the purpose of beating thee by means of his soldiery. Following Vāli's son, and surrounded by a mighty force, stayeth in the field the heroic Nala, the builder of the bridge. Those that with their limbs lying inactive, and setting up roars and ululations, are following this one,68 are heroes dwelling in Chandana.69 With his own army alone, the silver-hued Sweta of dreadful prowess hopes to subdue Lankā. Marshalling his monkey-forces and cheering up his soldiers, that intelligent monkey, famed over the three regions, having speedily met with Sugriva, is retracing his steps. From days of yore on the banks of the Gomati there is a mountain, (named) Ramya, (otherwise) called Sanrochana. The mount abounds with various trees. There that leader of bands, named Kumuda, governs his kingdom. And he that cheerfully draweth after his hundreds and thousands of monkeys, and the long grim hairs of whose tail, coppery, yellow, sable and white, are cast about, is the energetic monkey, Chanda, eager for encounter. And he hopes to conquer Lankā by help of his own forces. And this one, resembling a lion, tawny and furnished with a long mane, who, remaining apart, vieweth all Lankā as if consuming her with his eyes, dwelleth for ever and a day in Vindhya, the mountain Krisha, Sahya, and the mount Sudarçana, and, a leader of bands, is named Rambha. Three hundred Kotis of the foremost of monkeys, dreadful and fierce and possessed of terrific prowess, surrounding (him) go in his wake for the purpose of demolishing Lankā by their (native) might. And he that expandeth his ears and yawneth again and again, who defieth the fear of death and doth not move his forces, who trembleth for wrath and eyeth frequently askance,—and behold the lashing of his tail!—and who setteth up leonine shouts, O king, with great energy and with fear cast off,—resideth in the romantic mount, Sālweya, and, a leader of companies, is named Sarabha. To him, O king, belong forty hundred thousands of powerful leaders. And he that stayeth, like unto a mighty mass of clouds covering up the sky, in the midst of the monkey-heroes, as doth Vāsava in the centre of the celestials, whose lofty shout is heard (mingled with) the uproar set up by the foremost monkeys, burning for battle, dwelleth in the excellent hill Pārijātra; and, ever irrepressible in fight, is named Panaça, a leader of (monkey)-bands. Fifty lacs of leaders with their forces arranged, environ this commander of monkeys. He that stayeth gracing the dreadful array overflowing with talk, stationed on the shore of the ocean,—resembling a second sea and like unto Durdara70—is the leader named Vitata. And he rangeth, drinking of (the waters of) the Venā,—best among streams—and his forces are sixty lacs of monkeys. And the monkey, named Krathana, challengeth thee to conflict. He hath (under him) powerful and vigorous generals, and forces well divided. And the monkey owning that person of the hue of red chalk, and, who, elated with strength, disregardeth all the monkeys,—is named Gavaya, who approacheth thee wrathfully. Several lacs (of troops) girt him round; and by their means he has to bring down Lankā. These are the heroes, incapable of being borne, whose numbers cannot be enumerated. These are the leaders and the heads thereof, as well as the forces set in order of battle\"."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "As thou lookest on, I shall describe unto thee the leaders who shall put forth their prowess for Rāghava, lay down their lives (in his behalf.) That one of dread deeds the long hairs on whose long tail, coppery, and yellow, and black, and white, thrown up, look like the rays of Sun, and are trailing over the ground, is the monkey, named Hara; whom follow hundreds and thousands (of monkeys) desperately upraising trees, intent upon (scaling) Lankā—leaders of the monkey-king and his servants present (in that conflict.) And these whom thou beholdest present, resembling mighty masses of sable clouds, like unto black collyrium, of genuine prowess, countless and incapable of enumeration dwelling in mountains, provinces, and rivers,—terrible beings—approach thee, O king. In their amidst is their king, gray eyed and of fierce appearance, like unto Parjanya71 encompassed by clouds,—who dwelleth in that best of mountains, Rikkhavān, drinking of the Narmadā.—Behold this one resembling a hill—younger brother of Dhumra, lord of the bears. He is equal to his brother in beauty, and of superior prowess. This leader of redoubtable leaders named Jāmbavān. He is mild, obedient to his superiors and fierce in fight. The intelligent Jāmbavān assisted Sakra signally in the war of the gods and Asuras, and he hath won many boons (in consequence). Ascending the tops of mountains, these hurl down gigantic crags huge as colossal clouds, nor doth (the fear of) death (ever) disquiet them. And their bodies covered with hair, they resemble Rākshasas and ghosts (in their conduct). This one of immeasurable energy hath innumerable troops going about, who behold this leader of leaders under unusual excitement leaping and resting (by turns). This lord of monkeys dwelleth near the thousand-eyed Deity; and this leader of bands, gifted with strength, is named Rambha. And he that going, toucheth with his side a mountain situated at the distance of a Yojana, and, rising up, measureth the same length,—and whose beauty is surpassed by none among quadrupeds,—is known under the name of Sannādana, the grand-father of the monkeys;—this intelligent one battled with Sakra,72—nor did he meet with discomfiture. This is that general of the forces. And he whose prowess is like that of Sakra, is this one begot by Fire on a Gandharva's daughter, for assisting the celestials on the occasion of the war of the gods and the Asuras. And this graceful and powerful one—best of monkeys—disporteth in that sovereign of mountains inhabited by numbers of Kinnaras, where king Vaiçavana eateth rose apples, and which, O lord of Rakshas, ever conduceth to the pleasure of thy brother. And this one who never extolleth himself in battle, is named Krathana—leader of hosts. Surrounded by a thousand Koti (of troops), and stationed in the midst of the monkeys, he hopeth to subjugate Lankā with his own troops alone. And he that roameth about the Gangā, terrifying leaders of elephant-herds, remembering the former hostility of the monkeys and the elephants, is this leader of bands, who, roaring, opposeth wild elephants in mountain-caverns and crusheth trees,—and foremost of monkeys, and chief of the monkey-forces—like Sakra himself in heaven, sporteth, resorting to Uçiravija pertaining to Mandara, best of mountains, on the golden river.73 A thousand lacs of monkeys, elated with vigor and prowess, setting up roars and furnished with (long) arms follow him; and this one is the leader of those high souled monkeys. And, O king, he whom thou seest resembling clouds uplifted by the winds, is a leader named Pramāthi. And his fleet-coursing soldiery are fiery, and volumes of red-hued dust are scattered about him profusely on all sides. And these wondrous strong and dreadful Golāngulas74 numbering hundreds and hundred thousands, seeing the building of the bridge, surrounding, O mighty monarch, the leader named Gavāksha—a Golāngula—set up shouts, intending to demolish Lankā with their prowess. Where the trees bring forth fruits of every season and the black bees resort,—in the mountain furnished with solar splendour, which the Sun circumambulates, by whose radiance ever beam beasts and birds with a like hue,—whose table-lands are never forsaken by magnanimous Maharshis; where the trees yield every object of desire and all are fraught with fruits; in which best of mountains excellent honey is found,—there in the charming Golden hill, O king, sporteth this one—the foremost of the principal monkeys, Kaçari by name, a leader of bands. There are sixty thousand charming Golden hills. In their midst is that best of mountains,75 even as thou, O sinless one, art among the Rakshas. There in the inmost hill dwell (monkeys) tawny-hued; and white,—with coppery faces; yellowish like honey; sharp-toothed; having nails for their weapons; and four teeth like lions; irresistible like tigers all equal to Vaiçwānara, and resembling flaming venomous snakes; furnished with long tails; like unto mad elephants; seeming like gigantic hills; roaring like mighty clouds; with eyes tawny and round; of terrific mein; and emitting sounds,—and these are gazing at Lankā, as if devastating her. And this powerful one staying in their midst, is their leader, eager for victory; and the puissant (monkey) always looketh like the Sun himself; and this one, O king, is famed on earth by the name of Satavali. And this heroic one, powerful and mighty, established in his own prowess, hopeth to devastate Lankā with his own forces. And for compassing Rāma's desire, the monkey doth not cherish any kindness for his life. Gaya, Gavāksha, Nala, and the monkey Nila—each of these is encompassed by ten kotis of warriors. (Besides these) there are other choice monkeys dwelling in the Vindhya mountain, but I cannot enumerate these (monkeys) possessed of fleet vigor, in consequence of their vast number. All these, O mighty monarch, are of exceeding prowess,—all possess persons resembling mighty mountains; and all are competent in a moment to remove mountains and scatter the Earth with them\"."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Having heard the words of Sārana, who had described the forces (of the monkeys), Suka, addressed Rāvana, lord of Rākshasas, saying,—\"Those, O king, whom thou seest stationed, resembling mad elephants, like unto nyagrodhas76 belonging to the Gangā,—like unto Saias in the Himavān,—are incapable of being borne,—they are possessed of strength, and able to wear forms at will; resembling deities and Dānavas, and like the gods in conflict. These, numbering nine, five, and seven thousand kotis and thousand sankus and an hundred vrindas, are the ministers of Sugriva, residing in Kishkindhā—monkeys begot by gods and Gandharvas, capable of assuming shapes at will. And those two whom thou beholdest, staying there, of equal proportions and endowed with god-like shapes, are Mainda and Dwivida,—who have no equals in fight. Permitted by Brahmā, they had partaken of ambrosia. They hope to humble Lankā by their prowess. And he whom thou seest staying like a mad elephant, the monkey who, being enraged, can by his strength agitate the deep itself, who, searching for Vaidehi, had presented himself before thee, lord,—behold this monkey come again!—whom thou hadst seen before!77—is the eldest son of Kaçari, known as the offspring of the Wind-god—celebrated as Hanumān, who had bounded over the deep. Capable of wearing forms at pleasure, that first of monkeys is endeued with grace and strength,—and is of irresistible impetuosity even as that lord, the Wind. Seeing the Sun risen, (he) while a boy, resolving in his mind,—'Coursing a way measuring three thousand yojanas, I will bring the Sun,—my hunger is not appeased;' and he sprang up, elated with strength. And, not getting that god, incapable of being subdued by the deities, saints and Rākshasas, he dropped down on the Ascending-hill. And thereat a jaw of that strong-jawed one was a little fractured on the rock,—and he is called Hanumān in consequence. I know this monkey and all his previous history. I cannot describe his strength, beauty or prowess. And this one alone hopes to lay Lankā low by his energy. And why dost thou today forget the monkey, who had flung flaming fire into Lankā? And next to him is the hero of dark-blue hue, having eyes like lotuses, the Atiratha among the Ikshwākus—of prowess celebrated in the world—in whom virtue never wavereth and who never swerveth from righteousness; who knoweth the Brāhma Mantra and the Vedas,—the best of those versed in them—who pierceth the sky with his shafts and cleaveth the Earth, whose ire is like death, and whose prowess is like that of Sakra,—whose wife, Sitā, hath been carried away by thee from Janasthāna. And this is Rāma, who, O king, advanceth to encounter thee in conflict. And on his right side is one of the splendour of pure gold, broad-breasted, having dark curled hair—this one is named Lakshmana, ever mindful of his brother's welfare. He is versed in polity as well as warfare—the foremost of those learned in all the branches of knowledge; wrathful, invincible, victorious, powerful, conquering and strong,—the right arm of Rāma and his own life going about. For Rāghava he careth not for his life. He hopeth to exterminate all the Rākshasas in battle. He that stayeth occupying the left side of Rāma, and surrounded by Rākshasas, is the king, Bibhishana, sprinkled as the king of Lankā by the auspicious king of kings,—he, filled with wrath, approacheth thee (for battle). And he whom thou seest staying in the middle like a firm-based mountain, the lord of all monkeys, of immeasurable prowess,—and who in energy fame, intelligence, strength, and lineage, is as superior to the monkeys as the mountain Himavān overtoppeth all the mountains, who in company with the principal monkey-leaders dwelleth in inaccessible Kishkindhā hard to penetrate, and dense with trees, and difficult of access, and denying approach on account of rocks; and whose golden garland consisting of an hundred lotuses looks exceedingly elegant, which is the desire of men and gods, and where is established Lakshmi—(is Sugriva). And Rāma, having slain Vāli, hath conferred this garland, Tārā, and the eternal monkey-kingdom on Sugriva. An hundred of an hundred thousand is called a koti by the wise. An hundred of a thousand koti is called a Sanku. An hundred of a thousand Sanku is known as a Mahāçanku. An hundred of a thousand Mahāçanku is here termed a Vrinda. An hundred of a thousand Vrinda is known as a Mahāvrinda. A thousand Mahāvrinda is called here a Padma. An hundred of a thousand Padma is known as a Mahāpadma.

Observing this host, that hath presented itself, resembling a flaming planet, do thou, O mighty monarch, prepare thyself to the uttermost,—so that victory may be thine, and that thou mayst not come by discomfiture at the hands of the foe\"."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Seeing the leaders of monkeys as pointed out by Suka,—the exceedingly puissant Lakshmana—Rāma's right arm—and his78 brother Bibhishana staying near Rāma, and Sugriva of dreadful prowess—sovereign of all the monkeys,—and the strong Angada, grandson unto the thunder-handed one,79 and the powerful Hanumān; and the unconquerable Jāmbavān; and Sushena; and Nila; and Nala—best of monkeys,—and Gaya; and Gavāksha; and Sarabha; and Mainda; and Dwivida,—Rāvana, with his heart agitated a little, and his wrath aroused,—when their talk had ended, rebuked those heroes, Suka and Sārana. And he wrathfully spoke unto them, standing in humble guise with their heads hung down, harsh words faltering with passion,—\"That counsellors subsisting (on the wealth of their master and sovereign), should say aught disagreeable to him, whether they meet with his favor or disfavor—is not meet. Without being questioned, it is (proper) for you both to hymn the praises of a foe that is opposed and that hath advanced for encounter! Ye have in vain worshipped your preceptors, aged people, and spiritual guides, for ye have failed to appropriate the cream of Political Science, which should be availed of. Or if ye had appropriated the same, you have forgotten it afterwards; and ye bear the burden of ignorance. And it is owing to my good fortune that, having such stupid counsellors, I have as yet held my kingdom. Have ye no fear of death that ye use harsh speech towards me, who am the ruler and whose tongue dispenseth good and evil? Even trees may exist in the forest, coming in contact with burning fire; but transgressors cannot exist, visited with the chastisement of the monarch. I shall slay these wicked wights, who praise the side of the enemy, if my anger be not moderated, remembering their former good offices. Avaunt! Go hence from near me! I do not wish to slay you, remembering your good acts. Slain ye (already) are, who are ingrate and cherish no affection for me\". Thus accosted, Suka and Sārana, seeing (how things stood), covered with bashfulness, went out, saluting Rāvana by uttering 'Victory!' Then that ranger of night, the Ten-necked one, said unto Mahodara, who was present, to summon some spies. Thus accosted, Mahodara speedily ordered some spies (to present themselves). Thereat, the spies, hurriedly arriving there at the mandate of the monarch, and, presenting themselves, stood with joined hands, uttering blessings of victory. Then the lord of Rākshasas, Rāvana, addressed the spies, who were heroic, faithful, calm, and courageous,—\"Go hence, and acquaint yourselves with the exertions of Rāma; as well as with those who, being the custodians of Rāma's closest counsels, have gladly joined him (here). How he sleepeth and how he waketh, and what he engageth himself in,—having deftly acquainted yourselves with all this thoroughly, do you come (back here). The wise king that gathers (a knowledge of) his enemy through spies, can, putting forth a modicum of effort in conflict, neutralise (his exertions)\". Thereat the spies, saying,—\"So it is\", taking Sardula to the fore, with delighted hearts went round the sovereign of the Rākshasas. And, having gone round the high-souled Rākshasa-chief, the spies set out for where Rāma with Lakshmana was. And repairing secretly to the vicinity of the mountain bordering on the fair shore,80 they saw Rāma and Lakshmana with Sugriva and Bibhishana. And seeing that host, they were overwhelmed with fear. And, while staying there, they, discovered by the righteous lord of Rākshasas, Bibhisana, were sore harassed (by the monkeys). And that wicked Rākshasa, Sardula, alone was taken (before Rāma). But Rāma liberated him, who was assailed by the monkeys. And Rāma also, entertaining no enmity against them, also liberated the others, (who accompanied Sardula). And, on having been put to straits by the powerful monkeys of fleet vigor, they,81 breathing hard, and with their consciousness lost, again arrived at Lankā. Then those exceedingly strong spies, always ranging outside, presenting themselves before the Ten-necked one, informed him of the forces of Rāma, stationed near mount Suvela."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Then the spies communicated unto Lankā's lord news concerning Rāghava and his host stationed at the mount Suvela. Hearing the words of the spies, that Rāma, accompanied by a mighty army, had arrived (there), Rāvana was a little agitated and spoke unto Sardula,—\"Thy color hath changed its natural aspect, and, O ranger of the night, thou lookest poorly. Didst not come under the control of the wrathful foes?\" Thus ordered by him, then (Sārdula), bewildered by fear, addressed that tiger of a Rākshasa, saying,—\"Those powerful monkeys, O king, puissant, strong, and protected by Rāghava, are incapable of being ranged (by us). And they cannot be conversed with or interrogated. All around, the courses are kept by monkeys resembling hills. As soon as I entered, and was scanning that host, I was discovered. And forcibly taken by the Rakshas, I was pulled by them hither and thither. And furiously assailed by the monkeys with thighs, clenched fists, teeth, and palms, I was dragged in the midst of the army by the enraged monkeys. And, after having been taken all about, I was (at length) taken before Rāma, bleeding, with my limbs showing sorry work, and my senses swimming and paralysed. And, having been belabored by the monkeys, I, on craving his kindness with joined hands, was, at his pleasure, rescued by Rāghava, with, \"Don't, don't\"! Having filled up the deep with rocks and crags, Rāma equipped with weapons, stayeth, occupying the gate of Lankā. And, letting me off, that one of suspasstng vigor, surrounded by monkeys, and, arranging his forces in the Gāruda fashion, advanceth upon Lankā. And he draweth nigh to the wall. Therefore, do one of these things in preference to the other,—either render back Sitā, or give him battle\". Hearing this, Rāvana, lord of Rākshasas, then reflecting in his mind, spoke unto Sārdula these pregnant words,—'Even if the gods, Gandharvas, and Dānavas should array themselves against me, Sitā I shall not give, from fear of all creatures\". Having said this, that exceedingly energetic one again said,—\"Thou hast ranged this army. Who here among the monkeys are heroic? And, amiable one, what is their potency? And what are those monkeys that are hard to approach, like? And, O thou of fair vows, whose sons and grandsons are they? Truly relate all this (to me). Having ascertained their strength and weakness, I shall in this matter adopt my course. Those who wish for fight, certainly take account of all this\". Thus addressed by Rāvana, Sārdula—best of spies—thus begin to speak in the presence of Rāvana,—\"O king, that unconquerable one in fight, Jāmbavān, is well known as the son Gadgada, king of bears. The other son of Gadgada is the son of Sakra's preceptor. By which son, single-handed, was done immense oppression to the Rakshas. And the righteous and puissant Sushena is the son of Dharma.82 And the mild monkey, Dadhimukha, O king, is the son of Soma.83 And Sumukha, Durmukha and the monkey, Vegadarçin (resembling) Death himself, were for certain begot by the Self-create in the shape of a monkey.84 And Nila himself is the son of the bearer of sacrificial oblations;85 and Hanumān is famed as the son of the Wind-god. And the irrepressible and youthful Angada is the grandson of Sakra. And the lusty Mainda and Dwivida are sprung from Açwi. And five are the sons of Vaivaswata, resembling the Reaper himself—Gaya, Gavāksha, Gavaya, Sarabha and Gandhamādana. But I can not enumerate the rest, ten kotis of heroic monkeys—all sons of deities—burning for battle. And this is Daçaratha's son—this youth resembling a lion, who slew Dushana and Khara and Triçiras. There breathes none on Earth that is like unto Rāma in prowess, by whom was slain Virādha and Kavandha, resembling the Destroyer. No person can on earth describe the virtues of Rāma; by whom have been slain all those Rākshasas that had gone to Janasthāna. And here also is the virtuous Lakshmana, like unto the foremost of elephants, coming in the way of whose shafts, even Vāsava doth not live. And here are Sweta and Jyotirmukha, sprung from Vātskara's self; and the monkey Hemakuta is the son of Varuna. And the heroic Nala—best of monkeys, is the son of Viçwakarmā. And powerful and impetuous, Durdhara is the son of Vasu. And that foremost of Rākshasas, Bibhishana, thy brother, engaged in the welfare of Rāghava, hath laid seige to Lankā. Thus have I described unto thee the entire monkey host stationed in mount Suvela. As for what remaineth to be done, thou art the master\"."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Then the spies of the king informed him of the forces of Rāghava, incapable of being agitated, which had stationed themselves on mount Suvela. Hearing the arrival of Rāma's mighty army from the spies, Rāvana was a little agitated, and he spoke unto the ministers,—\"Let the ministers speedily present themselves, having their wits about them,—the time forsooth hath come for counsel\". Hearing his mandate, those Rākshasas, his counselors, swiftly presented themselves. And then he consulted with his Rākshasa counselors. Having deliberated duly, that resistless one, dismissing his ministers, entered his own abode. Then, taking with him the highly strong Vidyujjibha, huge-bodied and gifted with the powers of illusion, he entered where Mithila's daughter was. And the lord of Rākshasas said unto Vidyujjibha, skilled in illusion,—\"Do thou bring Janakas daughter under the sway of illusion. And, O ranger of the night, do thou, taking an illusory head of Rāghava, as well as a mighty bow with the shaft (set), present thyself before me\". Thus accosted, the night-ranger, Vidyujjibha, saying, \"So be it,\" displayed that desired illusion unto Rāvana. Thereat, the king, eager to meet with Sitā in the Acoka woods, well-pleased, conferred an excellent ornament on him. Then the exceedingly powerful lord of the Nairitas, the younger brother of the Dispenser of riches, entered (into that place) and saw (there Sitā) distressed, albeit unworthy of distress,—with her head hung down, overwhelmed with woe,—sitting on the ground, staying at the açoka woods, engaged in the contemplation of her lord, conciliated by dreadful Rākshasis remaining near. Then, drawing near Sitā, Rāvana, proclaiming his exultation, said these haughty words unto the daughter of Janaka,—\"O gentle one, he depending on whom thou, being soothed by (me), slightest me—that slayer of Khara, thy husband, Rāghava, hath fallen in battle. Thy roots have been competely severed, and thy pride hath been destroyed by me. In consequence of this calamity, O Sitā, thou shalt become my wife. O foolish (girl), renounce this idea. What wilt thou do with him that is dead? O meek (wench), be thou the mistress of all my wives. O thou of slender religious merit! O thou whose object hath been defeated! O thou that presumest to be wise! Hearken unto the destruction of thy lord, like the dreadful destruction of Vritra! Surrounded by a vast army gathered by the sovereign of the monkeys, Rāghava had presented himself on the shore of the sea, for compassing my destruction. And on the sun having set, Rāma stationed himself with his mighty army, oppressing the northern shore (of the sea). Then at midnight (my) spies coming to that host, thus stationed, fatigued from travel, and sleeping soundly (in consequence),—first ranged it. Then my mighty forces led by Prahasta slew his host overnight, where was present Rāma along with Lakshmana. And repeatedly upraising pattiças and bludgeons, swords, rods and other mighty weapons; and (discharging) showers of arrows, and darts, and daggers and maces and sticks and crows and bearded darts and discuses and clubs;—the Rākshasas discharged these among the monkeys. And while Rāma was sleeping, the furious Prahasta by means of a mighty falchion, with speed cut off his head clean. Bibhishana, who was flying at his will, was taken captive. And Lakshmana along with the monkey-army hath departed somewhere. And, O Sitā, Sugriva—lord of monkeys—hath his neck broken; and, O Sitā, with his jaw fractured, Hanumān hath been slaughtered by the Rākshasas.—And Jāmbavān, endeavouring to spring up with his thighs, was slain in the conflict; being severed by bearded darts, even as a tree cut off. And the stalwart Mainda and Dwivida—those foremost of monkeys—sighing and lamenting, bathed in blood,—destroyers of foes—were cut off with a sword. And Panaça is rolling on the earth like a (veritable) Panaça.86 And mangled by many iron arrows, Darimukha lieth in a cave. And the exceedingly energetic Kumuda, dumb, is slain by shafts. And torn by innumerable (arrows) discharged on all sides by Rākshasas, Angada, vomitting blood, lieth on the ground.87 And the monkeys, hard pressed by elephants, and others by networks of cars, lie low in the field, having been agitated like clouds by winds. And others afflicted with affright, flee, attacked (by the enemy) in the rear, and followed by the Rākshasas, like mighty elephants pursued by lions. And some have fallen into the sea, and some have taken refuge in the sky; and the bears have mounted up trees along with the monkeys. And on the shore of the sea, and in mountains and woods many are the tawny-hued monkeys that have been slain by Rākshasas of frightful forms. Thus hath thy lord been slain by my forces, along with his army; and I have his head, washed in blood and besmeared with dust\". Thereat, the exceedingly irrepressible lord of Rākshasas, Rāvana, spake unto a Rakshasi, in the hearing of Sitā,—\"Bring (hither) the Rākshasa, Vidyujjibha of cruel deeds, who hath personally brought Rāghava's head from the field\". Thereat, Vidyujjibha, taking the head along with the bow, bowing down the head (unto Rāvana), stood before him. Then spake king; Rāvana unto the Rākshasa, Vidyujjibha of the long tongue, who was staying by,—\"Do thou at once hold before Sitā the head of Daçaratha's son. Let her clearly behold the ultimate sad plight of her lord\". Thus addressed, that Raksha, throwing that graceful head before Sitā, swiftly vanished. And Rāvana cast down the mighty blazing bow, famed through the three worlds, saying,—\"This is Rāma's. This is the bow of thy Rāma with the string fixed. Slaying that man over night, Prahasta brought it hither\"."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Seeing that head and that excellent bow, and (remembering) the union of (Rāma) and Sugriva related by Hanumān,—and (seeing) those eyes, and the complexion of that face, and that countenance like unto that of her lord,—and that hair and that forehead; and that beautiful jewel forming the crest; and recognizing (Rāma) by all these tokens combined,— (Sitā), exceedingly aggrieved, rebuked Kaikeyi, lamenting like a female osprey,—\"O Kaikeyi, have thy wishes attained. Slain hath been the son of the race; and the entire race is exterminated by thee, partial to dissension. And what evil had been done unto Kaikeyi by the revered Rāma, that along with me, he hadst been banished into the woods, with rags given him (for his covering)?\" Having said this, Vaidehi, forlorn and trembling (all over), dropped to the earth, like a plantain cut off. Then, recovering after a while, and having regained her consciousness, the large-eyed one, placing the head in her front, gave way to grief. \"Ah! I am undone, O mighty-armed one! O thou that didst follow stern vows! From thy (death), I have come by this final plight, having been rendered a widow. The greatest calamity (that can befall a woman), is said to be the death of her husband. And, possessor of an excellent character, thou hast departed before me, who have ever trod the path of the righteous; but who have come by a mighty grief and am plunged in a sea of sorrow. And thou, who was engaged in delivering me, hast thyself fallen! And my mother-in-law, Kauçalyā, attached (to thee), through the death of thee, her son, at the hands of Rākshasas, hath been reduced to the condition of a cow that hath been deprived of her calf. O Rāghava, even the astrologers had predicted long life for thee. But their words are false,—thou, O Rāghava, wast short-lived. Or didst thy wisdom, wise and good as thou wert, come to naught? For God, who is the origin of all beings, maketh (every one) reap the fruit of his own acts. And why, versed in polity as thou wast, didst thou come by death, unforeseen? Thou wast acquainted with the means of warding off misfortune, and skilled in doing so. And having been brought hither by me, representing the Fatal Night, fierce and fell,—after (being) embraced, and by force,—the lotus-eyed one hath met with his death. Here liest thou, O long-armed one, leaving me lone,—and embracing the Earth like thy beloved fair. Ever carefully worshipped with perfumed wreaths, this bow of thine, O hero, embellished with gold, is dear unto me. O sinless one, thou hast surely gone to heaven, and (art there) in the company of thy sire and my father-in-law, Daçaratha, and all thy ancestors. Thou hast become a star of the firmament as the fruit of thy great act.88 Thou hast disregarded thy righteous race of Rājarshis. O king, why dost thou not look at me? And why is it that thou dost not answer me, who am a girl, hardly arrived at youth,—and who am thy wife and companion? That thou at the time of thy espousing my hand hadst vowed—I will practise (righteousness) with thee—do thou, O Kākutstha, recollect the same, and take me, who am overwhelmed with distress. Why, O best of goers, hast thou gone from this world to that other, leaving behind me, overwhelmed with distress? That person of thine which, decked out with auspicious things, I used to embrace, beasts of prey will for certain tear the same. Having performed the Agnishtoma and other sacrifices with Dakshinās (dispensed),—why hadst not thou attained purity by means of the sacrificial fire? Kauçalyā, overwhelmed with sorrow, shall only behold one of the three that had gone away to distant lands,—come (back)—Lakshmana. And, on being asked by her, he shall relate thine as well as the deaths of thy friend's troops over night at the hands of the Rākshasas. And, O Rāghava, hearing thee slain while asleep, and me staying in the abode of the Raksha, she with her heart cleft (in twain), shall cease to exist. And for the sake of me, abject that I am, that sinless son of the king, Rāma, possessed of prowess, having crossed the ocean, hath been slain in the footprint of a cow. I, the befouler of my line, who had been wedded by Daçaratha's son through want of discretion, becoming the wife of the revered Rāma, was (in reality) his Death. Without doubt, in another birth I had abstained from choice gifts,—and therefore it is that I sorrow to-day, albeit being the wife of one that was (ever dear) unto guests. Do thou, O Rāvana, speedily slay me upon Rāma; and, bringing the wife to the husband, compass my best benefit. Do thou join my head to his and my body to his body. I will, O Rāvana, follow the way of my high-souled lord\". Thus, burning in grief, did that large-eyed one indulge in lamentations; and Janaka's daughter kept fast gazing at the head and bow of her lord. And as the Rākshasa was by while Sitā was thus bewailing, there appeared before his lord, with joined hands, the warder, saying,—\"May the worshipful one be victorious!\" And saluting and propitiating him, (Rāvana), he told him that Prahasta, general of the forces, had arrived. \"Prahasta hath come to thee, surrounded by all the courtiers. And, O lord, I was despatched by him, desirous of seeing thee. O mighty monarch, surely there is—and thou art forgiving from thy regal sentiment89—some work which is momentous; and do thou see them\". Hearing these words of the Rākshasa, the Ten-necked one, leaving the açoka wood, went to see the counselors. And, having decided his entire course of action in consultation with his competent advisers, (Rāvana), entering his court,—well knowing Rāma's prowess, set about his work. And as soon as Rāvana left that place, that head and that bow vanished. And in company with the councilors of dreadful power, (Rāvana) decided his course with reference to Rāma. And then the lord of Rākshasas, Rāvana, resembling the day of doom, addressed his generals,—all well-wishers—staying hard by, saying,—\"Do ye speedily summon my forces with the beat of drums—nor do ye give out the reason (of the summons)\". Then assenting to his speech with \"So be it,\" the envoys immediately summoned that mighty force; and, when it had arrived, they informed their master, eager for conflict, of its arrival."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Seeing Sitā overwhelmed with grief, a Rākshasi, named Saramā, who was the beloved companion (of Sitā), drew near to her dear (friend), Vaidehi. And the mild-speeched Saramā comforted the exceedingly distressed Sitā, who had been bereft of her senses by the lord of Rākshasas. Sitā, who was protected there (by Saramā), had been made a friend by her. And, protecting her at the command of Rāvana, that kind-hearted companion, firm in vows, saw Sitā, deprived of her consciousness. And she90 comforted with a friend's affection that one of fair vows, who was rolling in the dust and rising up from it like a mare.91 \"Having come to the solitary wood for protecting thee, I, renouncing all fear of Rāvana, have, remaining hid, heard everything that he addressed unto thee, as well as what thou hadst replied unto him. For thee, O thou of expansive eyes, I have no fear of Rāvana. And, O Maithili, I, coming out, have also learnt well as to why the lord of Rākshasas hath gone out hence hurriedly. Rāma, acquainted with self, is incapable of being surprised in sleep; nor doth the slaying of that tiger-like one commend itself to me as probable. And the monkeys fighting with trees, well protected by Rāghava, like the gods protected by the foremost of the celestials, are incapable of being slain. And, possessed of arms long and rounded; graceful; broad-breasted; powerful; accoutred with the bow; and mailed; righteous; and famous over the earth; endowed with energy; and along with his brother, Lakshmana, ever protecting himself and others; of noble descent; and versed in polity; the destroyer of the hostile ranks; and of inconceivable strength and manhood,—the graceful Rāghava, O Sitā, slayer of foes, is not slain. This illusion hath been spread around thee by that fierce, illusion-creating one, whose mind ever runs upon improper acts and who opposeth himself to all creatures.—All thy sorrow hath departed, and thy good day hath dawned. Certainly Lakshmi seeketh thee. And, O lady, hearken unto what is dear to thee! Having crossed over the ocean, along with the monkey-host, Rāma hath encamped himself on the southern shore of the sea. By me hath been seen the complete Kākutstha along with Lakshmana, accompanied by the forces, stationed on the marge of the main,—protected (by his native might). Those Rākshasas of fleet vigor who had been despatched by this one, have brought the news that Rāghava hath crossed.—And, O large-eyed lady, having learnt this news, Rāvana—lord of Rākshasas—is consulting with all his counselors\". As the Rākshasi, Saramā, was relating this unto Sitā, she heard the leonine roars of the army, emitted with the greatest energy. And, hearing the mighty sounds of kettledrums produced by sticks struck (thereon), the honey-tongued Saramā spoke thus unto Sitā,—\"These dreadful sounds of the kettledrum, O mother, call to arms. And hark to the solemn notes of the kettledrums, resembling the rumbling of clouds! The mad elephants are caparisoned and the car-horses are yoked; and thousands (of warriors) are seen, mounted on steeds, with bearded darts in their hands. And, as waters fill up the ocean, mailed warriors of wonderful forms, vehement and roaring, by thousands rush out on all sides and fill the highways. And mark the splendour spread around by the polished arms and bucklers and mail,—and by the cars, horses and elephants of the followers of the Rākshasa-chief,—consisting of many hues shooting up,—like unto the appearance of a fire in summer, burning a forest,—and also mark the excitement of ihe high-spirited and fast-coursing Rakshas!92 And hear the sounds of bells and the rattling of the car-wheels! And hear the neighing of the steeds and the reports of the drums And fierce is the excitement of these Rākshasas—followers of the Raksha-chief,—with their hands hearing upraised arms,—capable of making people's hair stand on end. The sorrow removing Sree espouseth thee; and the fear of the Rakshas is come. And as Vāsava did unto the Daityas, the lotus-eyed Rāma, thy lord—of controlled anger, and of inconceivable prowess, slaying Rāvana in battle and thus delivering thee, shall approach thee. And, as Vasava put forth his prowess among his foes, in company with the foe-destroying Vishnu, thy lord, along with Lakshmana, shall display his prowess among the Rakshas. On the enemy having fallen, I shall behold thee, devoted to thy lord, with thy desire attained, soon lying on the lap of Rāma. And, O Janaki, embracing (thy lord), thou shalt shed tears of joy on his mighty breast. And, O Sitā, soon shall the highly powerful Rāma loosen this braid of thine reaching unto thy hips, which thou hast been wearing for many a month. And, O exalted one, seeing his face like the full moon risen, thou shalt shed water begot of ruth, even as a she-serpent casts off her slough. And, O Mithilā's daughter, speedily slaying Rāvana in battle, that one worthy of happiness shall reap felicity in the company of thee, his beloved. And, loved by the high-souled Rāma, thou shalt be happy, even as the Earth furnished with crops brought forth by plenteous showers. Do thou, O exalted one, take refuge with him, who, going round the foremost of mountains, speedily assumeth a steed-like circular movement; for even the maker of day is the source of people's joy and grief\"."

And then, desirous of doing her good, (Sitā's) friend, conversant with season, and ever preluding her speech with a smile, spoke unto her seasonably,—\"O thou having dark eyes, I can, secretly going to Rāma and communicating to him thy auspicious words, come back clandestinely. Nor, when I course the supportless sky, can even the Wind or Gāruda follow me\". As she said this, Sitā with her grief a little lightened, said unto Saramā in sweet and smooth words,—\"Thou art capable of even going to the nethermost regions. But do thou on my behalf that which is fit to be done by thee. If thou intend doing me a good turn, and if thy sense be steady, I would know what Rāvana is doing after having left this place. That guileful and wicked-minded one, Rāvana, destroyer of enemies, having powers of illusion, overwhelms me even as the Varuni just drunk. Confining me here for ever and a day, (Rāvana) sets on dreadful Rākshasas to alike threaten and scold me constantly. And I am agitated and alarmed, and my mind is (always) uneasy. And I, dwelling in the açoka wood, is ever agitated. If there is any talk (of delivering me), or keeping me confined,—thou shouldst communicate unto me the decision arrived at. This is the highest favor that I seek (at thy hands)\". Thereat, the mild-speeched Saramā, wiping (Sitā's) face washed in tears, spake unto her, as she said this,—\"If this is thy wish, I will go, O Janaki. O Mithilā's daughter, having possessed myself of the intent of the enemy, I shall come back\". Having said this, (Saramā), repairing to the Raksha, heard Rāvana's converse with his counselors. And having heard of the decision of that wicked-minded one, she, understanding decisions, swiftly retraced her steps to the fair açoka forest. And then, entering there, she saw Janaka's daughter, expecting (her) like a very Sri, bereft of her lotus. And, the fair-spoken Saramā, on getting back (near her), Sitā, embracing her affectionately, herself gave her a seat. \"Sitting down here at ease, do thou relate to me faithfully all about the determination of the wicked-minded and guileful Rāvana\". Thus accosted by the trembling Sitā, Saramā related everything that had been said by Rāvana and his counselors. \"O Vaidehi, the Raksha lord was advised by his mother and the aged counselors in pregnant words informed with affection, having thy deliverance for their object. 'Do thou make over Maithili unto the king of men, paying him homage due. Thou hast, in Janasthāna profusely witnessed wonderful instances (of his prowess). The crossing of the ocean, Hanumān's sight (of Sitā),—and the slaughter of the Rakshas in fight,—what person is capable of doing all this in battle?' Thus long exhorted by his counselors as well as his mother, Rāvana doth not make up his mind to emancipate thee, even as a covetuous person is loath to part with wealth (appropriated). And, O Maithili, without renouncing his life in battle, he doth not intend to liberate thee. Even this is the determination which that cruel one hath arrived at along with his advisers. This intent is in consequence of their coveting surcease. He can not yield thee up from sheer fear; nor is he backward in battle, or shirketh his own destruction or that of all the Rākshasas. O dark-eyed lady, slaying Rāvana in battle with sharp shafts, Rāma shall take thee back to Ayodhyā\". In the meanwhile there was heard a mighty uproar occasioned by the whole host, and drums and conchs,—which shook the earth. Hearing that hubbub of the monkey-army, the servants of the Rākshasa monarch, ran who were in Lankā,—growing dispirited and bereft of energy, with weakness overcoming their powers,—did not see any good, in consequence of the fault of the ruler."

 {
  "Yuddhakāndam": "And that captor of hostile capitals, the mighty-armed Rāma, was advancing (upon Lankā) with the sounds of drums mixed with the blares of conchs. Hearing this noise, Rāvana—lord of Rākshasas—reflecting for a while, cast his eyes upon his counselors. And addressing there all those counsellors, that afflictor of the world—the crooked and highly powerful lord of the Rākshasas, Rāvana, making his court resound,—running down (Rāma's) crossing the main, as well as his vigor, strength and manhood,—said to them,—\"What ye have said touching Rāma's (prowess), hath been heard by me. And I also know ye to be of sterling valor in the field. Yet why, knowing Rāma's prowess, do ye silently look at each other?\" Then the maternal grand sire (of Rāvana), possessed of exceeding wisdom, named Mālyavān, hearing his words, said,—\"The king that is accomplished in the various kinds of learning,94 and that followeth polity, ever commandeth affluence and bringeth his enemies under his subjection. He that seasonably concludes peace and carries on war with his enemies,—and who advances his own party, attaineth great affluence. A king should enter into peace, if he be an equal or inferior of his adversary, and engage in war, if be more powerful,—but an enemy should never be disregarded. Therefore, O Rāvana, peace with Rāma is what commends itself to me; and do thou render unto him that for which thou hast been invaded (by him), viz., Sitā. All the Devarshis and Gandharvas wish for (Rāma's) victory. Therefore, do not enter into hostilities with him; but do thou bend thy mind to ther conclusion of peace with him. That possessor of the six attributes, the Great-father, hath appointed two courses, (respectively) for the Asuras and the celestials, having for their proper objects righteousness and unrighteousness. Righteousness, we hear, is the course of the high-souled celestials, as, O Rākshasa, unrighteousness is that of Rakshas and Asuras. During the Krita Yuga, righteousness swalloweth up sin; and during Tishya,95 unrigheousness swalloweth up virtue. Thou, ranging the three worlds, hadst extinguished pregnant piety, and reaped unrighteousness; and it is for this that thy foes have waxed potent.96 And, having grown through thy neglect, unrighteousness devoureth us, and that protector of the gods, (righteousness), is strengthening the side of the celestials. Thou, addicted to carnal pleasures and acting in defiance of duty, hadst aroused the high wrath of the saints resembling fire. The power of these possessed of souls sanctified through asceticism, and ever engaged in invoking the aid of righteousness, is incapable of being resisted and is like flaming fire. The twice-born ones engage in contemplation with intent minds, and loudly recite the Vedas. They overpower the Rakshas, uttering the Vedas; and thereat they fly in all directions like clouds scattered in summer. And the smoke that ariseth from the Agnihotra sacrifices of saints resembling fire, enveloping the energy of the Rākshasas, spreads over the ten cardinal quarters. And ther fierce austerities of vow-observing saints, performed at particular sacred spots, try the Rākshasas sore. Thou hast obtained a boon, conferring immunity at the hands of deities, Dānavas and Yakshas. But men and monkeys, bears and Golāngulas, possessed of enormous strength and endowed with vigor, and of indomitable prowess,—coming here, are setting up roars. Witnessing various and many dire portents, I perceive the destruction of all the Rākshasas. Dreadful and terrific clouds, uttering harsh sounds, are showering blood all around Lankā. And (live) vehicles are dropping profuse tears. And all sides, covered with dust, do not appear bright as formerly. And beasts of prey, jackals and vultures, are emitting frightful cries, and, entering into the garden of Lankā, form themselves into bands. And in dreams mighty dark-hued women in front of dwellings, seizing at (the furniture ) thereof, and speaking inauspiciously, laugh displaying their sable teeth. And in houses dogs are feasting on the articles of worship. And cows bring forth asses, and mongooses, mice. And cats are pairing with leopards, and swine with dogs, and Kinnaras with Rākshasas and human beings. And red-footed white sky-coursing pigeons, urged on by Doom, are going about for the destruction of the Rākshasas. And female-parrots in houses, wounded and worsted by other birds delighting in discord, are dropping down, emitting indistinct notes. And all the birds and beasts are crying (distressfully) with their faces turned towards the sun. And at dusk a frightful, withered, tawny-hued male figure, looking like Death himself, with his head shaven, peereth into the houses (of people). These and other evil omens occur. Rāma I deem as Vishnu assuming the form of a man. Rāghava of steady prowess, for certain, is no human being,—he that hath built a bridge over the deep, must be an exceedingly wonderful person. Therefore, O Rāvana, conclude peace with Rāma—king of men. Having ascertained fit course, do thou act properly\". Having said this unto that vile one, and knowing the intention of the lord of Rakshas, that strong Mālyavān, of exceeding prowess, became silent, eying Rāvana."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "The Ten-necked one, come under the control of Time, did not brook the beneficial speech spoken by Mālyavān. Contracting his face into a frown, he, coming under the masterdom of passion, with his eyes rolling in wrath, addressed Mālyavān, saying,—\"The words which, deeming the strength of the enemy as superior, thou hast harshly spoken, considering it as beneficial, had never before entered my ears. A (mere) man, and feeble, and alone, and having monkeys for his support, why dost thou deem Rāma, who hath (further) been cast off by his sire, and hath in consequence taken refuge in the woods,—as competent (to cope with me)? And why dost thou consider me, who am the lord of the Rakshas, and feared even by the immortals,—as weak and reft of all power? Thou, I suspect, speakest (thus) roughly either from jealousy of my heroism, or for inciting me. And who that is wise and learned, ever addresseth him roughly that is at once puissant and of (high) station, if not to spur him on? Why, having brought Sitā like a Sri shorn of her lotus, shall I give her up, from fear of Rāghava? Behold Rāghava, environed by Kotis of monkeys, with Sugriva and Lakshmana, slain one of these days! He before whom even the gods cannot stay in the field,—how can that Rāvana ever come by fear? Better that I should be riven in twain,—but bend I never will. This is my native fault; and nature is incapable of being overcome. And if Rāma hath at his pleasure constructed a bridge over the ocean, what is the wonder in this that thou hast conceived such a fear? And although Rāma hath crossed the ocean along with the monkey-army, yet I swear unto thee truly, living, he shall not back hence\". When Rāvana, wrought up with passion, had spoken thus, Mālyavān, knowing him wroth, did not return a reply. And, duly tendering blessings unto the king, Mālyavān, taking his permission, went to his own abode. And the Rākshasa, Rāvana, along with his courtiers, having consulted together as to what was fit to be done, set about the defence of Lankā. And he commanded the Rākshasa Prahasta (to guard) the Eastern gate; and the exceedingly powerful Mahāpārçwa and Mahodara (to guard) the Southern gate; and he ordered his son Indrajit, possessing mighty powers of illusion, girt by innumerable Rākshasas, to guard the Western gate. And he commanded Suka and Sārana to defend the Northern gate. But he said unto the counsellors,—\"I will myself go thither\".97 And he posted in the middle in the garrison the Rākshasa, Virupāksha, endowed with exceeding prowess and energy, backed by countless Rākshasas. Having taken these measures in Lankā, the Rākshasa-chief, urged by Fate, deemed himself as having achieved success. Having thus completely provided for the defence of the city, he dismissed the ministers; and, honored by the counsellors with blessings of victory, (then) entered his magnificent and splendid inner apartment."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Those kings, man and monkey, that monkey the Wind-god's son, Jāmbavān—sovereign of bears—the Rākshasa, Bibhishana, the son of Vāli, Angada, Sumitrā's son, the monkey, Sarabha, Sushena along with his friends, Kumuda, Nala, and Panaça, arriving at the dominions of the enemy, assembled together, began to deliberate. \"Yonder is that Lankā ruled by Rāvana, invincible even unto the celestials, serpents and Gandharvas. Let us, keeping before us success in the enterprise, consult together for the purpose of arriving at a decision. We are here daily nearing Rāvana, lord of Rākshasas\". As they were speaking thus, Rāvana's younger brother, Bibhishana, said in a pregnant speech free from provincialism,—\"Anala, Panaça, Sampāti and Pramāti—all courtiers of mine—having gone up to Lankā, have come back here. Wearing the forms of birds, they entered into the hostile forces; and, having seen the measures that had been adopted (by them), have come (back). O Rāma, hearken to me as I tell thee truly anent the provisions which they have related, made by the wicked-minded Rāvana. In the Eastern gate stayeth Prahasta along with his forces; in the Southern, the exceedingly powerful Mahāpārçwa and Mahodara; and in the Western, Rāvana's son, Indrajit, supported by innumerable Rākshasas, equipped with pattiças, swords and bows, and bearing darts and maces in their hands,—surrounded by heroes carrying various weapons. And, backed by many thousands of Rākshasas weilding weapons, and accompanied by Rākshasas conversant with counsel, Rāvana himself, his heart agitated to the height, guardeth the Northern gate of the city. And Virupāksha with a powerful force accoutred in javelins, clubs and bows, protects the garrison in the centre. Having seen these hosts thus disposed in Lankā, my counsellors have speedily come back here. There are ten thousand elephants, an Ayuta cars, two of horses, and about a koti of Rākshasas, powerful and strong, and equipped with arms in conflict.98 These night-rangers are ever the favorites of the Rākshasa ruler. And, O king, a koti of forces accompany each of these Rākshasas in battle\". Having conveyed this information concerning Lankā, which had been communicated by his counsellors, the mighty-armed Bibhishana showed (unto Rāma) those Rākshasas themselves. And in company with his counsellors, Rāvana's graceful younger brother, ever striving for the welfare of Rāma, by way of answer communicated everything that was going forward in Lankā unto Rāma, having eyes resembling lotus-leaves,—\"O Rāma, when Rāvana battled with Kuvera, sixty lacs of Rākshasas marched forth (to meet him). In prowess, energy, vigor, exceeding fortitude, and hauteur, they resembled the wicked-minded Rāvana himself. In this matter, thou ought not to grow wroth,—I only arouse thy wrath, and do not endeavour to frighten thee.99 Thou canst subdue even the celestials by thy prowess. Therefore thou, environed by a mighty army, having arrayed the monkey-forces in order of battle, shalt thrash Rāvana (in battle)\". When Rāvana's younger brother had spoken thus, Rāghava, said these words with reference to his beating the foe,—\"Let that foremost of monkeys, Nilā, surrounded by an immense number of monkeys, cope with Prahasta at the Eastern gate of Lankā. And, engirt by a mighty force, let Angada, son of Vāli, resist Mahāparçwa and Mahodara at the Southern gate (thereof). And let that son of the Wind-god, Hanumān, backed by innumerable monkeys, (beating the host stationed) at the Western gate, find entrance (into the city). I myself, determined to compass the destruction of the lord of Rākshasas, who, waxing powerful in consequence of the boon he hath received, hath brought about the destruction of high-souled saints resembling gods and Dānavas,—and who goeth round all regions, oppressing people,—will, along with Sumitrā's son, smiting (the foe), occupy the Northern entrance, where Rāvana with his army is stationed. And let the powerful king of monkeys, and the puissant sovereign of bears, and the younger brother of the Rākshasa-chief, manage the soldiery posted in the centre. And in this battle, the monkeys need not assume the forms of human being. And let this serve for a sign that the monkeys, in order to the recognition of our own forces, appear with their proper monkey-marks. We seven only shall battle with the foe in human shapes,—viz., I along with my brother, the exceedingly energetic Lakshmana, and my friend Bibhishana counting for the fifth in company with his own following\". Having said this unto Bibhishana, for attaining success in the enterprise, that lord, the intelligent Rāma, seeing the sides of Suvela more beautiful (than other places), intended to ascend it. Then, environed by a mighty host, the high-souled and magnanimous Rāma, his features mirroring forth high exultation,—overshadowing the entire Earth (with his forces), set out for Lankā, determined upon destroying the enemy."

And (from here) will we view the abode of that Rākshasa who, foul of soul, hath carried off my spouse, to bring destruction down on himself,—who knoweth nor morality nor good conduct nor behaviour (conducive to the dignity of his descent),—and who, in consequence of his base propensity, hath committed himself to so heinous a course of action\". Having decided thus, Rāma, filled with wrath at Rāvana, coming to Suvela, ascended its variegated plateau. And Lakshmana, collected, went in his wake. And, upraising bow and arrow, Sugriva, (ever) engaged in valorous acts, accompanied with Bibhishana as well as his counselors, following him, also ascended (the mountain). And all those rangers of mountains, gifted with the vehemence of the Wind in hundreds ascended mount Suvela, where Rāghava was stationed. And ascending the mountain in a short time, they all beheld from its summit the city, appearing to be built on the air. And the monkey-leaders beheld Lankā, exceedingly splendid with noble gateways; gracefully enclosed with a wall; thronging with Rākshasas; and defended by sable Rākshasas. And the foremost of monkeys saw these appearing like another wall (overtopping the one beneath). And on seeing the Rākshasas, the monkeys burning for battle set up various roars in the presence of Rāma. Then the Sun, crimsoned with Eve, ascended the Setting-hill and Night came, illumined by the Moon at his full. Then the master of the monkey-army, Rāma, saluted and honored by Bibhishana, accompanied by Lakshmana as well as the leaders of the monkeys, sojourned happily on the breast of Suvela."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Having passed the night in Suvela, the heroic monkey-leaders surveyed woods and forests in Lankā. And seeing those extensive (woods and forests), mild, and charming, and beautiful to behold, they were seized with wonderment. Abounding in champakas, açokas, vakulas, çālas, and palms; covered with tamālas and panaças,—and environed all around with trees,—and surrounded with Hintālas, Aryunas, blossoming Saptaparnas, Tilakas, Karnikāras, and Pātalas,—trees with flowering tops, en tert wined with creepers,—Lankā looked exceedingly lovely, with various sights,—resembling the Amarāvati herself of Indra. And trees there, furnished with variegated flowers having tender rosy leaves,—and blue lawns, and rows of woods; and bearing odourous and charming blossoms and fruits,—looked like men adorned with ornaments. And there a delightful and pleasant wood resembling Chaitraratha, and like unto Nandana itself—having all the seasons present,—appeared beauteous to the view, with black bees all around. And it had Dātyuhas, and Koyasthivas, and peacocks dancing; and the strains of the coels were heard at the woodland rills. And the heroic and exhilarated monkeys, capable of wearing forms at pleasure, entered those woods and groves frequented by maddened birds and ranged by Bhramaras,—tracts overflowing with the lays of coels, and ringing with the voices of songsters,—resonant with the notes of Bhramaras—sovereigns of their species—and eloquent with the cries of ospreys. And as the exceedingly energetic monkeys entered, there blew upon them the breeze—like unto life—redolent of perfume obtained from contact with the blossoms. And others of the leaders among the heroic monkeys, coming out from the bands, ordered by Sugriva, made in the direction of Lankā crowned with ensigns. And, terrifying the fowls and dispiriting beasts and birds and shaking Lankā with their roars, those foremost monkeys set up shouts. And they, endowed with great impetuosity, went on, oppressing the earth with their battle-array; and clouds of dust suddenly arose from the the march of the soldiery. And bears, and lions, and buffaloes, and elephants, and deer, and birds, overwhelmed with affright, made for the ten cardinal points. The graceful and lovely summit of Trikuta was entire, elevated, sky-piercing, of golden splendour, measuring an hundred yojanas, clear-shining, level, inaccessible even to fowls, and incapable of being ascended even in thought—not to say of actual ascension by people. Lankā, ruled by Rāvana, was situated on its100 top,—ten yojanas in width and twenty in length. And that city was graced with lofty ornamented gateways resembling pale clouds, and golden and silvern walls; and Lankā was adorned with palaces and piles; like the sky101 graced with clouds on the approach of the rainy season. And that palace, which was adorned with thousands of pillars, and which, as if piercing the heavens, looked like a peak of Kailāça—was the residence of the Sovereign of the Rākshasas—the ornament of the city, (ever guarded by full hundreds of Rākshasas). And Lakshmana's auspicious and puissant elder brother, beholding that flourishing and wealthy city resembling the celestial regions,—charming to the mind, made of gold, graced with mountains, and decked out with mountains containing various metals,—resonant with the notes of various birds; abounding in various beasts,—furnished with various kinds of flowers,—and inhabited by various orders of Rākshasas,—was struck with astonishment. And Rāma, surrounded by his mighty forces, saw that palace, filled with diverse kinds of gems, adorned with rows of edifices, and having huge engines and gateways."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Then Rāma, accompanied by the monkey-leaders, along with Sugriva, ascended the top of Suvela, measuring a circumference of two yojanas. And staying there for a while and looking at the ten cardinal points, he saw Lankā finely placed on the charming summit of Trikuta,—graced with elegant groves; and (he also saw) the unconquerable lord of Rākshasas, stationed at the top of the gateway, fanned with white chāmaras; graced with the umbrella betokening victory; smeared with red sandal; adorned in red ornaments; resembling masses of sable clouds; and apparelled in golden attire,—his breast bearing scars from the tusk-ends of Airāvata; covered with a sheet hued like the blood of hares; and appearing like clouds lighted up by the evening sun. And on seeing the Rākshasa-chief, Sugriva suddenly rose up in the sight of the lords of monkeys as well as Rāghava. And influenced by wrath, he, mustering strength and vigor, rising from the brow of the mountain, bounded to the gateway. And pausing for a while and eying the Rākshasa intrepidly, he, slighting the Raksha, addressed him in harsh speech, saying,—\"O Rākshasa, I am the friend as well as the slave of Rāma—lord of men. Me, backed by the energy of that king of the Earth, shalt thou not escape to-day\". Saying this, he, suddenly springing up, descended on him; and snatching away his variegated crown, let it fall on the earth. And seeing him come abruptly, the night-ranger spoke to him thus,—\"Thou that wert Sugriva beyond my ken, shalt be neckless102 near me\". Having said this, he rose up swiftly and dragged him103 down to the earth. Thereat springing like pith, the monkey pushed down his antagonist with his arms. And each having his body bathed in sweat and his person covered with blood, each choking and annuling the efforts of the other,—and resembling a Sālmali or a Kinçuka, and dealing blows and slaps, and hitting with his arms and hands,—those exceedingly strong ones, the lord of the Rākshasas and that of the monkeys, fought wonderfully. And having for a long time encountered each other in combat on the dais belonging to the gate,—they, now lifting up their persons and now lowering them, went down, each felling the other with his legs. And smiting each other, they, their bodies fastened together, went down between the wall and the moat,—and again stood upon the ground. And heaving breath, they, resting for a space, grappled with each other; and they fast bound each other with their arms serving for ropes. And each fired with wrath, and each having both strength and skill, they now bore themselves in the lists like a tiger and a lion, furnished with teeth; or like the young of the foremost elephants engaged in encounter,—and restraining and pushing each other with their arms, they simultaneously both came down to the ground. Then starting again to their feet, they, vituperating each other, ranged the lists, displaying feats expressive of skill and strength. Nor did those heroes speedily come by fatigue. And resembling mighty elephants, they, resisting each other by means of their powerful arms like unto the trunks of elephants, fought for a long while, swiftly wheeling about the arena. And approaching each other, they strove to slay each other, like unto two cats seated, momentarily encountering each other over some food. And the lord of monkeys and Rāvana, accomplished in fight, coursed the arena, displaying wonderful mandalas,104 various sthānas105 curious gomātrakas106 gatapratyāgatas, tiraschi-nagatas, vakragatas, parimokshas, varjanas, paridhāvanas, abhidravanas,107 āplāvanas,108 savigrahāvasthānas,109 parāvrittas,110 apāvrittas,111 apadrutas112 avaplutas,113 apanyastas,114 and upanyastas.115 In the meanwhile the Raksha attempted to put forth his power of illusion. Knowing this, the king of monkeys shot into the sky. And Rāvana, overpowered by fatigue and out of breath, thus baffled by the monkey-king, stood where he was. Thus the master of the foremost monkeys, securing fame in fight, beat the night-ranger, causing him to experience fatigue. And bounding beyond the spacious sky, the offspring of the Sun came to the side of Rāma in the midst of the monkey-forces. And having done that deed, the son of the Sun,—lord of monkeys—with his heart surcharged with rejoicing, entered that host having the speed of the wind; enhancing the martial ardour of the son of the foremost of the Raghus, and honored by the monkeys."

But kings should not act in such a rash way. Placing in suspense, me, this army and Bibhishana, thou, O hero, enamoured of daring deeds, hast put thyself to all this trouble. But, O hero, henceforth, do not act so.

Ere thou hadst come, I had arrived at this determination; albeit, O thou that art equal to the mighty Indra or Varuna, I knew thy prowess full well. Slaying Rāvana in battle along with his sons, forces and vehicles, and installing Bibhishana in Lankā, and placing the kingdom in the hands of Bharata, I shall renounce my body, O exceedingly powerful one!\" When Rāma had said this, Sugriva answered,—\"Knowing my own strength, how, O Rāghava, viewing Rāvana, who had ravished away thy wife, could I forbear, O hero?\" As that hero was speaking thus, Rāghava addressed Lakshmana having auspiciousness, thus,—\"O Lakshmana, occupying some tract furnished with cool water and woods bearing fruits, we shall sojourn, dividing and marshalling our forces. I see a mighty fear present, destructive of people,—and boding destruction unto the foremost heroes among the bears, monkeys and Rākshasas. The winds ruffle; and the earth is tremulous. And the tops of mountains tremble, and the mountains themselves send up loud sounds. And the clouds are goblinish; and fierce; and harsh-sounding. And wearing terrific looks, they fiercely pour down showers mixed with drops of blood. And the Evening resembles the red sandal, and is fearful. And a flaming circle droppeth from the Sun. And exciting great fear, inauspicious birds and beasts, wearing cruel looks, and in distressful guise,—cry in piteous accents, facing the Sun. And at night, the ominous Moon with a black-red brim as at the time of universal wreck, burneth. And, O Lakshmana, there is a crimson, rough, slight, and graceful rim round the Sun; and a blue mark is visible on his disc. And the stars do not course as formerly. Behold, O Lakshmana, all these, prefiguring the Doom. And crows and hawks and vultures drop down. And jackals yell with loud inauspicious notes. The Earth, converted into mud with flesh and gore, shall be covered with darts and javelins and swords, discharged by Rākshasas and monkeys. This very day with all expedition shall we, surrounded on all sides by the monkeys, march towards the city governed by Rāvana\". Having said this unto Lakshmana, Lakshmana's elder brother possessed of exceeding strength, hastily descended from the top of the mountain. And descending from the mountain, the righteous Rāghava surveyed his troops, incapable of being beaten by enemies. And after making the mighty host of the monkey-king equip itself, Rāghava versed in season, along with Sugriva, at the proper hour, issued orders for battle. Then in due time that one, accoutred with his bow, surrounded by a mighty army, set out, with the intention of entering the city of Lankā. And those two—Bibhishana and Sugriva—and Hanumān, and Jāmbavān, and Nala, and the bear-king Nila, and Lakshmana, followed (Rāma). Behind them, the mighty array of bears and monkeys followed Rāghava, covering a wide surface of land. The monkeys, resembling elephants, capable of resisting foes, took mountain-peaks and tall trees by hundreds. And in a short time those repressors of foes—the brothers Rāma and Lakshmana—arrived at the city of Rāvana; with pennons streaming over her; charming; garnished with groves and woods; having variegated gateways; inaccessible; and having walls and gates. And urged on by Rāma's command, the wood-rangers,116 as commanded, blocking up (Lankā) incapable of being subdued even by the gods, stationed themselves. Coming to Lankā ruled by Rāvana, that hero, Rāma, son unto Daçaratha, along with Lakshmana, remained stationed at the Northern gate, where Rāvana used to reside. None save Rāma was competent to protect that dreadful gate, where Rāvana used to reside. None save Rāma was competent to protect that dreadful gate, guarded by Rāvana himself, like the Ocean guarded by Varuna,—and protected on all sides by terrible Rākshasas equipped with weapons; capable of striking terror into the weak; like unto the nether regions guarded by Dānavas. And (Rāma) saw there many and various arms and mail of the warriors, ranged together. And coming to the Eastern gate, that leader of the monkey-army, the powerful Nila, along with Mainda and Dwivida,—took up his post there. And the exceedingly strong Angada, accompanied by Rishava, Gavāksha, Gaya, and Gavaya, occupied the Southern gate. And the mighty monkey Hanumān protected the Western entrance. And Sugriva himself, with Prajangha, Tarasa and other heroes, was quartered near the garrision in the centre. And accompanied by all the foremost monkeys resembling Suparna or the Wind, twenty kotis of renowned monkey-leaders, blocking up all sides, stationed themselves near the monkey, Sugriva. And at Rāma's command, Lakshmana along with Bibhishana, went from door to door, issuing instructions to kotis of monkeys. On the west of Rāma, Jāmbavān along with Sushena, followed by innumerable troops, remained hard by at the garrison in the middle. And those tiger-like monkeys, furnished with teeth like unto tigers, weilding trees and mountain-tops, stood ready for fight. And all had their tails curled up, and all were armed with teeth and nails, and all had chequered bodies, and all had frightful faces. And some had the strength of ten elephants; and some had strength ten times as much; and some of the monkey-leaders there had the strength of a thousand elephants,—and some had the strength of numbers (of elephants); and some had strength hundred times as much. And others had immeasurable might. And wonderful and astonishing was their meeting. And the concourse at that place of the monkey-forces was like the concourse of locusts. And the air was filled up, and the earth was covered quite with the monkeys coursing towards Lankā and dropping down into it. And hundreds and thousands making up the army of monkeys, arrived at the gate of Lankā; while others were pouring in from all sides for encounter. And that mount was covered with monkeys. And a thousand ayutas were going round the city. And Lankā, blocked up everywhere with powerful monkeys bearing trees in their hands, was incapable of being entered even by the Wind. And the Rākshasas, sore pressed by thousands of monkeys resembling masses of clouds, and like unto Sakra himself in battle, were seized with amazement. And like unto the roar of water on the ocean being riven, there arose a mighty tumult in consequence of the forces surging hither and thither. And with that sound the entire Lankā, with her wall and gateways, her mountains, woods, and forests, began to shake. And that army, protected by Rāma and Lakshmana as well as Sugriva, became all the more invincible even by the Asuras and celestials. And having arranged his forces with the view of destroying the Rakshas, Rāghava, versed in the resources of war,117 taking counsel of the counsellors, and deciding again and again his course of action,—intending to adopt further measures,—resolved to abide by the advice of Bibhishana118, remembering the morality regulating monarchs119. And then, calling Vāli's son, Angada, (Rāma) said,—\"O mild one, going to the Ten-necked one, tell him in my words,—'Bounding over the deep and casting off fear and dejection, I have laid seige to the city of Lankā; and have reft thee of thy prosperity and thy wealth; and rendered thee moribund and senseless. Thou hast, O night-ranger, through delusion and pride injured saints and celestials, and Gandharvas and Apsaras, and Serpents, and Yakshas, and crowned heads. But, O Rākshasa, thy pride begot of the boon received from the Self-create hath gone from thee, whose destroyer,120 I, afflicted in consequence of my wife having been carried off,—weilding the rod, have sat down at the door of Lankā. O Rākshasa, thou shalt, remaining steady in fight, attain the state of celestials and Maharshis and Rājarshis. And, O worst of Rākshasas, do thou display that prowess of thine by which, aided by thy power of illusion, thou hast forcibly carried off Sitā, disregarding me. I shall with my sharpened shafts render this world free from Rākshasas, unless rendering back Mithilā's daughter, thou throw thyself on my mercy. And, for certain, that foremost of Rākshasas, the righteous and graceful Bibhishana, who hath joined us, shall obtain, without having a thorn in his side, all this wealth of Lankā. For thou, foolish, wicked, ignorant of self-knowledge, and having dolts for counsellors, art not competent to unrighteously exercise kingship for a moment. Fight thou, O Rākshasa, summoning fortitude and heroism. On being slain with my shafts, thou shalt attain peace.121 O night-ranger, if thou shouldst range the three worlds in the shape of a bird, thou, coming in my ken, shalt not be able to preserve thy life. It is all this for thy good; do thou perform acts for the good of thy body surviving death; and do thou see Lankā well; for thy life is in my keeping.'\" Thus addressed by Rāma of untiring deeds, Tarā's son went through the welkin like the embodied bearer of sacrificial offerings.122 And arriving near that subduer of enemies, Rāvana, in a moment, that graceful one saw Rāvana, sitting calmly in the midst of his ministers. And dropping down in his vicinity like a flaming fire, that best of monkeys, Angada, resembling a golden bracelet,123 stood there. And then introducing himself, Angada delivered unto Rāvana along with his ministers all that Rāma had excellently spoken unto him, neither extenuating nor setting down aught of himself,—\"I am the envoy of the king of Koçala—Rāma of untiring deeds; and I am the son of Vāli.—I do not know whether thou hast heard of me. And Raghu's son, Rāma—enhancer of Kauçalyā's joy—hath said unto thee,—'Do thou, O fell one, coming out, give me battle and prove thy prowess. Thee shall I slay together with thy ministers, and with thy sons and relations and friends. And thou being slain, the three worlds shall attain peace. And to-day shall I destroy the enemy of the gods and Dānavas, and Yakshas, of the Gandharvas, serpents and Rākshasas,—and the thorn (in the side of) the saints. And on thee being slain, all the wealth shall be Bibhishana's; unless, bowing down (unto me) and paying me homage, thou render back Maithili.'\" When that monkey-chief had spoken thus, the lord of the night-rangers was wrought up with wrath. And coming under the sway of passion, he commanded his counsellors, saying,—\"Take this one of perverse understanding, and slay him at once\"."

 {
  "Yuddhakāndam": "Hearing Rāvana's speech, four grim-visaged night-rangers seized (Angada) flaming in energy like fire itself. And Tārā's son suffered himself to be taken, in order that the hero might then display his prowess before the Yātudhānas.124 Then Angada, taking them up, who were pressed against his arms, like insects,—leapt up on a palace resembling a hill. Thereat, in consequence of the impetuosity of his bound, the Rākshasas, slipping off, fell on to the ground in the very sight of the Rākshasa king. Then the powerful son of Vāli with his legs attacked the top of that palace, elevated like a hill,125 of the lord of Rākshasas. And thereat, as formerly the summit of the Himavān had been cleft by the thunderbolt, the palace, thus assailed, was split in the very presence of the Ten-necked one. Having reft the top of the edifice, and proclaimed his name, Angada, setting up a mighty roar, sprang into the sky. And, aggrieving the Rākshasas and rejoicing all the monkeys, he came back to the side of Rāma in the midst of the monkeys. Rāvana was transported with wrath in consequence of the breaking down of the palace. And, finding his destruction (at hand), he began to heave sighs. And Rāma, surrounded by innumerable delighted monkeys setting up shouts,—anxious for slaying his foe, prepared for battle. And at the command of Sugriva, the exceedingly powerful monkey—Sushena—resembling a mountain-summit, surrounded by a large number of monkeys capable of assuming shapes at pleasure, began to range from door to door;126 like the Moon ranging the stars. Seeing the hundred akshauhinis of the wood-rangers, stationed in Lankā, extending down to the sea, some of the Rākshasas were struck with astonishment, while some came under the influence of fear; and some experienced delight from the (anticipated) delight of battle. And the space between the well and the moat all was flooded with monkeys. And the distressed Rākshasas saw the wall thronging with monkeys;127 and thereat exclaiming \"Alas\" \"Alas,\" the Rākshasas were extremely terrified. And on that frightful uproar arising, the warriors of the Rākshasa monarch,—Rākshasas—seizing mighty arms, began to patrol about, like unto winds blowing at the time of the universal dissolution."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Then those Rākshasas, going to that subduer of enemies, Rāvana, informed him that Rāma along with the monkeys had laid seige unto the city. Hearing the city beseiged, the night-ranger was enraged. And, hearing that double arrangements had been made (by Rāma) in guarding the gateways, (Rāvana) ascended the palace. He saw Lankā with her hills, woods, and forests, covered everywhere with innumerable monkeys eager for encounter. And he saw the entire Earth tawneyed with the monkeys; and he reflected within himself how he could destroy these. And reflecting for long, Rāvana having expansive eyes, assuming patience, gazed at Rāghava and the leader of monkeys. Rāghava with his host was fast approaching (the wall); and Rāvana saw Lankā defended on all sides by Rākshasas. And Daçaratha's son, seeing Lankā crowned with variegated ensigns and standards, mentally went to Sitā, with a sad heart. \"For my sake, here that one, Janaka's daughter, having eyes resembling those of a young deer,—is undergoing affliction; and lieth down on the ground\". And aggrieved at the thought of Vaidehi, the righteous Rāma speedily commanded the monkeys to compass the destruction of the enemies. As Rāma of untiring deeds said this, the monkeys, filling (the air) with leonine roars, began to press forward furiously. \"We shall cleave Lankā with mountain-peaks, or with our blows\"—thus thought the leaders within themselves. And the monkey-leaders stood, raising up gigantic mountain-peaks and tops of mountains, and rooting up various trees. And for doing what was dear unto Rāma, that army, divided into separate parties, in the presence of the Rākshasa-chief commenced scaling Lankā. And those copper-faced ones of golden sheen, who had consecrated their lives to the service of Rāma, equipped with trees and rocks, began to throng upon Lankā. And the monkeys with trees and hill-tops and blows crushed countless gates and tops of walls; and they filled the moat containing crystal water with dust, tops of crags, straw, and wood. Then leaders of thousands and kotis and hundreds of kotis began to scale Lankā. And the monkeys crushed golden gateways; and, breaking down gates resembling the tops of the summits of Kailāça, bounded roaring, some towards the wall and some all around. And resembling gigantic elephants, they rushed towards Lankā. \"Victory to the mighty Rāma, and Victory to the exceedingly powerful Lakshmana, and Victory to king Sugriva, who is protected by Rāghava\". Thus shouting, those monkeys, wearing forms at will, sending up roars, rushed amain towards the wall of Lankā. And Viravāhu, Suvāhu, Nala and Panaça—leader of monkeys—breaking (a portion of) the wall, took up their post there. In the meantime, (they) arranged the forces in order of battle. And the strong Kumuda, surrounded by ten kotis of victorious monkeys, stood obstructing the Eastern gate. And for backing him, there remained the monkey, Prasabha, as also the long-armed Panaça, surrounded by monkeys. And obstructing the Southern entrance stood the strong and gallant monkey, Satavali, surrounded by twenty kotis. And the strong sire of Tārā, the powerful Sushena, obstructed the Western gate, backed by kotis upon kotis (of monkeys). And obstructing the Northern gate, remained the puissant Rāma himself along with Sumitrā's son, as well as the king of monkeys—Sugriva. And that huge-bodied and dreadful Golāngula—the mighty and powerful Gavāksha—surrounded by a koti, remained by the side of Rāma. And that destroyer of foes—the exceedingly mighty Dhumra of the bears of terrific wrath, remained by the side of Rāma—where, surrounded by vigilant counsellors, and bearing a mace in his hand, stood the exceedingly strong Bibhishana, endowed with wonderful powers, in complete panoply. And Gaya, and Gavāksha, and Gavaya, and Sarabha, and Gandhamadana, protected the monkey-army, coursing all around. And then, his soul wrought up with wrath, Rāvana—lord of Rākshasas—speedily ordered the whole host to sally out. Hearing those words, which came out from Rāvana's mouth, all of a sudden the night-rangers sent up a dreadful yell. Then awoke the kettle-drums, having moon-like pale faces,—sounded by means of golden sticks. And conchs by hundreds and by thousands, capable of producing loud blares, filled with air proceeding from the mouths of dreadful Rākshasas,—were winded. And with conchs placed in their mouths, those night-rangers, having bodies blue like those of Cukas, resembled masses of clouds, with lightning and cranes. And, commanded by Rāvana, the troops cheerfully issued forth like the onrushing of the mighty main filling all at the time of the universal dissolution. And then the monkey-army gave a roar, spreading all around; and it seemed as if the sound filled all Malaya with its sides and caves. And sounds of conchs, and drums, as well as the leonine shouts of the impetuous (warriors); made the earth, air, and ocean, resound; and these mixed with the roars of elephants, the neighing of steeds, the rattle of the car-wheels, and the tread of the Rākshasas' feet. And in the meantime there commenced a mighty encounter between the Rākshasas and the monkeys, like that which took place of yore between the gods and the Asuras. And displaying their prowess, they128 began to slaughter monkeys with maces, and darts, and adzes. And the vehement monkeys (on their side) slaughtered Rākshasas with trees and tops of crags as well as with their nails and teeth. And a mighty sound arose of 'Victory unto king Sugriva!' and 'Victory unto thee, O king,'—each army taking the name of its king. And then other dreadful Rākshasas that were stationed upon the wall, dropping down, pierced the monkeys with darts and bhindipālas. And (thereat) the monkeys, flying into fury, descending to the earth and bounding, brought down the Rākshasas with their arms. And that encounter of the Rākshasas and the monkeys was mighty and wonderful, and the ground became wet with flesh and gore."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "And as the high-souled monkeys and Rākshasas fought on, their wrath vastly increased at sight of each other's forces. And furnished with steeds in golden trappings; and elephants resembling flames of fire; and cars appearing like (so many) suns; and shining armour,—the valiant Rākshasas issued, making the ten cardinal points resound. The Rākshasas of terrific exploits were burning for victory on behalf of Rāvana.—And the mighty monkey-army also, eager for victory, darted against the host of the Rakshas of dreadful deeds. And in the meanwhile, as either party assailed the other, there took place single combats between the Rākshasas and the monkeys. And as Andhaka had combated with the Three-eyed (deity)129 that Rākshasa, the exceedingly energetic Indrajit, fought with Angada, son unto Vāli. Sampati, hard to bear, engaged with Prajangha; and the monkey, Hanumān, entered into conflict with Jambumāli. And Rāvana's younger brother, Bibhishana, fired with wrath, encountered Satrughna, endowed with exceeding impetuosity. And the highly powerful Nila engaged with Nikumbha. And Sugriva—lord of monkeys—undertook Praghasa, and the graceful Lakshmana was engaged with Virupāksha. And the exceedingly irrepressible Agniketu and the Rākshasa—Raçmiketu—and Mitraghna and Yajnakopa, were engaged with Rāma. And Vajramubhthi encountered Mainda, and Açaniprabha, Dwivida. And those foremost of monkeys fought with those dreadful Rākshasas,—the heroic and terrible Pratapana, incapable of being overcome in battle, was combating with Nala of terrific force; and that lusty son of Righteousness, well-known as Sushena,—a mighty monkey—battled with Vidyunmāli. And other fearful monkeys encountered other Rākshasas; and many were the encounters that took place. And great and fierce was the engagement that took place between the heroic Rākshasas and monkeys burning for victory, capable of making people's hair stand on end. And from the persons of the Rākshasas and the monkeys there flowed a river of gore, having hair for grass (growing on its banks), and the bodies of the warriors for pieces of planks floating (adown the current). Indrajit, growing enraged, with his mace dealt a blow at that tearer of hostile ranks, Angada,—like him of an hundred sacrifices striking with his thunderbolt. Thereat, that graceful monkey, Angada, gifted with vehemence, with his mace crushed his car decked in gold, together with the steeds and the charioteer. Sampāti was pierced with three arrows by Prajangha; and the former (in his turn) slew Prajangha on the edge of battle with an Açwakarna.130 And Jambumāli, mounted on a car, possessed of prodigious strength, fired with wrath, with all the access of force derived from his car, wounded Hanumān between his paps. Thereat, getting at his car, Hanumān—son unto the Wind-god—with a slap speedily crushed his adversary's vehicle along with the Raksha. Then the terrific Pratapana, roaring, rushed at Nala; and thereat Nala, with his body pierced with sharp shafts by that swift-handed Raksha, plucked out Pratapana's eyes, and cast them to the earth. And that lord of monkeys, Sugriva, with a Saptaparna131 swiftly slew Praghasa, who appeared to be devouring up the troops. And, tormenting the Rākshasa of dreadful form with a shower of shafts, Lakshmana slew Virupāksha with a single arrow. And the irrepressible Agniketu, the Rākshasa Ragmiketu, Mitraghna and Yajnakopa, with their arrows rendered Rāma aflame. Thereat, Rāma, growing wroth, in battle severed the heads of those four by means of four shafts, dreadful, and resembling the tongues of a flame. And Vajramushti was slain in conflict by Mainda with a clenched fist; and down came he to the ground along with his car and horses, like a turret toppling (headlong). And Nikumbha in fight wounded Nila resembling a mass of blue collyrium, with sharpened shafts,—as the Sun pierceth clouds with his rays. Again with an hundred arrows, that light-handed night-ranger pierced Nila in the field; and Nikumbha laughed thereat. At this, even as Vishnu did in battle, Nila with a wheel of his132 car, cut off in conflict Nikumbha's head together with that of his charioteer. And Dwivida, possessed of the touch of the Vajra and thunder-bolt, in the presence of the entire Rākshasa host hurled a mountain-peak at him that was endowed with the splendour of the thunder-bolt. And Açaniprabha in encounter pierced that foremost of monkeys, Dwivida, with shafts resembling thunder-bolts. Thereat, beside himself with wrath, with his entire body wounded with arrows, Dwivida with a sāla destroyed Açaniprabha along with his car and horses. And Vidyunmali, mounted on a car, assailed Sushena with shafts decked with gold, and began to shout momentarily. Seeing him mounted on his car, Sushena—best of monkeys—taking up a huge crag, swiftly brought his car down to the ground. Thereat, endowed with lightness, that night-ranger, Vidyunmāli, at once extricating himself from his car, stood on the ground with a mace in his hand. Thereupon, that foremost of monkeys, Sushena, growing furious, taking up a gigantic crag, rushed at the night-ranger. And as he was descending, the night-ranger, Vidyunmāli, with his mace swiftly hit at the breast of Sushena—greatest of monkeys. Thereat, without thinking at all of the terrific hit of the mace, that best of monkeys in mighty conflict brought down that133 upon his134 head. And, assailed with the crag, the night-ranger, Vidyunmāli, having his chest crushed, fell down to the earth, deprived of life. And, like the celestials warring against the Daityas, the heroic monkeys warred on and confounded the valiant rangers of the night. And frightful was the field of battle, with darts, and other arms; and clubs, and javelins, and lances, and other weapons; and with broken cars, and war-horses, and mad horses slain, and monkeys and Rākshasas; and wheels and akshas,135 and yokes and standards,—broken and scattered over the ground; and swarms of jackals began to range on all sides of the monkeys and the Rākshasas; and Kavandhas136 began to rise in that terrific encounter, resembling the encounter of the gods and the Asuras. Thus destroyed by the foremost of monkeys, the rangers of night, beyond themselves with the smell of blood,—eagerly wishing for the setting of the Sun,137 again made active preparations for a renewal of the fight."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "As the monkeys and the Rākshasas thus fought on, the sun set, and the fatal Night came. And then commenced a night-engagement between the dreadful Rākshasas and the monkeys of fixed hostility, each party burning for victory. And in that profound darknesss, the monkeys and the Rākshasas began to slay each other, exclaiming,—'Thou art a Rākshasa,' and 'Thou art a monkey.' And in that army there was heard a mighty uproar of 'slain,' 'rive!' 'come!' 'why fliest?' And, dark-hued, the Rākshasas, equipped in golden mail, in that deep darkness appeared like elevated hills clad with woods of flaming medicinal herbs. And in that limitless gloom, the Rākshasas, transported with wrath, advanced with impetuous speed, devouring monkeys. And, fired with terrible wrath, they,138 bounding up, with their sharp teeth tore up steeds caparisoned in gold, and standards resembling venomous serpents. And the lusty monkeys in battle agitated the Rākshasa host,—and, waxing furious, with their teeth pulled and bit elephants and the riders thereof, and cars furnished with flags and standards. And Rāma and Lakshmana with shafts resembling venomous serpents, slaughtered the foremost among the Rākshasas—both those that were seen and those that were not.—And the dust of the earth arising from warring combatants, and from the hoofs of horses and the wheels of cars, choked up eye and ear. And as the mighty encounter, capable of making people's hair stand on end, went on, there flowed a fearful river of gore. And the sounds of kettle-drums and Mridangas and Panavas, mingled with those of conchs and car-wheels,—were wonderful (to hear). And the sounds of steeds neighing, and Rākshasas (roaring), and monkeys, rejoicing,—were something tremendous. And, with able monkeys slain; and darts and javelins and axes; and slaughtered Rākshasas wearing forms at pleasure, lying mountain-like,—the field of battle, seeming to have offerings of arms representing flowers,—became difficult to recognise, and inaccessible; and the earth was drenched with streams of blood. And that Night, destructive to monkeys and Rākshasas,—was dreadful, and difficult of being out-sped by all,—like unto the Fatal Night of beings. And in that profound darkness, the Rākshasas with great vivacity attacked Rāma with a shower of shafts. And the roars of those beings as they advanced, sending up shouts in anger, resembled the dashing of the Ocean at the time of the universal dissolution. And in the twinkling of an eye, Rāma by means of six shafts resembling tongues of flames, struck six of the night-rangers; viz., Yajnaçatru, irrepressible (in fight),—and Mahāpārcwa, and Mahodara, and the huge-bodied Vajradanashtra,—and those two—Suka and Sārana. And, pierced in their vitals with Rāma's shafts, they, having only their lives left to them, disappeared from the field. Then in the twinkling of an eye, that Mahāratha rendered all sides clear (of all gloom) by means of arrows resembling tongues of fire; and those other heroic Rākshasas that were in front of Rāma, were destroyed on approaching the place, like insects approaching a fire. And with shafts plated with gold lying in all directions, the night resembled one in autumn decked with fireflies. And in consequence of the uproar occasioned by the Rākshasas, and the sounds of drums, that night, already dreadful (in itself), became all the more so. And on that sound attaining dimensions on all sides, it seemed as if the mount Trikuta, containing numerous caverns, had been speaking. And huge-bodied Goāngulas of equal lustre with darkness itself,139 binding fast the night-rangers with their arms, began to swallow them up. And Angada was present in the encounter, for slaying foes, And Indrajit, fairing sadly at the hands of Angada, abandoning his vehicle, and having his horses as well as his charioteer slain, vanished then and there. And that feat of Vāli's son, worthy of being honored, all the celestials with the saints and both Rāma and Lakshmana lauded to the eight. All beings were acquainted with the might of Indrajit in battle; and, therefore, witnessing his discomfiture, and seeing that high-souled one, they rejoiced exceedingly, and, seeing the enemy vanquished, all the monkeys with Sugriva and Bibhishana, experiencing high delight, exclaimed,—\"Excellent!\" \"Excellent!\" And, beaten by Vāli's son of dreadful deeds, Indrajit was fired with a mighty wrath. And, being handled hard in battle, and having vanished from the field, the heroic and wicked son of Rāvana, who had received a boon from Brahmā, transported with passion,—remaining invisible, began to discharge sharpened shafts of the splendour of the thunder-bolt. And worked up into rage, he in the conflict pierced Raghu's sons, Rāma and Lakshmana all over their bodies, with terrific arrows consisting of serpents. And himself engirt with illusion, that night-ranger, given to fighting in crooked ways,—remaining invisible to all creatures,—stupified the descendants of Raghu in battle; and by means of his shafts bound the brothers, Rāma and Lakshmana. And then in the sight of the monkeys, those heroes and foremost of men were suddenly overpowered with shafts by the enraged (Indrajit). And when the son of the Rākshasa monarch felt himself incompetent to cope with them140 openly, then that impious one, resorting to illusion, bound those princes (by that means)."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Then, anxious to ascertain his141 course, the kings son possessed of prowess, and endowed with exceeding strength, Rāma, ordered ten of the monkey-leaders. And that repressor of foes ordered Vāli's son—Angada, the vigorous Sarabha, Dwivida, Hanumān, the mighty Sānuprastha, Rishabha and Rishabhaskandha. Thereat with alacrity those monkeys, weilding mighty trees, shot up into the sky, and began to scour the ten cardinal points. And Rāvana's son, skilled in arms, resisted the impetuous march of those vehement ones by means of a powerful weapon as well as arms more forceful (than the force of their rush). And the exceedingly vehement monkeys, cut and mangled with nārāchas, saw him in the dark like the sun enveloped in clouds. And that conquerer in battle, Rāvana's son, with shafts sorely pierced the persons of Rāma and Lakshmana. And both Rāma and Lakshmana had their bodies entirely covered by the angry Indrajit with shafts turned into serpents. And from their wounds blood began to gush out in streams; and they looked like flower-crowned Kinçukas. Then that one having red corners unto his eyes and resembling a mass of crushed collyrium, Rāvana's son, said unto the brothers, as he vanished,—\"When I fight remaining invisible, even Sakra—the lord of the celestials—cannot see or approach me,—and who are ye? And I, with my soul surcharged with wrath, shall, assailing them with showers of weapons furnished with Kanka feathers, send Raghu's sons to the abode of Yama\". Having spoken thus unto the brothers—Rāma and Lakshmana, cognizant of righteousness—(Indrajit)—pierced them with sharpened shafts, and shouted in joy. And stretching his large bow, that one sable like unto a mass of crushed collyrium again discharged terrific shafts in battle. And that one versed in the inner sense of things, with whetted arrows pierced the vitals of Rāma and Lakshmana and shouted momentarily. And fast bound by the shackles of shafts on the edge of battle, they142 could not attain respite for a moment. Then with their persons pierced with shafts and darts, and resembling the flags of the Great Indra let loose from the cords and trembling (in the air),—and with their bodies bristling with arrows,—those heroes and mighty bowmen—lords of the earth—tormented in consequence of their vitals having been pierced, dropped down to the earth. And those heroes, bathed in blood, and their persons covered with arrows,—pained and suffering terribly, lay down as became heroes. And there was not so much room unpierced in their persons as could be measured by a finger; and they were wounded with arrows up to the fore-parts of their hands.143 And they being wounded by that fell one capable of assuming shapes at will, blood violently gushed out of their bodies like water from a spring. And Rāma fell first, pierced in the vitals with the shafts. And the same Indrajit who had formerly wrathfully routed Sakra.(now) pierced (Rāma) with nārāchas knotted with gold, and having polished heads; swift-speeding; and resembling dust carried about by the wind; and half-nārāchas; and darts resembling anjalis;144 and vatsadantas;145 and sinhadanshtras;146 and razors; and, resigning his stringless bow decked in gold and curved in three places,—with its part for grasping shattered—he147 lay down like a hero. And seeing Rāma—foremost of men—down within arrow-range, Lakshmana despaired of his life. And seeing his brother, Rāma, having eyes resembling lotus-petals and ever delighting in battle, himself the refuge of others,—lying down in the field; (Lakshmana) began to weep. And the monkeys also, seeing him, were plunged in sorrow; and they, their eyes flooded with tears, began to cry in grief of heart. And when they had been bound and had laid themselves down as become heroes, the monkeys stood around them,—and, conversing with one another, they, headed by the son of the Wind, were seized with extreme sorrow."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "And the rangers of woods, gazing at the earth and the sky, at length cast their eyes on the brothers—Rāma and Lakshmana, covered all over with arrows. And after that Rākshasa had gone away having performed his work, like the God148 going away, after having showered,—there came to that place Bibhishana with Sugriva. And, mourning Raghu's sons, there also came in all haste Nila and Dwivida and Mainda and Sushena and Kumuda and Angada in company with Hanumān. And moveless; breathing low,—covered with blood,—pierced all over with net-works of shafts; dumb; they149 were lying on the field. And they were sighing like serpents; and were inert; and deprived of prowess; and washed in blood; and looking like unto golden standards. And as they lay moveless, as become heroes, the leaders of monkeys environed them with tear-charged eyes. And seeing the sons of Raghu lying, covered with showers of shafts, the monkeys, with Bibhishana, were pained (exceedingly). And the monkeys, surveying the sky as well as all directions, could not see Rāvana's son in battle enveloped with illusion. And then Bibhishana by means of illusion saw his brother's son staying before, hidden by illusion. And Bibhishana saw that hero of incomparable deeds, who had no compeer in the field and who had energy, fame and prowess,—as he remained invisible in consequence of the Boon received from Brahma. And Indrajit, seeing his own feat and them lying at length, spake in excess of joy, gladdening all the Rākshasas,—\"The brothers—Rāma and Lakshmana, possessed of great strength, who had slain Khara and Dushana, are themselves slain with my shafts. And all the celestials and Asuras assembled together with the saints, are incompetent to emancipate these from the fetters of my shafts. He for whom my father was exercised with anxiety and tormented by grief, for whom my sire used to spend nights without pressing his bed,—for whom this entire Lankā had resembled a river turbulent in the rainy reason,—that same evil sticking by the root of all, hath been dispensed his quietus by me. And like clouds of autumn, the prowess of Rāma and Lakshmana as well as that of all the rangers of the woods, hath been rendered useless\". Saying this in the presence of all the Rākshasas, Rāvana's son—destroyer of foes—menacing the monkey-leaders, hit Nila with nine arrows, and hurt Mainda and Dwivida each with three powerful shafts. And piercing Jambavān with an arrow in the chest, that mighty bowman discharged ten at Hanumān. And Rāvana's son possessed of exceeding impetuosity, pierced in the conflict with two shafts each Gavāksha and Sarabha of immeasurable vigor. And Rāvana's son, summoning celerity, pierced the king of Golangulas and Vāli's son, Angada, with innumerable arrows. And the powerful son of Rāvana, endowed with might, piercing the foremost monkeys with shafts resembling tongues of flames, set up shouts in the field of battle. And tormenting the monkeys with volleys of shafts and striking terror into them, that mighty-armed one, bursting out into a laugh, said,—\"Let the Rākshasas behold these brothers, lying fast bound with dreadful arrows, in front of the forces\". Thus addressed, those Rākshasas—wily warriors all—resembling masses of clouds, witnessing that deed (of Indrajit), struck with wonder and rejoicing (greatly), set up tremendous roars. And thinking that Rāma was slain, they honored Rāvana's son. And seeing the brothers—Rāma and Lakshmana—motionless, and lying inert on the ground,—they took them for slain. And, experiencing excess of joy, Indrajit—conquerer in conflict—entered the city of Lankā, rejoicing all the Nairitas. Seeing the bodies as well as the limbs of Rāma and Lakshmana, covered entirely with arrows, fear took possession of Sugriva. Thereat Bibhishana said unto that lord of monkeys, staying in woe begone guise, with a tearful countenance, and his eyes wild with wrath,—\"Do not give way to fear, O Sugriva. Restrain thy rising tears! This is the way of warfare: victory is not (always) sure. But, O hero, if Fortune ultimately smile upon us, this stupor shall go off from these high-souled and exceedingly powerful ones. Therefore, O monkey, do thou cheer me, who am forlorn\". Saying this, with his hand Bibhishana washed Sugriva's graceful eyes with water. And taking water, the righteous Bibhishana by means of his knowledge, washed Sugriva's eyes therewith. And washing the face of the intelligent monkey-monarch, Bibhishana spoke these words, seasonable and sedate,—\"O foremost of monkey-kings, this is no time for being overcome with stupor. At this hour, even immoderate affection may lead to destruction. Therefore, casting off stupor, which tends to mar all work, do thou bethink thee how thou mayst serve this army headed by Rāma. Or do thou protect Rāma so long as he doth not regain consciousness; and when the Kākutsthas shall have regained consciousness, all our apprehension shall vanish. This is nothing to Rāma, and Rāma is not dying. And Lakshmi,150 who is incapable of being attained by those that are doomed, shall not forsake this one. Therefore do thou comfort thyself, do thou also cheer up thy own forces,—while I am engaged in composing all the troops. O best of monkeys, these with distended eyes, come under the governance of terror, are, stricken with panic, whispering into each other's ears. But seeing me, let the forces rushing about, cheered up,—as well as the monkeys,—cast off all fear, like a wreath that hath been used before\". Thus comforting Sugriva, Bibhishana—lord of Rākshasas—again instilled spirits into the flying forces of monkeys. And Indrajit—worker of mighty illusions—accompanied by his troops, entered the city of Lankā and presented himself before his father. And approaching Rāvana and saluting him with joined hands, he informed his sire of the welcome tidings that Rāma and Lakshmana had been slain. And hearing that his foe had fallen, Rāvana springing up in the midst of the Rākshasas, with great joy embraced his son. And scenting the crown of his head, (Rāvana) with a delighted heart, asked (Indrajit as to all that had taken place). And on being asked, he (Indrajit) truly related unto his sire how (Rāma and Lakshmana) had been rendered senseless and lack-lustre by being fastened with shafts. Thereat, with rapture surcharging his inmost soul, Rāvana, hearing the speech of the mighty car-warrior, banished his fear of Daçaratha's son,—and rising up, honored his son with glad words."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "When Rāvana's son entered Lankā, after having accomplished his purpose, the foremost monkeys protected Rāghava, surrounding him on all sides. And Hanumān, and Angada, and Nila, and Sushena, and Kumuda, and Nala, and Gaya, and Gavāksha, and Panasa, and Samprastha—a mighty monkey—and Jāmbavān, and Rishava, and Sunda, and Rambha, and Satavali, and Prithu,—all forming themselves into array, and equipped with trees on all sides, and remaining vigilant,—the monkeys kept gazing at all sides, awry and upwards; and even when a straw stirred, they thought it to be a Rākshasa. And Rāvana, on his part, experiencing the height of exaltation, summoned the Rakshasis engaged in guarding Sitā.—And thereat the Rakshasis—Trijata and others—presented themselves at his command. And then the lord of Rākshasas, delighted, addressed then the Rakshasis, saying,—\"Tell Vaidehi that Rāma and Lakshmana have been slain in battle by Indrajit. And taking her on Pushaka, show her (Rāma and Lakshmana) lying slain on the field of battle. That one depending on whom she had proudly set her face against me,—that husband of hers, along with his brother, hath been slain in conflict. And then Mithila's daughter, her fear gone off with her anxiety, and herself losing all support,—Sitā—daughter unto Mithila—decked out in all ornaments, shall seek me. And today beholding Rāma with Lakshmana, come under the sway of Time, she, finding no other way, shall desist from her present course. And seeing no other resourse, that one of expansive eyes shall of herself seek me\". Hearing those words of the wicked-minded Rāvana, the Rakshasis, saying,—\"So be it,\"—went to where Pushpaka was. Then taking Pushpaka, the Rakshasis at Rāvana's command went to Maithili staying in the açoka wood. Then, taking Sitā, who was overcome with grief for her lord, the Rakshasis, placed her on the car, Pushpaka. And placing Sitā on Pushpaka along with Trijata, Rāvana took her all around (Lankā) crowded with ensigns and standards. And the lord of Rākshasas jubilantly proclaimed in Lankā,—\"Rāghava as well as Lakshmana have been slain by Indrajit in battle\". And going about with Trijata, Sitā saw all the monkey-troops slain. And she found the flesh-eaters elated in spirits, and the monkeys afflicted with extreme grief at the side of Rāma and Lakshmana. Then Sitā beheld both Lakshmana and Rāma lying in the field, senseless and bound with arrows. And those heroes were lying on the earth, their mail torn, their bows cast off, their bodies mangled all over and thickly pierced with shafts. And seeing those brothers,—foremost of heroes and best of men—having eyes resembling white lotuses, and themselves like unto Kumaras,—lying in the field,151—the fire-sprung one, Sitā, striken with grief, began to weep piteously. And that black-eyed one of an excellent person, Janaka's daughter—seeing them roll in the dust, broke out into lamentation. And with her eyes shedding plentiful tears, she seeing those brothers, endowed with god-like prowess, concluded them to be dead $ and overwhelmed with grief, spoke as follows."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "And seeing her husband, as well as the exceedingly powerful Lakshmana,—slain, Sitā, afflicted with grief, burst into bitter lamentation. \"The soothsayers had said that I should have sons, and should never be a widow. But on Rāma being slain, it seems now that those ones, possessed of knowledge, had spoken untruthfully. And those also, who having celebrated sacrifices and rites, had said that I should become the queen (of Rāma),—on Rāma being slain, seems to-day to have spoken a falsehood, although they are possessed of knowledge. And they also asserted that I should be honored of the wives of heroic kings as well as of my lord,—but on Rāma being slain, they seem to have uttered a falsehood, although possessed of knowledge. And those twice-born ones that in my hearing had said auspicious words, on Rāma being slain, seem to-day to have spoken a falsehood, although they were possessed of knowledge. These lotus-marks on the feet, betokening unto gentlewomen possessing them, that they are to be installed in the kingdom in company with their husbands—who are kings,—are on me. And those marks find I none on me by which women of rare fortune come by widowhood,—but I find that in me these good tokens are nullified. Those marks that are pronounced infallible by those versed in such knowledge, on Rāma being slain, are nullified in me. My hairs are fine, equal, and blue; my eye-brows touch each other; my hips are devoid of down and round; and my teeth are close. My temples, and eyes, hands, feet, ankles, and thighs are equal. And my fingers are furnished with round nails, and are plump and even in the middle. And my breasts are close and firm and developed, and have their nipples sunk. And my navel is depressed, with high sides. And my chest is swelling. And my complexion is like the hue of gems,—and my down soft. And they said that I was furnished with twelve auspicious signs. And my hands in the middle parts of my fingers contain wheat-marks; and in the spaces between the fingers, have no uneven corners. And my feet also partake of the general complexion. And my laugh is a gentle smile. And those versed in marks of women knew that I was possessed of such marks. And those Brāhmanas skilled in telling fortune said that I should be installed in the kingdom along with my husband; but all that hath been falsified. Having purified Janasthāna (of Rākshasas), obtained tidings of me, and crossed the Ocean152 incapable of being Agitated, those brothers have been slain in the footprint of a cow! The descendants of Raghu had obtained Vāruua and Agneya and Aindra and Vāyava and Brahmaçiras weapons.153 Through illusion have those lords of me, who am forlorn—Rāma and Lakshmana, resembling Vāsava himself in battle,—been slain. Coming in battle within ken of Rāghava, a foe, even if he be endowed with the fleetness of thought,—doth not go back, living. There is nothing which is too hard for Time; and the Destroyer is incapable of being overcome; inasmuch as Rāma along with his brother Lakshmana hath fallen in fight. And I do not so much mourn Rāma or the mighty car-warrior—Lakshmana—or, for that matter, self,—as I do the wretched Mother-in-law of mine. She ever thinketh of the period of the promise. 'When shall I behold Sitā and Lakshmana with Rāghava?'\" As she was thus lamenting, the Rakshasi, Trijata, said,—\"O exalted lady, do not weep thus. Thy lord liveth. And, O dignified one, I shall unfold unto thee potent and probable reasons why the brothers Rāma and Lakshmana live. When their leader falleth, the countenances of the warriors in battle are not overspread with passion, or display cheerfulness and vivacity. And, O Vaidehi, if those had lost their lives, this celestial chariot, named Pushpaka, would not have held thee. An army that hath its heroes and chiefs slain—becoming dispirited and drooping, rangeth the field, like a vessel on water that hath lost its helmsman. But, O lorn one, these troops, betraying neither agitation nor anxiety, are guarding the Kākutsthas. This I tell thee of them out of affection. Do thou, at this conclusion bringing in joy, take comfort; and behold the Kākutsthas unslain. This I tell thee from affection. I never told thee untruths heretofore; nor, O Mithilā's daughter, will I tell them unto thee now. Thou by virtue of thy character conducive to delight, hast found an access into my heart. These even the celestials and Asuras with Indra (at their head) are incompetent to quell. Seeing such sight, I speak to thee as to their being alive. And behold, O Maithili, this mighty wonder! These are lying insensible with arrows; but of those Grace hath not taken leave. It generally happens that the faces of persons dead and gone, are unsightly to a degree. Therefore, O Janaka's daughter, leave off grief and sorrow and stupor. For the sake of Rāma and Lakshmana thou canst not today put a period to thy existence\". Hearing her words, Mithila's daughter—Sitā—resembling the daughter of a celestial, with hands joined, said,—\"May this be so!\" Then turning away the car Pushpaka fleet as the mind, the distressed Sitā entered Lankā along with Trijata. Then in company with Trijata, alighting from Pushpaka, she along with the Rakshasis entered the açoka wood. And entering that sporting-ground of the Rākshasa lord abounding in woody tracts, Sitā, having beheld those princes and reflected on them, became subject to a mighty grief."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Bound up terribly with shafts, Daçaratha's sons, lying down bathed in blood, sighed hard like unto serpents. And all those foremost monkeys, along with Sugriva, possessed of exceeding strength,—overwhelmed with sorrow, remained surrounding those high-souled ones. In the meanwhile, the powerful Rāma, albeit fast bound by the shafts, awoke by virtue of the exceeding toughness of his person, as well as his might. Then, seeing his brother, having a distressful countenance, covered with blood, feeble, and fast bound by the shafts,—Rāma, greatly aggrieved, began to mourn. \"Of what use unto me is the recovery of Sitā, or life either, when to-day I see my brother vanquished in fight and lying down in the field? Seeking in the world (of men), I may light upon a woman like Sitā; but never on a brother, or a helper, or a warrior like unto Lakshmana. If that enhancer of Sumitrā's joy have met with his end, my life I must renounce in the sight of the monkeys. What shall I say unto Kauçalyā: and what shall I say unto Kaikeyi? And what shall I say unto mother Sumitrā, eager for a sight of her son? And if I go (back) without him, how shall I soothe her, like unto a cow reft of her calf; and trembling; and resembling a mourning Kurari? And how shall I say unto Satrughana and the illustrious Bharata,—'He went with me to the forest; but I come (back) here without him?' I shall not be able to bear the rebuke of mother Sumitrā. Therefore even here shall I renounce my person; for certainly I dare not live. Fie on me, who am wicked and base; for me this Lakshmana, brought down, lieth in the field of battle, like one that is without life. O Lakshmana, thou ever comfortest me when I am dispirited. But to day, having lost thy life, thou canst not speak to me, who am afflicted. Thou, O hero, who hadst in battle slain innumerable Rākshasas lying around, hast (at length) thyself been slain in the field with shafts. And lying down in the battle-field, bleeding, and covered with arrows, thou appearest like the Sun when he hath gone up the Setting-hill. And in consequence of shafts piercing thy vitals, thou canst not speak; but thy visible expression, albeit thou art dumb, betokens pain. O thou endowed with exceeding splendour, even as thou didst follow me into the forest, will I follow thee unto the mansion of Yama. Thou, having dear friends, and ever following me, hast come by this plight in consequence of my reprehensible conduct. I do not remember having heard any harsh speech from the heroic Lakshmana, even when he had happened to be exceedingly wroth. He that could discharge at one shot five hundred shafts,—that Lakshmana is superior to Kārttaviryya himself in that weapon—the bow. He that with his arms could resist the arms of Sakra himself,—that one worthy of a costly couch—lieth down on the ground, slain. And that false babble shall now, without doubt, consume me; for by me hath not Bibhishana been made monarch of the Rākshasas. Do thou, O Sugriva, this very moment retrace thy steps. Bereft of thy strength through me, thou wilt be worsted by Rāvana. And, O Sugriva, placing Angada to the fore, do thou, taking thy host as well as the equipage, in company with Nila and Nala, cross over the Ocean. By thee hath been achieved a mighty feat incapable of being done by another in battle. And pleased am I with the king of bears, and the lord of Golāngulas; and Angada hath quit himself nobly, as also Mainda and Dwivida. And Keçarin and Sampāti have both fought terribly. And Gavaya, and Gavāksha, and Sarabha, and Gaja,—and other monkeys have fought as others are incapable of fighting,—determined to lay down their lives (for me). But, O Sugriva, man cannot overrule Destiny. Thou, my friend, fearing righteousness,154 hast done what lay in thy power. And, Ye foremost of monkeys, ye also have acted as becometh friends. Now, with my permission, go ye whithersoever ye are minded\". Hearing Rāma's lament, the monkeys—those dark-eyed and others—began to shed tears from their eyes. Then Bibhishana, quieting the army, taking a mace in his hand, swiftly went to where Rāghava was. And seeing him fast making his way, resembling a mass of dark collyrium, the monkeys taking him to be Rāvana's son,155 began to run away."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Then out spake the highly energetic and exceedingly mighty king of monkeys,—\"Why is this host agitated like a bark driven hither and thither by the wind?\" Hearing Sugriva's speech, Vāli's son said,—\"Dost thou not see both those heroes—sons of Daçaratha:—Rāma and that mighty car-warrior—Lakshmana—covered with arrows? And (dost thou not see) those high-souled ones lying in the field of battle, covered with blood?\" Thereat, the lord of monkeys, Sugriva, spake unto his son,156 Angada—\"I do not deem it without cause. This may have come to pass through sheer fear. These monkeys with sad faces, leaving their arms behind them, are flying in all directions, their eyes distended in affright. And they are not ashamed of each other, and they do not cast their looks back. And they hug each other, and go leaping over the fallen\". In the meanwhile, that hero, Bibhishana, bearing a mace in his hand, (approaching), greeted Sugriva as well as Rāghava with blessings of victory. And Sugriva, seeing Bibhishana, capable of inspiring fear in the monkeys, spoke unto the high-souled sovereign of bears, who stood by,—\"This is Bibhishana that hath come hither, seeing whom the foremost among the monkeys, from fear of Rāvana's son who, they apprehend, he is,—are fleeing away, seized with a panic. Do thou at once stay these agitated with fear and scampering all around; and proclaim,—'This is Bibhishana, who hath come here.'\" Thus directed, Jāmbavān—king of bears—restraining those that were flying, composed the monkeys. Hearing the bear-king's words, and seeing Bibhishana, the monkeys, renouncing fear, desisted (from their flight). Then the righteous Bibhishana, viewing Rāma's as well as Lakshmana's body pierced with arrows, was exceedingly aggrieved. And washing their eyes with water, he, with his mind overpowered with grief, began to weep and broke out into lamentation,—\"The Rākshasas, fighting in wily ways, have brought to this pass these ones endowed with prowess and possessed of every perfection and gifted with might (of arm). And with his guileful mind, that brother's son of mine, wicked-souled and an evil son (unto me),—hath deceived these ones of straight prowess. Pierced with innumerable shafts, and covered with blood, these are lying on the ground like Salyakas157. Those depending on whose prowess, I had sought eminence, those foremost of men, sleep here soundly for renouncing their bodies. Living, today I am in distress: and my desire of dominion is annihilated; and my foe, Rāvana, hath his promise fulfilled and his aim crowned with success\". As Bibhishana was thus lamenting, the lord of monkeys—Sugriva—endowed with strength, embracing him, spoke unto him,—\"O thou cognisant of righteousness, thou wilt herein Lankā obtain empire: no doubt of this; and Rāvana along with his sons will be disappointed in their expectations. Both these—Rāma and Lakshmana—are under the aegis of Gāruda; and, casting off their stupor: they will in battle slay Rāvana along with his adherents\". Having thus soothed and comforted the Rākshasa, Sugriva addressed his father-in-law, who was at his side, saying,—\"Do thou along with numbers of heroic monkeys, taking those repressors of foes, the brothers—Rāma and Lakshmana—when they shall have regained their consciousness, repair to Kishkindhā. And I, slaying Rāvana along with his sons and friends, shall bring back Mithila's daughter, even as Sakra recovered the lost Srī\". Hearing the words of the monkey-king, Sushena said,—\"I had witnessed the war of yore between the gods and the Asuras. Then the Dānavas, enveloping themselves, momentarily destroyed the deities, albeit versed in arms and accomplished in weapons. And they, their senses lost, and their lives departed, Vrihashpati treated by means of his knowledge of mantras, as well with medicines. Let Sampati, Panaca, and other monkeys speedily hie to the Milky Ocean for the purpose of bringing those medicines. And the monkeys well know that mighty mountainous medicine—divine and capable of reviving the dead,—and made by the deities themselves—viçalyā. There are (the mountains) named Chandra and Drona: where the ambrosia was churned, there is that supreme drug. And those mountains have been placed by the deities in the mighty deep. And, O king, let the son of the Wind-god go thither\". In the meanwhile, the wind arose, and masses of clouds appeared along with lightning. And the wind blew, agitating the waters of the deep, and shaking the mountains. And mighty trees of the ocean-islands, broken down by the terrible wing-raised wind, began to topple headlong into the salt waters. And the serpents dwelling there were seized with affright; and speedily all the aquatic animals dived deep into the salt sea. And then in a moment the monkeys saw Vinatā's son, possessed of terrific strength,—like unto a flaming fire. And seeing him come, the serpents began to dart away,—those exceedingly powerful ones that, turning into shafts, had bound those persons.158 Then, touching the Kākutsthas and saluting them, Suparna rubbed with his hands their countenances furnished with the splendour of the Moon. And their wounds, on being touched by Vinatā's son, were (immediately) healed; and the bodies of both speedily became cool and shone with an excellent complexion. And they attained immense energy and prowess; and a double share of strength, and of rational and perceptive powers, and of memory. And then raising them up, the exceedingly energetic Gāruda, resembling Vāsava himself, embraced both joyfully. And then Rāma addressed (Gāruda), saying,—\"By thy grace we have through means survived the mighty calamity that had sprung from Rāvana's son; and we have also speedily been rendered strong. And my heart is delighted on having thee, like unto my father, Daçaratha, or my grand sire, Aja. Who art thou, furnished with beauty, and bearing wreaths and unguents (on thy person); clad in stainless attire; and adorned in noble ornaments?\" Unto him spake the exceedingly energetic son of Vinatā endowed with great strength,—the lord of birds, with a pleased heart, and his eyes wild with glee,—\"O Kākutstha, I am thy friend—thy life ranging externally—Garutman. I am come hither for aiding you. Neither the highly powerful Asuras, nor the exceedingly strong monkeys, nor the celestials along with the Gandharbas, having him of an hundred sacrifices at their head are,—capable of delivering (any one) from these dreadful arrowy bonds, which had been forged by Indrajit of tortuous deeds by help of illusion. These serpents—offspring of Kadru—are sharp-fanged and venomous; and had bound thee as arrows through the potency of illusion. O Rāma having truth for prowess, thou art fortunate,—along with that destroyer of foe in fight, Lakshmana. Hearing this, I, summoning energy, have come hither swiftly. And I, doing by thee as a friend, have from affection at once set you free from these dreadful arrowy bonds. But thou shouldst always be on thy guard. By nature the Rākshasas have cunning shifts in fight and thou, who art heroic and of a pure spirit, canst but rely on thy simplicity alone for strength. Therefore thou must not trust the Rākshasas in the field of battle. By this one instance (thou must know; that Rākshasas are ever deceitful in fight\". Having said this, the wondrous mighty Suparna, embracing Rāma) tenderly (again), said,—\"My friend Rāghava, O thou who even cherishest affection for thy foes, permit me thou. I shall go at pleasure. And, O Rāghava, entertain no curiosity as to our friendship.159 When, O hero, thou shalt have achieved success in battle, thou shalt know all about this friendship of ours. And with the surges of thy shafts, making Lankā contain only children and aged, and slaying thy foe, Rāvana, thou shalt recover Sitā\". Having spoken thus, Suparna, endowed with fleet vigor, having rendered Rāma hale in the midst of the monkeys,—having gone round them and embraced them also,—that one possessed of prowess,—set out, covering up the sky, like unto the wind. And seeing Raghu's sons rendered hale, the monkey-leaders set up leonine roars, and began to flourish their tails. And then beat the kettle-drums and the drums struck up. And conchs were cheerfully blown; and shouts were sent. And others struck at their arms with their hands. And the monkeys, accustomed to battle with trees, uprooting them, stood by hundreds and thousands. And emitting tremendous roars and thereby frightening the night-rangers, the monkeys, eager for encounter, approached the gate of Lankā. And that mighty and dreadful din raised by the monkeys, resembled the terrible rumbling of the clouds at midnight about the end of Summer."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Then Rāvana heard the tumult raised by the highly energetic monkeys roaring in company with the Rākshasas. And hearing that low and solemn noise—that prodigious uproar—Rāvana said in the midst of his counsellors,—\"From mighty roars that are heard of in innumerous delighted monkeys,—resembling the roar of clouds,—it is evident, beyond a doubt, that there is great rejoicing there. And the salt Ocean is vexed with these thundering noises. The brothers—Rāma and Lakshmana—have been fast bound with sharp shafts; and here this uproar is exciting my alarm\". Having spoken thus unto his ministers, the lord of the Rākshasas addressed the Nairitas present there, saying,—\"Do you speedily acquaint yourselves with the cause of rejoicing that hath arisen of these monkeys on this mournful occasion\". Thus accosted, they hurriedly mounting up on the wall, surveyed the forces maintained by the high-souled Sugriva as well as those exalted ones—Raghu's sons— emancipated from their terrific arrowy fetters and arisen (now)\". Thereat, with their hearts wrought up, grim-visaged Rākshasas descending from the wall, appeared before the Rākshasa-lord with pale faces. And then with woe-begone faces, those Rākshasas, skilled in speech, faithfully informed Rāvana in full of that unfortunate circumstance. \"Those brothers—Rāma and Lakshmana—who had in battle been bound up in arrowy fetters by Indrajit,—and whose arms lay moveless,—having been emancipated from the arrowy bonds, are seen in the field of battle; and those ones like unto the foremost of elephants in strength, seem like elephants that have snapped their fetters\". Hearing those words of theirs, the exeedingly powerful lord of the Rākshasas was wrought up with anxiety and anger, and his countenance lost its complexion. \"Indrajit, having routed them in conflict, had bound them by means of irrisistible and terrible arrows, resembling venomous serpents, and like unto the Sun himself,—which had been conferred on (Indrajit) as boons. But if my enemy, having actually been bound by the weapons, can have been liberated, all this strength of mine I see placed in peril. And those shafts resembling Fire in fierceness, which had in battle deprived my foes of their lives,—have forsooth been rendered fruitless\". Having said this in high rage, Rāvana, sighing like a serpent, addressed a Rākshasa, named Dhumrāksha, seated in the midst of the Rākshasas,—\"O thou of dreadful prowess, surrounded by a mighty force, do thou march forth to compass the destruction of Rāma along with the monkeys\". Thus accosted by the intelligent lord of the Rākshasas, Dhumrāksha, turning about, issued out of the abode of the king. And speedily sallying forth from the gate of (Rāvana's) residence, he said unto the general of the forces,—\"Do thou speedily move off thy forces. Why should a warrior linger?\" Hearing Dhumrāksha's words, the general of the forces, following them, at the command of Rāvana forthwith made the army ready. And those powerful and dreadful night-rangers, bursting with high spirits,—with bells tied to their arms,—set up shouts, and surrounded Dhumrāksha. And bearing various weapons in their hands, and wielding darts and clubs, and equipped with maces and bearded darts and rods and iron bludgeons and parighas and bhindipālas and lances and nooses and axes,—those terrific Rākshasas sallied out, roaring like unto clouds. And others, accoutred in armour, with cars; adorned with banners; furnished with golden networks, and mules having various faces, and extremely swift steeds, and lusty elephants in rut,—tiger-like Nairitas incapable of being subdued, even as tigers—sallied out (thereafter). And then Dhumrāksha himself ascended a superb car, bearing faces of deer and lions decked with gold,—and sending forth a loud clatter. And the highly powerful Dhumrāksha, surrounded by Rākshasas, cheerfully issued out of the Western Entrance, where Hanumān was posted. And thereat, fell fowls of the air forbade that exceedingly dreadful Rākshasa of a fearful form, as he went out ascending an excellent car, yoked with mules, and sending sharp sounds. And an exceedingly terrific vulture alighted at the crest of the car; and forming themselves into lines, vultures began to drop down about the top of the banner. And emitting a frightful cry, (a headless trunk) dropped down before Dhumrāksha. And that god160 showered down blood; and the earth shook. And the wind blew awry with a sound resembling thunder. And every side, covered with darkness, appeared dim. And witnessing those dreadful inauspicious omens at the outset, fraught with fear unto the Rākshasas, Dhumrāksha was greatly aggrieved; and the Rākshasas marching before him, were stupified. And then as that strong and fearful one, eager for encounter, surrounded, by innumerable night rangers, issued out (of the city), he beheld that monkey-host, protected by the arm of Rāghava,—resembling the deep at the time of the universal dissolution."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Seeing the Rākshasa—Dhumrāksha of dreadful prowess—issue out, the monkeys, rejoicing greatly, eager for encounter, set up roars. And then there took place a terrific conflict between the monkeys and the Rākshasas, charging each other with fearful trees, and darts, and maces. And the Rākshasas began to scatter the dreadful monkeys on all sides; and the monkeys (on their part) felled the Rākshasas with trees. And the Rākshasas, growing enraged, began to pierce the monkeys with straight speeding sharp shafts winged with Kanka plumes. And riven by the Rakshas with dreadful clubs and bearded darts, daggers and maces and terrible and curious bludgeons and grasped javelins,—the exceedingly powerful (monkeys), their anger aroused, began with alacrity to perform deeds of intrepid valour. And those monkey-leaders, their bodies pierced with shafts and their persons riven with darts, took up trees and crags. And those monkeys, endowed with terrific vehemence, sending up shouts, and proclaiming their respective names, set about tossing the brave Rākshasa ranks. And that conflict between the Rākshasas and the monkeys, waged with diverse rocks and innumerable trees, waxed exceedingly furious. And some among the Rākshasas feeding on gore—on being agitated by the monkeys burning for victory,—began to vomit blood. And some were severed along their flanks; and, some, slain with trees, were heaped up; and some were crushed with crags; and some were torn with teeth. And some being broken down by means of broken standards, and some by means of fallen swords, and some crushed down by cars,—the rangers of the night suffered sorely. And (anon) the earth was covered with huge elephants measuring mountains, and mountain-tops, and steeds crushed, and the riders thereof,—all borne down by the monkeys. And bounding again and again, the vehement monkeys endowed with terrific prowess, with their finger-nails tore up the Rākshasas by the mouths. And with woe-begone faces, and with hair dishevelled, (the Rākshasas), stupified with the smell of blood, saught the earth. And other Rākshasas endowed with dreadful vigor, waxing wondrous wroth, dealt the monkeys slaps with hands having the touch of the thunder-bolt. And, gifted with greater impetuosity, the monkeys felled the impetuous (Rākshasas) with blows, and feet and teeth; and some were slain with trees. And seeing the forces fleeing away, that foremost of Rākshasas—Dhumrāksha—flying into fury, began a terrific conflict with the monkeys desirous of encounter. And some of the monkeys, sore assailed with prāças, began to bleed; and some, wounded with maces, dropped down to the ground. And some were beaten hard with bludgeons; and some were cleft with bhindipālas. And some, on being assailed with bearded darts, became insensible and lost their lives. And some among the monkeys lay slain on the ground, drenched in blood. And some, fleeing away from the field, were slaughtered by the infuriated Rākshasas. And some, having their breasts pierced, lay on their sides. And some were riven with tridents; and the entrails of some had come out. And that mighty and dreadful encounter of the Rākshasas and the monkeys, was waged with countless weapons and rocks and trees. And that battle became a musical entertainment161 mellifluous with bow-string for Vinā,162 having the neighing of chargers for its measure, and with the cries of Maindas163 for its strains. Then in the field, Dhumrāksha bow in hand, laughing, pursued the monkeys in all directions with showers of shafts. And seeing the forces hard beset by Dhumrāksha and distressed thereat, the Wind-god's offspring, waxing enraged, seizing a huge crag, approached (the Rākshasa). And with his eyes doubly reddened in wrath, that one, like unto his sire himself in prowess, brought down the crag upon Dhumrāksha's car. And seeing the crag, (Dhumrāksha) upraising his mace hurriedly, leapt down in vehemence, and stood on the ground. And having shattered his car, that crag fell down to the earth. And thereat letting go the car furnished with wheels, Kuvaras and a face, as well as a banner; in which Dhumrāksha had left his bow,—Hanumān—son unto the Wind-god—laid about him right lustily for destroying the Rākshasas, with trees having branches long and short. And thereat some Rākshasas with their heads shattered, lay drenched in blood; and others, struck with trees, dropped down to the earth. And then Hanumān—son unto the Wind-god—charged in full career against the Rākshasa army; and, taking a mountain-peak, he rushed against Dhumrāksha. And as Hanumān was descending, the powerful Dhumrāksha, upraising a mace, and giving out a shout, made towards him speedily. And then Dhumrāksha enraged, brought down that mace studded with innumerable pricks, on the head of Hanumān fired with wrath. And thus assailed with the mace of fearful impetuosity! the monkey endowed with the strength of the wind, without at all heeding that blow, let fall a mountain-top right against Dhumrāksha's head. And on being assailed with the mountain-peak, Dhumrāksha, having his entire body mangled, suddenly fell to the earth, like unto a toppling hill. And seeing Dhumrāksha slain, those night-rangers that survived the carnage, in extreme agitation began to pour into Lankā, attacked by the monkeys. And that high-souled offspring of the Wind-god, having slain his foes, and come under the influence of fatigue incident to his slaughtering his enemies,—having caused rivers of gore to flow (in the field),—experienced the excess of joy on being honored of the monkeys."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Hearing Dhumrāksha slain, Rāvana—lord of the Rākshasas—overwhelmed with a mighty rage, began to sigh like a serpent. And collied with passion, and sighing hot for a long time, he addressed a cruel Rākshasa—the exceedingly strong Vajradanshtra,164—\"Go thou, O hero. Go out, environed by the Rākshasas. Slay Daçaratha's son—Rāma—and Sugriva along with the monkeys\". Thereupon hastily answering \"So be it,\" that foremost of the Rākshasas skilled in illusion, marched forth surrounded by many a leader165 of armies, furnished with elephants and steeds, mules and camels,—with his mind concentrated; and adorned with innumerable variegated flags and banners. And then decked out with curious keyuras and a tiara, and wearing armour, he rushed out with his bow in his hand. And then going round his flaming vehicle, adorned with pennons and garnished with gold, the king166 ascended the same. And equipped with slender swords and curious tomaras and smooth maces and bhindipālas and bows and darts and pattiças and scimitars and discuses and clubs and sharpened axes, the multiform infantry march bearing arms in their hands. And all those powerful and flaming Rākshasas wore variegated raiments. And heroic elephants in rut resembling mountains in motion, marched, being led by those well-skilled in battle carrying tomaras and hooks in their hands. And mighty steeds bearing auspicious marks, marched, ridden by heroes. And that entire Rākshasa army, as it marched forth, resembled clouds in summer roaring with lightning. And (the Rākshasas) sallied forth through the Southern Entrance, where that leader of herds—Angada—was stationed. And as they went out, evil omens appeared. From the cloudless yet fierce sky meteors began to shoot. And throwing up flames from their mouths, dreadful jackals began to emit cries. And frightened beasts betokened the destruction of the Rākshasas in battle, And warriors began to tumble down in an ominous way. Witnessing these evil omens, the exceedingly powerful and energetic Vajradanshtra, assuming patience, set out, eager for encounter. And seeing them flee away, the monkeys, yearning for victory, set up tremendous shouts, filling all the cardinal points. And then there came on a terrific encounter of the monkeys and the Rākshasas, dreadful, of terrific deeds, and wishing for each other's death. And warriors fraught with high spirits, springing up, dropped down to the earth, their bodies and hands riven, and all their persons bathed in blood. And some approaching each other, with bludgeons in their hands, without turning away from the field, discharged various weapons at each other. And there were heard sounds of trees and rocks and weapons,—mighty and dreadful and capable of striking terror into the heart. And dreadful and mighty were the sounds of car-wheels, and conchs and trumpets and drums. And some, casting off weapons, engaged in a hand to hand combat by means of slaps, and kicks, and bones, and trees. And some Rākshasas, having their bodies broken, were killed by means of thighs, and some were crushed with crags by Dānavas invincible in battle. And Vajradanshtra, resembling the noose-handed destroyer, frightening the monkeys, ranged in that field fatal to people. And Rākshasas, possessed of strength; equipped with various weapons, transported with passion, slew the monkey-forces. And then in the conflict the proud Wind-god's son, influenced by twofold wrath, spread havoc among the Rākshasa ranks, like the Fire at the universal dissolution. And the energetic Angada possessed of the prowess of a lion, with his eyes coppery with wrath, upraising a tree, began to spread terrible destruction among the Rākshasas, even as a lion destroyeth tiny deer. And attacked by Angada there, the Rākshasas of dreadful vigor, with their heads riven, fell down like unto trees that have been uprooted. And the earth became frightful (to behold), being covered with variegated cars and standards and steeds and the bodies of monkeys and of Rākshasas and streams of blood. And adorned with chains, and Keyuras, and attires, and umbrellas, the field of battle looked like an autumnal night. And agitated by Angada's impetuosity, that mighty army of Rākshasas began to shake, even as water trembleth, moved by the wind."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Finding his own army destroyed by the might of Angada, the exceedingly powerful Rākshasa—Vajradanshtra—was overcome with rage. And stretching his dreadful bow of the splendour of Sakra's thunder-bolt, he began to shower shafts among the monkey-ranks. And the foremost among the heroic Rākshasas also, stationed on cars, furnished with various arms, warred on in the encounter. And the heroic monkeys also—foremost of their kind—with rocks in their hands, fought around in united strength. And in that conflict, the Rākshasas began to incessantly shower ayutas among the flower of the monkey-army. And the monkeys,—pre-eminently valiant, and resembling mad elephants, kept showering over the Rākshasas mountain-trees and mighty rocks. And then took place a hot contest among heroic warring monkeys and Rākshasas, eager for encounter. And some, with their heads unbroken, had their arms and legs torn; and their bodies pierced with weapons, and laved with blood. And monkeys and Rākshasas lay down in the dirt,—thronged with numbers of Kankas, and vultures; and swarming with flocks of jackals. And striking affright to the timid, on the earth started up (spectral) headless trunks,—with their arms and heads torn, and their bodies torn all over. And monkeys and Rākshasas began to drop down to the earth. And the army of night-rangers, being brutally handled by the monkey-hosts, broke up at every point at the very sight of Vajradanshtra. And seeing the Rākshasas, distressed with fright and harassed by the monkeys, the powerful Vajradanshtra, with his eyes crimson-hued with choler, entered the arena, bow in hand,—frightening the monkey-forces. And he began to pierce the monkeys with straight-speeding shafts winged with Kanka feathers; And he pierced simultaneously seven, eight, nine, five, monkeys (in the field). And the exceedingly powerful Vajradanshtra, sported into a towering passion, began to cleave the docile ranks. And thereat terrified, the monkeys, with their bodies cut with arrows, rushed towards Angada, like vultures resorting to the Creator. And finding the monkey-ranks disordered, Vāli's son in a rage cast his eyes on Vajradanshtra, who also was eying him. And Vajradanshtra and Angada fought fiercely with each other over and over again; ranging the field like a tiger and a mad elephant167. Then (Vajradanshtra) with hundreds and thousands (of shafts) resembling tongues of flames, pierced the powerful son of the monkey in the vitals. Thereupon Vāli's son of mighty strength and tremendous prowess, with his body covered all over with blood, hurled a tree at Vajradanshtra. And seeing the tree in full career, the Rākshasa without betraying any agitation, severed it in pieces; and the tree, thus assailed, fell to the earth. And seeing that feat of Vajradanshtra, that foremost of monkeys, taking up a huge crag, hurled it (at his foe) and sent up shouts. And seeing this descend upon him, that powerful one, calmly leaping down from his vehicle, stood on his feet on the ground. And the crag discharged by Angada, coursing on in the field, dashed to pieces the car along with the wheels and the Kuvara as well as the horses. And then the monkey, taking up another prodigious peak crowned with trees, let it alight on Vajradanshtra's head. Thereat vomitting blood, Vajradanshtra, deprived of his senses, for a moment overcome with stupor, stood embracing his mace, sighing. And then the night-ranger, recovering his senses, with his mace, in high rage hit at the breast Vāli's son staying in the field. And thereupon, giving up his mace, he entered into a boxing encounter (with Angada). And hitting each other there, they both—the monkey and the Rākshasa,—began to vomit blood, and were overcome with fatigue consequent on the thrashing each sustained; and they endowed richly with prowess, appeared like Angāraka and Budha.168 Then the exceedingly energetic Angada—best of monkeys—uprooting a tree, stood there, covered with flowers and leaves. And (Vajradanshtra) took a shield composed of ass's hide,169 and a sword broad and sightly, covered with bells, and graced with a leathern sheath. And the monkey and the Rākshasa displayed curious and graceful movements. And attacking each other, they gave shouts, eager for victory. And with blood flowing from their wounds, they looked beautiful like blossoming Kinçukas. And warring, both, overcome with fatigue, went to the ground on their knees. Anon in the twinkling of an eye, that powerful monkey—Angada—started up, with his eyes glowing,—like unto a serpent that hath been smitten with a rod. And (at length) with his stainless and sharpened sword, Vāli's son, endeued with exceeding strength severed Vajradanshtra's huge head. And the graceful head of that one having his body covered with blood, cut off by the sword, falling to the ground with its eyes rolling, was severed in twain. Seeing Vajradanshtra slain, the Rākshasas, overwhelmed with fear and exceedingly agitated, in pitiful plight, with woe-begone faces and heads hung in shame,—fled towards Lankā, attacked (all the while) by the monkeys. Having compassed Vajradanshtra's destruction, the powerful son of Vāli, endowed with exceeding strength, in the midst of the monkey-army experienced great joy on being honored by the monkeys, like the wielder of the thunder-bolt—the thousand-eyed (Deity)—surrounded by the celestials."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Hearing Vajradanshtra slain by the son of Vāli, Rāvana said unto the general of his forces, standing before him with joined hands,—\"Let invincible Rākshasas of dreadful prowess, march forth, placing before them Akampana, skilled in all weapons and arms. He is capable of chastising foes as well as of protecting his own and leading them; and he is excellent in warfare. And he is always desirous of my prosperity, and always loveth warfare. He will conquer the Kākutsthas, as well as Sugriva endowed with exceeding strength, and, without doubt, slay all the other dreadful monkeys\". Taking Rāvana's command, that highly powerful one endowed with fleet vigor, marshalled those forces. Then equipped with various arms, the foremost of Rākshasas, having dreadful eyes (in their heads), and of dreadful forms, marched forth, urged on by their general. And, ascending a large car, adorned with burnished gold, Akampana, possessed of the splendour of clouds,170 and cloud-hued, and furnished with a voice resembling the roar of clouds, went out, environed by Rākshasas of terrific forms. And Akampana, resembling the sun in power, was incapable171 of being shaken in fight by the very gods, and of being beheld by them.172 And as, burning for battle, he rushed out in wrath, the steeds drawing his car suddenly lost their energy. And the left eye of that one delighting in encounter, began to throb. And his countenance grew pale, and his voice faltered. And in a fair day, it looked foul with the wind breathing roughly. And fierce and frightful beasts and birds began to emit cries. And that lion-shouldered one like a tiger in prowess, without heeding these ominous occurences, marched forth into the field. And as that Rākshasa was setting out along with the Rākshasas, he set up mighty roars as if agitating the deep. And the mighty army of monkeys was seized with trepidation at that sound. And then there took place a mighty encounter of the Rākshasas and the monkeys equipped staying in fight with trees and rocks; who had given up all concern for their selves in behalf of Rāma and Rāvana. And each side desirous of slaying the other, the monkeys and the Rākshasas were exceedingly strong and heroic and like unto mountains. And each party storming at the other, in that conflict were heard loud cries emitted by those swift-speeding ones in anger. And fearful was the dust red-hued that was raised incessantly by the monkeys and the Rakshas; and it enveloped the ten cardinal points. And in the field of battle, each enveloped with that dust raised, pale as silk, could not be discovered by the other. And in consequence of that dust arising, neither standard, nor ensign, nor shield, nor steed, nor weapon, nor car could be seen. And the fierce cries alone of those roaring and rushing were heard in that dreadful battle; but their forms were not visible to the sight. And in that conflict in the dark then monkeys enraged slew monkeys, and Rākshasas Rakshsasas. And monkeys and Rākshasas slaying (indiscriminately) friends and foes, made the earth wet with blood, and miry. And then with showers of blood the dust was layed; and the earth was covered with corpses. And Rākshasas and monkeys fast slew each other vigorously with trees and darts, maces and prācas, rocks, bludgeons and tomaras, and by means of their arms resembling bludgeons, coped with their adversaries appearing like hills. And in the encounter monkeys slew Rākshasas of dreadful deeds. And in their turn Rākshasas, wrought up with passion, bearing in their hands prāças and tomaras destroyed monkeys wielding dire arms. And that leader of the force—Akampana—growing wroth, inspired with cheerfulness all the Rākshasas endowed with dreadful vigor. And the monkeys forcibly snatching away the weapons (of the Rākshasas), began to rive the Rākshasas with mighty trees and giant crags. In the meanwhile those heroes among the monkeys—Kumuda, Nila and the exceedingly exasperated Mainda, summoned the utmost impetuosity they were masters of. And those foremost of monkeys and redoubtable able warriors without much ado began to spread quite a carnage in the van of the Rākshasa army, and by means of various arms terribly beat the Rākshasas."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "And witnessing that mighty exploit of the foremost of the monkeys, Akampana waxed furious with wrath. And transported with passion, he, twanging his mighty bow, seeing that feat of his foe, addressed his charioteer saying,—\"O charioteer, swiftly conduct thou the car to that same place. These powerful ones are slaying innumerable Rākshasas in fight. And all those vigorous monkeys of dreadful deeds stay before me, armed with trees and rocks. Those, pluming themselves overmuch on their martial worth, I intended to slay in battle. And all this Rākshasa force appeared to be harassed by these\". Then on a car drawn by moving steeds, Akampana from a distance attacked the monkeys with showers of arrows. And thereat the monkeys could not so much as maintain their ground in the field,—and how could they fight? And broken by the arrows of Akampana, they began to fly. And the exceedingly strong Hanumān, seeing his kindred come under the masterdom of Death and follow the course pursued by the shafts of Akampana, advanced (to the conflict). And seeing that mighty monkey, all those heroic prime monkeys together surrounded (Hanumān) in the field. And those best of monkeys, seeing Hanumān stay, grew strong by relying on that strong one. And even as the great Indra showereth down rain, Akampana showered shafts on Hanumān resembling a mountain-summit in grandeur. And without casting a thought on the showers of arrows poured on his person, that monkey gifted with exceeding strength, set his heart on compassing the death of Akampana. And laughing, that exceedingly energetic offspring of the Wind-god rushed after that Raksha, as if making the Earth herself tremble. And the form of that one roaring and flaming up in energy, was irresistible, like unto the appearance of a flaming fire. And thinking that he was unfurnished with any arms, that foremost of monkeys, waxing wroth, vehemently rooted up a hill. And taking that huge hill, the Wind-god's son endowed with prowess, sending up a tremendous roar, began to whirl it with a single arm. And as of yore Purandara had in encounter pursued Namuchi with the thunder-bolt, (Hanumān) pursued that best of Rākshasas—Akampana. And Akampana, seeing that uplifted crag, from a distance cut it off with mighty crescent-shaped shafts. And finding that mountain-top severed by the shafts of the Raksha and scattered in pieces, Hanumān was seized with a mighty wrath. And that monkey, wrought up with rage and pride, grasping an Açwakarna elevated like unto a hill, at once uprooted it. And taking that broad-shouldered Açwakarna, that one furnished with high splendour, with great glee whirled it above the ground. And thereat rushing amain vehemently, (Akampana) speedily broke the trees.173 And (seeing this), Hanumān, transported with passion, rived the earth with his kicks. And Hanumān slaughtered elephants, and the riders thereof, and cars with their riders, and dreadful Rākshasas, and footmen. And seeing the enraged Hanumān resembling the Finisher armed with trees and destructive, the Rākshasas began to fly fast. And seeing that one enraged, terrific unto the Rākshasas, the heroic Akampana was agitated greatly and sent up shouts. And Akampana pierced Hanumān endowed with exceeding prowess with four and ten shafts, sharpened and capable of cleaving the bodies of people. And thus covered with iron arrows and whetted darts, that hero—Hanumān—looked like a hill covered with trees. And that huge-bodied one endowed with wondrous prowess and great strength, appeared like a flowering Açoka or a fire without smoke. And then uprooting another tree, (Hanumān) summoning up his best impetuosity, swiftly hit Akampana—foremost of Rākshasas—on the head. And slain with that tree by that high-souled monkey-chief wrought up with passion, that Rākshasa fell down and died.174 And seeing that foremost of Rākshasas—Akampana—slain (and lying) on the ground,—the Rākshasas were extremely aggrieved, and (appeared) like trees in an earthquake. And those Rākshasas defeated, leaving their arms behind, made for Lankā in fear, pursued by the monkeys. And with their hair flowing loosely, (the Rākshasas), afflicted with affright, and despirited and beaten, fled fast, with the water of fatigue running down their persons. And crushing down each other, they entered the city in a panic, momentarily casting their looks behind them. When the Rākshasas had entered Lankā, the exceedingly mighty monkeys, assembled together, paid homage unto Hanumān. And Hanumān, gifted with strength, honored the seniors each as he deserved in consideration of his lineage. And the monkeys eager for victory shouted with might and main, and began to drag the Rākshasas with the view of taking their lives. And that mighty monkey—son unto the Wind god—having destroyed the Rākshasas and arrived (in the midst of the host), attained heroic glory,—even as did Vishnu, having slain that destroyer of enemies—the mighty and dreadful Asura possessed of exceeding strength,—stationed in the van of the forces. And then the deities and Rāma himself and the highly powerful Lakshmana, and also the monkeys headed by Sugriva, and Bibhishana endowed with great strength, honored that monkey."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Hearing that Akampana had been killed, the lord of Rākshasas, overwhelmed with anger, with his face somewhat fallen, cast his eyes on his counsellors. And then pondering and reflecting for a while, in the forenoon he went round the city of Lankā for inspecting the barracks. And the king surveyed the city guarded by the Rākshasas, covered with innumerable barracks, and crowned with ensigns and standards. And seeing the city beseiged, Rāvana—lord of the Rākshasas—seasonably spoke words of welfare unto Prahasta skilled in fight,—\"Save battle, deliverance find I none for the city suddenly beleaguered and put to straits. And this strain must be borne by these versed in warfare—me or Kumbhakarna or thee—my general—or Indrajit or Nikumbha.175 And therefore do thou from this place, speedily taking this force, march to where the monkeys are, for securing victory (in the encounter). And as soon as thou settest out, the monkey-forces, hearing the roars of the foremost Rākshasas—speedily setting themselves in motion,—shall flee away. And volatile and haughty and of fickle minds, the monkeys will not be able to bear thy shouts; even as elephants are incapable of bearing the roaring of a lion. And on that monkey-army running away, Rāma in company with Sumitrā's son, deprived of his power and shorn of support, shall, O Prahasta, come under thy subjection. In this matter, thy being slain is uncertain, but victory is certain. Now do thou, as thou weighest our welfare, declare thyself for or against this course\". Thus addressed by Rāvana, Prahasta—general of the forces—said unto the Rākshasa-chief; like Uçanas addressing the lord of Asuras,—\"O, king, before this we had deliberated together with wise counsellors, and then we disputed with each other in our respective views. And I had declared myself for giving up Sitā as fraught with our welfare; and we saw war involved in witholding her. I have ever been honored by thee variously with gifts and regard and soft speech. And what is thy good for which I shall not be at the pains? My life I do not care to keep,—nor yet my sons or my wife. Behold! for thee will I offer up my life into the sacrificial fire of conflict\". Having said this unto his master—Rāvana—the general, Prahasta, addressed his generals staying before him, saying,—\"At once bring up the mighty host of Rākshasas. To-day in the field of fight will I entertain the flesh-feeding fowls of the forest with the bodies of the foes slain with my resistless shafts\". Hearing his speech, the highly powerful leaders arrayed the army in that abode of the Rākshasa. And in a moment Lankā swarmed with heroic and terrific Rākshasas equipped with various arms,—as if with elephants,—as well as with people worshipping Fire and bowing down unto Brahmanas. And the perfumed breeze blew, laden with the incense of sacrificial offerings. And the Rākshasas, inspired with martial ardour, put on diverse garlands, consecrated with scriptural formulae; and donned on their armour. And furnished with their bows and wearing their armour, the Rākshasas, on seeing king Rāvana, leaving (their vehicles), stood, surrounding Prahasta. Then greeting the monarch, Prahasta, furnished (with all appliances of battle),—winding his dreadful trumpet, ascended his car; having all sorts of weapons; yoked with wondrous fleet steeds; driven by a competent charioteer,—excellently furnished; sending up sounds resembling the rumbling of mighty masses of cloud,—appearing like the very Sun or Moon; invincible with a serpent-standard; having a defence as well as a portion exceedingly handsome; netted with gold all round; and seeming to be laughing in grace. And then, ascending this car, Prahasta, whom Rāvana had entrusted with authority, surrounded by a vast host, swiftly went out of Lankā. And then there were heard the sounds of kettle-drums, resembling the roars of Parjanya,—and the sounds of musical instruments, as if filling the Earth. And on that general of the forces marching, sounds of conchs were heard (all around); and the Rākshasas of dreadful forms and huge bodies, going before Prahasta, advanced, emitting tremendous roars. And Narāntaka,176 Kambhahanu, Mahānāda,177 and Samunnata,178—Prahasta's counsellors all of them—went on, surrounding him. And he went out by the Eastern entrance, environed by this exceedingly dreadful array, resembling troops of elephants. And resembling the Destroyer—Yama himself—Prahasta in rage went out surrounded by that mighty host resembling the sea. And at the tumult raised by their exodus, as well as the roars of the Rākshasas, all creatures in Lankā began to cry in preternatural tones. And swarming under the cloudless welkin, birds feasting on flesh and gore began to gyrate at the right hand of the car. And dreadful jackals, emitting live flames from their mouths, set up cries. And stars began to shoot from the firmament; and the winds to ruffle. And enraged at each other, the planetary bodies were shorn of their brightness. And clouds emitting sharp sounds showered down blood upon the car, and those marching in front were washed therewith. And alighting at the top of the standard, a vulture set up cries, facing the south, and began to prick both its sides,—thereby depriving (Prahasta) of his grace. And from the hands of his charioteer and his driver conducting the steeds, never given to turning away from the field, the goad began to drop again and again. And the auspiciousness that was bright and rare when the army set out, was clean gone in a moment,—and the steeds began to stumble on even ground. And as Prahasta of renowned worth and valor marched, the monkey-army equipped with various arms, presented themselves before him. And loud was the tumult that was raised by the monkeys. And mighty was the din that was heard of those, uprooting trees and taking up ponderous crags of the Rākshasas roaring and the monkeys storming in both the exhilarated armies of Rakshas and wood-rangers,—of vehement and able (warriors) eager for slaying each other, and challenging each other to fight. And like an insect falling into a flame, the wicked-minded Prahasta, for obtaining victory, increasing his impetuosity entered into that host of the monkey-king."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Seeing Prahasta sally, ready for encounter, that chastiser of foes—Rāma—with a smile said unto Bibhishana,—\"Who is this huge-bodied one that armed with impetuosity, advanceth to the encounter? And what is his power and prowess like? O mighty-armed one, tell me this concerning this powerful night-ranger\". Hearing Rāghava's words, Bibhishana answered,—\"In Lankā this is the general of the lord of Rākshasas—the Rākshasa named Prahasta, surrounded by a third of the forces. He is possessed of prowess and is of distinguished gallantry. And that mighty army of strong monkeys, wrought up with wrath, and roaring at Prahasta, saw him dreadful and of terrific prowess and huge-bodied,—surrounded on all sides by the Rākshasas,—and setting up roars, marching. And the Rākshasas, eagerly desirous of victory, pursued the monkeys, wielding swords and darts and rishtis, and javelins and shafts and maces and clubs and bludgeons and prāças and various axes and curious bows. And the monkeys on their part, eager for encounter, took up flowering trees and hills and huge and broad crags. And each party approaching the other, great was the encounter that took place. And innumerable (monkeys and Rākshasas) kept showering rocks and arrows. And many Rākshasas in conflict slew many a powerful monkey, and the monkeys on their part slaughtered many a Rākshasa. And some were pierced with darts and with (other) powerful weapons; and some were wounded with bludgeons; and some were hewn with axes. And some rendered senseless, dropped down to the earth; and some hit with weapons, had their breasts riven. And some, severed in twain with swords, dropped to the earth lifeless. And monkeys were hewn in their sides by heroic Rākshasas. And numbers of Rākshasas all around were beaten to the ground by infuriated monkeys with trees and mountain-peaks. And some smitten sore with slaps having the touch of the thunder-bolt, began to vomit blood from their mouths, with faces and eyes turned pale. And great was the uproar that arose in consequence of Rākshasas and monkeys emitting distressful cries and sending forth leonine roars. And monkeys and Rākshasas wrought up with wrath, engaged in treading the path of heroes,—looking terrific with their faces moving about,—performed deeds of intrepid courage. And Narāntaka and Kambhahanu and Mahānāda and Samunnata—all counsellors of Prahasta—set about slaughtering the rangers of the woods. Of these doing swift execution among the monkeys, Dwivida, taking up a mountain-peak, slew one—namely Narāntaka. And then the monkey, Durmukha, rising up afresh, armed with a mighty tree, killed the light-handed Rākshasa—Samunnata. And Jāmbavān endowed with energy, waxing enraged, uplifting a giant crag brought the same down on Mahānāda's breast. And there speedily assailed by Tāra, with a mighty tree, the powerful Kumbhahanu gave up the ghost in the conflict. And not brooking that feat, Prahasta, mounted on a car, taking a bow in his hand, fell to spreading a dreadful havoc among the rangers of the woods. And then there the two hosts mingled into almost a vortex; and the sounds that arose from those infuriated ones of immeasurable might, resembled the roar of the ocean. And in terrific encounter the enraged Rākshasa irresistible in battle drove the monkeys to sore straits with showers of arrows. And the earth was covered quite with the terrible bodies of monkeys and Rākshasas; and it looked as if covered with mountains. And the earth drenched with streams of gore looked as if swarming with blossoming palāças in the month of spring. And as leaders of elephant-herds cross a lotus-tank covered with lotus-dust, those Rākshasas and choice monkeys crossed that river flowing in the field of conflict incapable of being crossed; having for her banks hosts of heroic warriors slain; for her mighty trees broken arms; for her volume of waters showers of blood; coursing to Yama resembling the Ocean; with livers and spleens for her vast slime; with scattered entrails for her moss; with riven bodies and heads for her fish; limbs for her lawns; swarming with vultures for her swans; with Kankas for her cranes; filled with fat representing her foam; with the roars (of warriors) for her sounds,—incapable of being crossed by cravens,—and resembling a real river swarming at the end of the rains with cranes and swans. Then all of a sudden Nila saw Prahasta stationed on his car, discharging vollies of shafts and harassing the monkeys therewith. And mounted on a sun-bright vehicle, that leader of the army—Prahasta—seeing Nila advance towards him amain in the encounter, like the wind in the sky scattering a mighty mass of clouds,—rushed towards Nila. And that leader of forces—Prahasta—foremost of bowmen, stretching his bow, began to shower arrows on Nila. And having pierced Nila sore and wounded him, those shafts sought the earth like enraged serpents. And that mighty monkey—Nila—endowed with energy, struck with those sharpened shafts resembling flames,—uprooting a tree, assailed therewith the irrepressible Prahasta—who was rushing against him. And thereat, that foremost of Rākshasas, on being attacked, flaming up into fury and uttering roars,—poured showers of arrows on the monkey-leader. And not being able to resist the arrowy vollies of that wicked-minded Rākshasa, (Nila) bore them, even as a bull beareth with closed eyes a fast-descending autumnal shower. And in the very same way did Nila with his eyes closed suddenly stand the mighty arrowy buffet of Prahasta incapable of being withstood. And wrought up with rage, the exceedingly strong and mighty Nila with a giant Sāla slew the steeds of Prahasta. And then his soul surcharged with wrath, Nila swiftly shattered the bow of that wicked-minded one, and then shouted again and again. On being bereft of his bow, Prahasta, general of forces, taking a terrible mace, leapt down from his car. And the redoubtable leaders endowed with activity, bearing hostility to each other, their persons bathed in blood, stood (on the ground) like two elephants (with their temples) riven. And they kept tearing each other with their teeth like a lion and a tiger, and also striving like a lion and a tiger. And endowed with victorious vigor, those heroes, never knowing to desist from fight, were eager for fame, even like Vritra and Vāsava (fighting). And then Prahasta putting forth his dearest effort, hit Nila on the temples with a mace; and the blood began to flow. And then the mighty monkey, with his person drenched in blood,—wrought up with passion, discharged a tall tree at Prahasta's breast. And without caring for that hit, he, taking up a mighty mace, furiously rushed against the monkey—Nila. And witnessing that enraged (hero) rushing against him with exceeding impetuosity, that redoubted monkey endowed with vehemence, took up a tremendous crag. And in the encounter Nila at once let that crag alight right on the head of Prahasta, eager for encounter and fighting with the mace. And hurled by that foremost of monkeys, that huge and terrific crag then shattered Prahasta's head in pieces. And then bereft of life and shorn of nerve and devoid of sense, he suddenly dropped down to the earth like a tree whose roots have been severed. And even as fountains flow from the sides of a hill, blood flowed profusely from the person of that one, whose head had been riven. On Prahasta being slain by Nila, that mighty army of Rākshasas, never trembling (from fear),—retreated towards Lankā. And like waters rushing (through a breach in) a dyke, the Rākshasas could not stand their ground, on their leader being slain. And on that head of the hosts being killed, the Rākshasas, growing dispirited, repairing to the residence of the lord of Rakshas, remained plunged in thought, without speaking anything. And plunged in that sea of sorrow, they seemed as if they had been bereft of their senses. And then the highly powerful and victorious Nila, leader of forces, on being extolled with gracious offices, and on being joined by Rāma and Lakshmana, looked exceedingly exhilarated."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "And on the leader of the Rākshasa host being slain in battle by the foremost of monkeys, that army of the Rākshasa monarch, resembling the ocean in violence,—furnished with dreadful weapons, began to scamper away. And going to the lord of the Rākshasas, they apprised him of the death of his general at the hands of the Fire-god's offspring. And hearing those words of theirs, the Rākshasa lord was overcome with rage. And hearing that Prahasta had been killed in battle, (he), exercised with passion, with his heart influenced with grief, addressed those foremost of the Rākshasa hosts, even as Indra addresses the chiefs among the celestials, saying,—\"That foe should no longer be disregarded that hath slain along with his followers and elephants that leader of my hosts that had destroyed the forces of Indra himself. Therefore, without taking thought, will I, for compassing the destruction of the foe, myself march to that marvellous field of fight. And to-day, even as a flaming fire burneth down a forest, will I with showers of shafts burn up that monkey-army, and Rāma and Lakshmana\". Saying this, that enemy of the sovereign of the immortals ascended a flaming vehicle of dazzling sheen yoked to rows of excellent steeds,—displaying itself gloriously and having a glowing body. And eulogized with sacred hymns, the sovereign of the Rākshasa rulers then set out to the sounds of conchs and trumpets and panavas; and in the midst of those produced by persons striking at their arms, with their hands, and of the sounds defiance, and leonine roars. And like that lord of the immortals—Rudra—surrounded by ghosts, the foremost of the Rākshsa monarchs was surrounded by bands of flesh-feeding (Rakshas) resembling cliffs and clouds,—with eyes glowing like fire. And at once issuing from the city, that one endowed with high energy saw that fierce array of monkeys, extended as the ocean or a mighty mass of clouds,—with arms upraised with rocks and stones. And seeing that terrific host of Rākshasas, that eminently auspicious one, followed by the forces, having arms resembling the lord of serpents—Rāma—spoke unto Bibhishana, foremost of those bearing arms,—\"Whose is this force furnished with various ensigns and standards—and equipped with prācas and swords and darts and other arms,—consisting of intrepid (Rākshasas), and having elephants resembling Mahendra179 itself\". Then hearing Rāma's speech, Bibhishana, possessed of the prowess of Sakra himself, informed Rāma anent that foremost of hosts consisting of that flower of high-souled Rākshasas, saying,—\"O king, him do thou know to be Akampana, who, possessed of a high soul, is on the back of that elephant,—whose face looks like the sun new risen, and who approacheth making the head of his elephant tremble (with the splendour of his person).180 And that one is named Indrajit—foremost by virtue of the boon (that he hath obtained), who ascending a car and having a lion for his ensign,—twangeth his bow like the very bow of Sakra displayed,—and who with his terrific round teeth appeareth like an elephant. And that one of a gigantic person is named Atikaya, that, like unto the Setting-hill of Vindhya, furnished with the bow and stationed on a car,—highly heroic, stretcheth his bow of unparalleled proportions. And that high-souled hero is named Mahodara that, furnished with right coppery eyes resembling the sun new risen, and ascending a car resonant with the sound of bells, shouteth shrill. And that one having the vehemence of the thunder-bolt is Piçācha, that, mounted on a steed in variegated golden trappings, and having the aspect of a mass of evening clouds, or a mountain,—(appeareth) with a prāça furnished with effulgence. And that one is the famed Triçiras,181 that, grasping a whetted dart endowed with the splendour of lightning and having the speed of the thunder for its minister, approacheth, riding a bull—the best of his species—and having the appearance of the Moon himself. And that one looking like a mass of clouds, that, having a broad and beautiful breast and a banner surmounted with the king of serpents, goeth in collected carriage, stretching his bow is Kumbha. And that one is Nikumbha of wondrous valorous deeds (in battle) that, grasping a flaming and smoky182 bludgeon embellished with gold and diamonds, cometh—a very banner of the entire Raksha host. And that one is Narāntaka, fighting with mountain-peaks,—that appeareth before us, mounted on a car flaming like fire, furnished with pennons and equipped with bows and swords and shafts. And that crusher of the hauteur of even the celestials,—that surrounded by various spectres of dreadful forms having faces of tigers, or camels, or powerful elephants, or deer, or horses,—and with their eyes rolling,—where the white umbrella resembling the Moon,—shineth, graced with slender ribs—the high-souled sovereign of Rakshas appeareth like Rudra himself environed by spectres,—the sovereign of the Rakshas decked with a diadem, with his countenance graced with pendulous ear-rings,—with a person resembling that monarch of mountains—even Vindhya himself,—that humbler of the pride of Indra the Great and Yama,—shineth like the Sun\". Then Rāma—repressor of foes—answered Bibhishana, saying,—\"Alas! Rāvana—lord of the Rākshasas—is of exceeding glowing splendour; and Rāvana shineth in glory, and is incapable of being gazed at like the Sun himself. And his grace, being enshrouded in his own splendour, I cannot view plainly. And the persons of celestials appear splendid as doth the person of the Rākshasa-chief. And all the warriors of that high-souled one are like mountains and fight with crags; and all are equipped with flaming weapons. And environed by glowing ghosts of dreadful forms and fierce-looking and furnished with material tenements,183—the king of Rākshasas appeareth imposing like the Destroyer himself. And by luck it is that to-day the wicked-minded one hath come within the range of my vision; and to-day will I vent my wrath incident to the ravishment of Sitā\". Having said this, Rāma endowed with prowess, ever followed by Lakshmana, stood, taking up his bow and pulling out a powerful shaft. And then that high-souled lord of Rākshasas addressed that mighty host, saying,—\"Do ye casting off fear stay at ease, at the gateways, high ways, and the edifices (in Lankā). Taking note of this lapse,—viz., that ye have all come hither with me, the wood-rangers in a body, subduing the empty city incapable of being withstood,—shall suddenly put (all) to straits\". Then leaving those counsellors, (Rāvana) on the Rakshas having departed agreeably to his injunction, dived into that ocean of monkeys, like a mighty fish diving into the waves of over brimming deep. And seeing the lord of Rākshasas, furnished with flaming a bow and arrows,—suddenly rushing,—the king of monkeys, uprooting a mighty mountain-top, darted against the sovereign of the Rakshas. And taking up that mountain-peak having its sides covered with innumerable trees, he hurled it at the night ranger. And seeing it descend swiftly, (Rāvana) in battle severed the same by means of gold-knobbed shafts. And on that gigantic peak furnished with fair sides filled with trees, falling to the earth, severed in pieces,—the lord of Rākshasas took up an arrow, resembling a mighty serpent and having the splendour of the Destroyer himself. And taking that shaft endowed with the vehemence of the wind, flaming like a fire aglow, and having the impetuosity of the great Indra's thunder-bolt, (Rāvana) hurled it in rage to compass the destruction of Sugriva. And even as the fierce dart discharged by Guha184 had pierced Krauncha,185 that shaft shot by Rāvana, rushing in violence at Sugriva possessed of a person having the touch of Sakra's thunder-bolt, pierced it. Thereat, agonised by the shaft, that hero, with his senses bewildered, dropped down to the ground with shrieks. And seeing him down on the earth bereft of his senses, the Yatudhanas were filled with rejoicing. And then Gavāksha and Gavaya, Sushena, Rishabha, Jyotimukha and Nala, uprooting crags and magnifying their bodies, rushed against the lord of Rākshasas. And the lord of Rākshasas with hundreds of shafts having sharpened heads, rendered their strokes fruitless. And then he rived those foremost of monkeys with showers of arrows having variegated golden knobs, and covered those fierce monkey-ranks with networks of arrows. And on being sore assailed and falling in consequence, those heroes, the monkeys, pierced with terrific arrows, and distressed with the shafts of Rāvana, emitting cries, sought the shelter of Rāma worthy of being sought. Then the high-souled and excellent bowman—Rāma,—taking his bow, at once sallied forth. And thereat, Lakshmana, approaching Rāma, with joined hands addressed him words couching prime import. \"O noble one, I alone am fit to compass the destruction of this wicked-minded one. I will slay him. Do thou, O master, permit me\". To him replied Rāma of exceeding energy, having truth for his prowess,—\"Go then, O Lakshmana, and put forth thy utmost exertions in the encounter. Rāvana is forsooth endowed with mighty energy, and his prowess in battle is wonderful. Without doubt, when enraged, he is incapable of being borne by this triple world. Do thou keep an eye on his shortcomings as thou shouldst watch thine own failings. Being always on the alert, thou must with thy eyes as much as thy bow protect thyself\". Hearing Rāghava's speech, Sumitrā's son, embracing Rāma, and saluting him and paying him his respects, went forth to battle. And (going unto the field), he found Rāvana, endowed with arms resembling the trunks of elephants,—wielding his dreadful and flaming bow, and covering with showers of arrows those monkeys, whose bodies had been swarming with shafts. And seeing Rāvana, the exceedingly powerful Hanumān—son unto the Wind-god—resisting that downpour of arrows, charged him vehemently. And coming at his car, the intelligent Hanumān, uplifting his right arm and terrifying Rāvana, said,—\"Incapable of being slain by gods, Dānavas or Gandharvas, Yakshas or Rākshasas,—Fear hath (at last) found thee, coming even from monkeys. This my upraised right arm furnished with five fingers, shall rob thee of thy soul long resident (in thy body)\". Hearing Hanumān's speech, Rāvana possessed of dreadful prowess, with his eyes reddened in wrath, said these words,—\"Strike thou swift maugre fear; and acquire lasting renown. And, O monkey, having (at first) taken the measure of thy might, will I finish thee\". Hearing Rāvana's words, the offspring of the Wind-god said,—\"(First) remember thou thy son—Aksha—slaughtered by me!\" Thus addressed, the exceedingly energetic lord of the Rākshasas possessed of prowess dealt a slap unto the offspring of the Wind-god. And struck with his slap, he shook momentarily. And staying for a moment and calling up fortitude, that magnanimous one administered a slap unto the foe of the immortals. And hit by the highsouled monkey, the Ten-necked one trembled, as trembleth a mountain during an earthquake. And witnessing Rāvana struck with a slap (by Hanumān) saints and Siddhas and celestials and the Asuras shouted in glee. Then attaining a little respite, Rāvana said,—\"Well done, O monkey. In prowess thou art a foe I pride in\". Thus addressed by Rāvana, the Wind-god's son said,—\"Fie on my prowess, seeing that thou breathest yet, O Rāvana. Strike at the same time, O perverse one. Why dost thou bluster? And then my blow shall despatch thee to the mansions of Yama\". And at the speech of the Wind-god's son, his ire flamed up. And then that one endowed with prowess, clenching his right fist carefully, let it alight amain on the monkey's chest. And hit at his spacious chest, Hanumān shook over and over again. And seeing the mighty Hanumān overwhelmed, that powerful car-warrior ascended on his car, approached Nila. And the powerful lord of Rākshasas—the Ten-necked one—made that general of forces—Nila—aflame with dreadful shafts entering into the vitals, resembling snakes. And assailed with shafts, Nila—leader of monkeys—with one arm took up a mountain-top and hurled it at the lord of Rakshas. And the energetic and high-minded Hanumān, attaining respite, eager for encounter, seeing (the fight between the Rākshasa and the monkey), wrought up with rage, said,—\"It is not meet for me to attack Rāvana—lord of Rākshasas—engaged with Nila\". And the highly powerful Rāvana, by means of seven shafts with sharpened points, hit at the mountain-top; and shivered in pieces, it fell (to the earth). And seeing that mountain peak shattered, that general of the monkey-forces—slayer of hostile heroes—flamed up in wrath like the fire at the universal wreck. And in that encounter Nila discharged Açwakarna trees, and Sālas, and mangoes in full flower, and various other trees. And Rāvana, getting at the trees, severed them (by means of his arrows), and poured on the Fire-god's son terrific showers of shafts. And assailed with fearful showers of arrows as with a mass of clouds, that one endowed with eminent strength, decreasing his dimensions, dropped on the top of Rāvana's banner. And seeing the son of the Fire-god descend on the top of his banner. Rāvana was fired with ire, and Nila shouted (thereat). And seeing the monkey (now) at the top of the banner, and (now) at the end of his bow, and (now) at the crest of his tiara, Lakshmana and Hanumān and Rāma were struck with astonishment. And also Rāvana endowed with exceeding energy, astonished at the lightness of the monkey, took up a wonderful flaming fiery weapon. And the monkeys seeing Rāvana bewildered, and delighted thereat, set up shouts. And Rāvana encaged at the shouts of the monkeys, with his heart overwhelmed with agitation, could not address himself to any effort. And then taking a fiery shaft and setting the same on his bow, the night-ranger gazed at Nila. And the exceedingly energetic lord of the Rākshasas said,—\"O monkey, by virtue of thy skill in illusion, thou art furnished with lightness. But, O monkey, if thou canst, preserve thy life. Thou transformest thyself into many shapes. Yet this shaft of mine discharged from my weapon, shall deprive of thy life thee that art preserving it\". Having said this, the mighty-armed Rāvana—lord of the Rākshasas—fixing his shaft on his bow, shot it at the general. And Nila, struck at the chest with that arrow, which had been shot (by Rāvana), burning, suddenly fell down to the earth. And by virtue of the greatness of his sire and also of his own energy, he went to the earth on his knees, but was not utterly deprived of life. And seeing the monkey deprived of his senses, the Ten-necked one, eager for encounter, riding a car emitting a rattle resembling the rumbling of clouds, darted against Sumitrā's son. And entering into the arena of fight and posted there flaming, the powerful lord of the Rākshasas, baffling (the foe), kept stretching his bow. And as that one of immeasurable prowess kept stretching his bow, Sumitrā's son of unflagging mettle, addressed him, saying,—\"O lord of night-rangers, do thou to-day try me in encounter. Thou ought not to strive with the monkeys\". And hearing Saumitri's speech uttered in a full voice, as well as the terrific twangs of his. bow-string, that Raksha—the king—approaching Sumitrā's son staying in the field, spoke unto him wrathfully,—\"O Raghu's son, by my luck hast thou of perverse sense, finding thy fate come within the range of my ken. This very instant, tormented with the springes of my shafts, thou wilt repair to the regions of Death\". Thereat, Sumitrā's son, without being overwhelmed with wonder (on witnessing Rāvana's prowess), addressed that one furnished with large and sharp teeth,—setting up roars,—\"O king, those who are (really) endowed with prowess, do not storm. O prince of sinners, in vain thou vauntest. O lord of Rākshasas, I know thy prowess and strength and energy and vigor. Here am I stationed, bow and shafts in hand. Come thou. What is the use of vain-glorious self-laudation?\" Thus accosted, the Raksha monarch, growing wroth, discharged seven shafts furnished with knobs. Thereupon Lakshmana split them up with sharp-pointed arrows having variegated golden knobs. And they suddenly severed like powerful serpents cut off, Lankā's lord came under the sway of passion, and discharged other whetted arrows. And Rāma's younger brother poured showers of arrows from his bow; and, planting himself at his post, cut off those arrows (of his adversary) by means of razors, and crescents, and excellent karnas and darts. And seeing his arrowy net-works rendered ineffectual, that enemy of the celestials—the king—was seized with wonderment, and again shot sharpened arrows. And Lakshmana also, resembling Indra the Great, setting on his bow sharpened, sharp-pointed, flaming, and luminous shafts, endowed with the dreadful vehement impetus of the thunder-bolt, discharged (them), to compass the destruction of the lord of Rakshas. And thereat the Rākshasa sovereign cut off those whetted arrows; and smote Lakshmana in the forehead with an arrow resembling the Fire of Dooms-day in energy,—which had been conferred on him by the Self-create. And Lakshmana, tortured with Rāvana's arrow, shook, loosely holding his bow; and then recovering his consciousness after undergoing extreme agony, he severed the bow of the foe of the foremost of celestials. And having cut off Rāvana's bow, Daçarathas son hit (him) with three sharp-pointed arrows. And the king smarting under the shafts, with much ado regained his consciousness. And the enemy of the immortals of terrific power with his bow severed, and himself hit with shafts, and his body covered with fat, and himself washed in blood, took up a dart conferred on him by the Self-create. And the sovereign of the Rākshasas and their lord in that encounter hurled at Sumitrā's son the dart resembling smoking fire, sending up living flames, and striking terror into the monkeys. And as it coursed on, Bharata's younger brother resisted it with arrows resembling a sacrificial flame. Yet the dart pierced into the broad arm186 of Daçaratha's son. And smit with the dart, that hero of the Raghu race, although possessed of strength, was aglow. And the king at once with his arms seized that one, who had been deprived of his senses. But he that could with his arms wield Himavān or Mandara or Meru or the triple world itself along with the immortals, could not (for all his strength) lift up Bharata's younger brother. And hit at his chest by the dart of Brahma, Sumitrā's son remembered that he was verily a portion of Vishnu himself. And pressing hard Sumitrā's son—that humbler of the hauteur of the Daityas, that thorn in the sides of the celestials—could not move him (from his place). And then the Wind-god's offspring waxing wroth rushed at Rāvana, and overwhelmed with rage smote at his chest with his clenched fist resembling the thunder-bolt. And boxed (by Hanumāna), Rāvana—lord of the Rākshasas—went down to the ground on his knees, and shook and dropped to the earth. And blood gushed out in streams from his mouths and eyes and arms; and staggered and senseless, he sat down on the platform of his car. And he was rendered insensible with his senses lost; and he knew not where he was. And seeing Rāvana endued with terrific prowess, rendered insensible in the encounter, saints and monkeys and gods with the Asuras set up shouts. And then the energetic Hanumān taking Lakshmana racked by Rāvana, with his arms brought him before Rāghava. And albeit incapable of being moved by the foes, (Lakshmana), on account of the friendship of the Wind-god's offspring as well as the high reverence in which he was held by Hanumān, became extremely light to the monkey. And then that dart, renouncing Sumitrā's son vanquished in fight, again sought its place in Rāvana's car. And the exceedingly powerful Rāvana, recovering his consciousness in that dread encounter, took up whetted shafts and seized a mighty bow. And that finisher of foes—Lakshmana—recovered the exercise of his senses, and had his entire person perfectly healed,—on his recalling that he verily was a part and parcel of Vishnu himself. And witnessing the mighty army of the monkeys and the redoubted heroes brought down in the conflict, Rāghava rushed at Rāvana. Thereat drawing near to him, Hanumān said unto him,—\"It behoveth thee to chastise the foe ascending my back, even as Vishnu chastiseth the enemies of the immortals, riding Garutman\". Hearing the words spoken by Hanumān, Rāghava at once got up on that gigantic monkey; and that master of men beheld Rāvana in battle. And seeing him, that highly powerful one darted against Rāvana, even as the enraged Vishnu had rushed against Virochana's son,187 upraising his weapons. And he sharply twanged his bow-string sounding like the terrific crash of thunder; and then in solemn tones, Rāma addressed the lord of Rākshasas, saying,—\"Stay, stay, having done me such wrong. Repairing whither, shalt thou, O powerful Rākshasa, attain respite? Even if thou shouldst seek Yama or Indra or the Sun—son unto Vivaçwān—or the Self-sprung or the Fire-god or Sankara himself,—or go to the ten cardinal points in ten portions,—yet shalt thou not, so resorting, attain deliverance. And (Lakshmana), going forth to the fight, hath been wounded with the dart and hath suddenly been stupified. But, O king of the Rakshas, to-day in conflict Death shall claim for his own thee and thy sons and grandsons. By me with my shafts have been slaughtered four and ten thousand Rakshas residing in Janasthāna, wielding excellent weapons\". Hearing Rāghava's words, the exceedingly strong lord of the Rākshasas, overwhelmed with a mighty wrath, recalling enmity agone, with burning shafts resembling the fire of Doom hit in encounter the exceedingly impetuous offspring of the Wind-god, who was bearing Rāghava. And although struck and resisted by the Rākshasa with arrows, the energy of that one, endowed by nature with prowess—increased greatly. And the exceedingly energetic Rāma, on seeing that foremost of the monkeys wounded by Rāvana, was mastered by wrath. And Rāma, closing with his enemy, by means of whetted arrow-points severed in pieces his car together with the wheels and the steeds, the banner, the umbrella, and the majestic streamer, as well as with the charioteer and the thunder-bolts and darts and swords. And then as the reverend Indra cleaveth Meru with his thunder-bolt, (Rāghava) swiftly smote on Rāvana's spacious and shapely chest with a shaft resembling Vajra and the thunder holt. And—that the king hero—who had not smarted nor shaken under the impetus of Vajra and the thunder-bolt,—assailed with the arrow of Rāma and agonised in consequence, shook and lost hold of his bow. And seeing him overwhelmed, Rāma took up a flaming half-moon, and with the same at once severed the sun-bright tiara of the high-souled sovereign of the Rākshasas. And Rāma in the encounter addressed the lord of Rākshasas, resembling a serpent bereft of venom, shorn of his splendour, like unto the sun shrouded (in mist),—without his wonted grace, and having his entire tiara riven—saying,—\"Thou hast (in battle) performed high and dreadful deeds,—and hast also (in the conflict) slain my foremost heroes. And therefore I know thou art fatigued. And for this reason it is that I will not with my shafts bring thee to the door of Death. Go thou. I know188 that thou art worn out with fight. Therefore, O king of night-rangers, enter Lankā. Having a little respite, do thou depart on thy car along with thy bowmen. Afterwards, mounted on thy car, shalt thou behold my power\". And thus addressed, the king, with his pride and joy defeated, with his bow severed, and his steeds and charioteer killed, himself smarting under shafts,—and having his crown splintered,—speedily entered Lankā. And on that foe of the deities and the Dānavas—the puissant lord of the night-rangers—entering (into Lankā), Rāma rendered the monkeys along with Lakshmana hale in that fierce conflict. And at the break-down of that foe of the immortals, the celestials and the Asuras, the ghosts and the Cardinal points, and all the mighty serpents together with the oceans and the creatures inhabiting earth and water, felt exceedingly delighted."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "And entering the city of Lankā, the king afflicted with the fear of Rāma's arrows, with his pride humbled, was undergoing great torments. And overpowered by the high-souled Rāghava, the king resembled an elephant defeated by a lion or a serpent defeated by Gāruda. And remembering Rāghava's arrows resembling a comet risen at the universal wreck, and of the splendour of live lightning, the Rākshasa-chief was aggrieved. And seated on a superb golden seat, Rāma, eying the Rākshasas, spoke,—\"Forsooth all the austere asceticism I have performed goeth for nothing, for although resembling the redoubtable Indra, I have been overcome by a mortal. And this dire speech of Brahma also reverts to my remembrance,—'Know thou that thy fear cometh from a human being. Thou art incapable of being slain by deities and Dānavas, Gandharvas, Yakshas, Rākshasas and serpents. But thou hast not asked for immunity from men.' And I deem even this son of Daçaratha as the occasion of my fear. And I was formerly cursed by that lord of the Ikshwaku line—Anaranya—saying,—'O worst of Rākshasas, a person shall spring in my race, who, O wicked-minded one, shall slay thee in battle along with thy sons and courtiers and forces and horses and charioteers.' And I was also cursed by Vedavati, who was formerly outraged by me. And she is (perchance) born as the exalted daughter of Janaka. And what had also been uttered by Umā and Nandiçwara and Rambha and Varuna's daughter,189 hath come to pass.190 And taking note of this, ye should strive (to the uttermost.) And let the Rākshasas be posted at the gateways, highways, and the walls. And do ye wake up that destroyer of the pride of the deities and the Dānavas—Kumbhakarna, endowed with unparalleled gravity, overwhelmed with the curse of Brahmā\". And seeing himself worsted and Prahasta also slain, that Raksha endowed with dreadful power issued his orders to that fearful force. \"Do ye vigilantly guard the gates and mount the wall. And do ye wake up Kumbhakarna come under the sway of slumber. And deprived of his senses through lust, he sleepeth secure. And the Rākshasa sometimes sleepeth nine, seven, ten, or eight months away. Of measureless might he hath slept for nine months. And foremost of all the Rākshasas in fight, that long-armed one shall speedily slay the monkeys as well as the princes. He is a very banner in battle, and the crown of all the Rakshas. But intent on common pleasure, Kubhakarna, with his senses stupified, sleepeth ever. I have been worsted in fierce fight by Rāma; but on Kumbhakarna being awakened, my grief shall go. If he doth not help me in such high peril, what shall I do with his strength resembling the strength of Sakra himself?\" Hearing the speech of the lord of the Rākshasas, the Rākshasas, bestirring themselves, went to the abode of Kumbhakarna. And desired by Rāvana, those feeding on flesh and blood went off hurriedly, taking perfumes and wreaths and a mass of food. And entering Kumbhakarna's charming cave having a wide gateway, measuring a yojana breathing around perfumes of flowers,—those highly powerful ones, pushed off by Kumbhakarna's breath, with the utmost energy they could summon up stood their ground and entered the cave. And then entering that charming cave having floors paved with gold and gems, those Nairitas endowed with great strength, saw that one of dreadful prowess, lying down. And then they together set about waking up the slumbering Kumbhakarna looking like a hill extended,—and sunk in profound slumber; with his body having its down standing on end; lying down; like a sighing serpent; rolling people191 with his powerful breath,—reposing; possessed of dreadful prowess; having a huge nose; of a person vast as the nether sphere; lying stretched at length; smelling of fat and blood; decked with golden angadas; and waring a diadem endowed with the splendour of the Sun. And (they) saw that subduer of enemies and foremost of Nairitas—Kumbhakarna. And then they piled up Meru-like animals for conferring rare gratification, and heaps of deer and buffaloes and boars. And the Rākshasas made an astounding heap of rice. And then the enemies of the immortals put up before Kumbhakarna jars of blood and various kinds of food, and smeared that repressor of foes with excellent sandal, and made him inhale perfumes and the aroma of wreaths. And they made (the place) rife with the incense of dhupa, and extolled that smiter of enemies. And then the Yātudhānas roared around here and there like clouds. And they winded conchs beaming moon-like. And they incapable of being beaten shouted in full chorus. And the night-rangers shouted and struck at their arms with their hands and began to pull him. And for rousing Kumbhakarna, mighty was the din that they raised. And hearing those loud sounds of conchs and drums and panavas; and those proceeding from persons striking at their arms with their hands; and leonine roars,—rushing on all sides and riving the very heavens,—birds suddenly dropped down. And when the high-souled Kumbhakarna sleeping soundly did not awake at that terrific tumult, the Rākshasas took up Bhushandis192 and maces. And then the Rākshasas, drawing near, smote Kumbhakarna sleeping sweetly in the chest with mountain-peaks, maces and clubs. But the Rākshasas could not stay before Kumbhakarna owing to the hurricane heaving at his breath. Then tightening their cloth193 (about their waist), those Rākshasas of dreadful prowess sounded mridangas and panavas, conchs and kumbhas. And ten thousand Rākshasas together surrounded that one resembling a heap of dark-blue collyrium and fell to rousing him. But albeit assailed with shouts and smit with weapons, he did not wake up. And when they succeeded not in rousing him, they more than ever exerted themselves. And then they smote him with horses and camels, and mules and snakes, rods and lashes and hooks, and with might and main sounded kettledrums and conchs and mridangas. And they struck his body with innumerable huge blocks of wood. And summoning up their dearest energy, they dealt him blows with maces and clubs. And at that mighty uproar, entire Lankā was filled with her woods and hills; yet he did not wake up. And then they simultaneously sounded a thousand kettle-drums beaten with sticks of polished gold. And coming under the sway of the curse,194 when that one sunk in slumber did not wake up, the night-rangers were wrought up with wrath. And overcome with choler, they endowed with dreadful prowess addressed themselves vigorously to awakening him; and others put forth their energy. And others smote the kettle-drums, and others set up loud cries. And others cut off his hair, and others bit his ears. And others poured into his ears a thousand vessels of water. But Kumbhakarna come under the spell of a mighty slumber did not wink. And others—strong ones—armed with poniards (kutas) and maces, made their poniards and maces alight on his person. And struck with sataghnis bound with cords,195 that huge-bodied one did not wake up. And then when a thousand elephants rushed against his body, recovering his consciousness, he awoke. And assailed with mountain-peaks and trees descending on his body, he, without minding those tremendous blows,—on sleep having been dispelled, suddenly got up, yawning,—suffering the pangs of hunger. And then that night-ranger resembling an elephant or a serpent or a mountain-peak, casting about his arms superior in force to the thunder-bolt itself, and opening his deformed mouth like unto that of a mule, yawned (again and again). And as he yawned, his mouth resembling the subterraneous regions, looked like the Sun stationed at the summit of Meru. And that night-ranger possessed of unwieldly strength woke up, yawning. And the breath that he breathed resembled a storm raging in a mountain. And then as he sat up, Kumbhakarna's form appeared like that of the Destroyer himself at the universal wreck,—intent upon consuming all creatures. And the large eyes of that one, resembling a live flame and endowed with the splendour of lightning, appeared like a pair of glowing planets. And then they pointed unto him all those heaps of edibles, various and profuse,—bears and buffaloes,—and that powerful (Rākshasa) fell to. And hungering, he fed on flesh and athirst, drank blood. And then that enemy of Sakra drank vesselfuls of fat and blood. And concluding that he was replete, the night rangers came up; and bowing down their heads, stood circling him on all sides. And then with his eyes discolored and drooping from drowsiness, he casting his eyes around, addressed those night-rangers. And that foremost of Nairitas cheered all those Nairitas; and surprised at his having been roused,—spoke unto the Rākshasas,—\"Why, being honored, have I been awakened by you? Is it well with the king? Or hath any fear sprung up here? Or hath a mighty fear presented itself forsooth from among others; for which I have been speedily awakened by you? This very day will I uproot quite the fear of the sovereign of the Rākshasas. I will split up the great Indra himself,—or make Fire himself give up his heat. One doth not awaken my like for a light cause. Therefore do ye give the real truth of the cause of your awakening me\". Thereat a minister of the king, named Yupāksha, with joined hands said unto that humbler of foes—Kumbhakarna—wrought up with wrath, who was thus speaking,—\"No fear anywise springs to us from the Deities. But, O king, a great fear doth cross us, coming from a mortal. And never fear so cometh unto us anywise from Daityas or Dānavas, as it hath arrived from a man, O king. This Lankā hath been hemmed in by monkeys resembling mountains. And terrific is the terror that cometh even from Rāma scorched with fire springing from the ravishment of Sitā. Ere this by a single monkey was this splendid city burnt down. And the prince Aksha hath been slain along with his following and elephants. And that thorn in the sides of deities, that lord of the Rākshasas—Pulasta's son himself—hath been set free in conflict by Rāghava endowed with the splendour of the Sun,—saying—-'Go thou.' And what had been done unto the king by neither the gods nor the Daityas nor yet the Dānavas, hath been done by Rāma; and he hath been set free, having come to a pass imperilling his life\". Hearing Yupāksha's speech and hearing of the defeat of his brother, Kumbhakarna, with his eyes whirling, spoke unto him, saying,—\"To day, O Yupāksha, after vanquishing in battle the monkey-army together with Lakshmana and Rāghava, shall I see Rāvana. And I shall regale the Rākshasas with the flesh and blood of the monkeys, and myself drink the blood of Rāma and Lakshmana\". Hearing his words as he haughtily spoke thus with his spirit of insolence magnified by much, that foremost of the Nairita soldiers, Mahodara, with joined hands observed,—\"O long-armed one, having at first heard Rāvana's words and considered their justice or otherwise, thou wilt afterwards defeat the foe in fight\". Hearing Mahodara's words, the exceedingly energetic and mighty (Kumbhakarna) surrounded by the Rākshasas, prepared to depart. And having roused from his slumbers that one of terrific prowess having dreadful eyes,—the Rākshasas speedily arrived at the residence of the Ten-necked one. And presenting themselves before the Ten-necked one seated on a superb seat, all the night-rangers spoke with joined hands,—\"O lord of the Rākshasas, thy brother, Kumbhakarna, hath been roused. Shall he march from there; or wilt thou see him come here?\" Thereat, Rāvana, pleased, spoke unto those Rākshasas who had presented themselves,—\"I wish to see him here, and do ye honor him fittingly\". Thereat, saying 'So be it', the Rākshasas, directed by Rāvana, going back, spoke unto Kumbhakarna,—\"That foremost of all the Rākshasas—the king—wisheth to see thee. So mind thou going, and gladden thy brother\". And the irrepressible Kumbhakarna possessed of prodigious prowess, learning the mandate of his brother, saying,—'So be it,'—rose up from his bed. And washing his face, and having bathed, that one, feeling refreshed and enjoying exceeding exhilaration of spirit,—wishing to drink, urged (the Rākshasas) to bring the nerve-conferring draught. And then the Rākshasas, at the command of Rāvana speedily procured wine and various kinds of viands. And having drunk two thousand vessels (of wine), he prepared to go. And slightly swolen and flushed, Kumbhakarna, attaining access of strength and fire, waxed wroth, and resembled the Doom and Destroyer—Yama himself. And striding to the residence of his brother backed by the Raksha force, Kumbhakarna shook the earth with his tread. And illuming the highway with the splendour of his person, like the thousand-rayed (Sun) discovering the earth with his rays, (Kumbhakarna) went on, engirt around by joined hands resembling wreaths,—like Satakratu196 going to the abode of the Self-sprung. And suddenly seeing that slayer of foes of immeasurable prowess, resembling a mountain-summit,—walking along the highways, the wood-rangers stationed outside (the monkey-camp), along with the leaders of bands, were seized with affright. And then some sought the shelter of Rāma, worthy of being so sought; and some, stricken (with panic), dropped to the earth; and some, suffering (from fear), lied to the cardinal points; and some through stress (of apprehension) lay down on the ground. And seeing that one resembling a very mountain-peak, decked with a diadem, seeming to touch the Sun himself with his energy, of colossal altitude, and wonderful to behold,—the wood-rangers, tormented with fright, began to scamper on all sides."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "And then the exceedingly energetic Rāma possessed of prowess, taking his bow, saw Kumbhakarna, having a huge body and decked with a diadem. And seeing that foremost of Rākshasas looking like a mountain; filling all the heavens as formerly Nārāyana had done; resembling clouds charged with rain; and adorned with golden angadas,—the mighty army of monkeys began to run away at the top of its speed. Seeing the army scamper and the Rākshasa swelling, Rāma struck with surprise, said unto Bibhishana,—\"Who is that tawney-eyed one, decked with a diadem, and looking like a hill? And in Lankā the hero appeareth like a mass of clouds embosoming lightning. And alone he seemeth like an ensign of the Earth; and seeing him the monkeys dart away hither and thither. Tell me who he is,—whether a Raksha or an Asura. The like of him mine eyes had never before lighted on\". Accosted by the king's son—Rāma of untiring deeds—the exceedingly wise Bibhishana said unto Kākutstha,—\"By whom in battle Vivasçwata's offspring197 and Vāsava himself had been vanquished, this is he—the wondrous powerful Kumbhakarna—son unto Viçravān. No Rākshasa is there that equalleth this one in size. O Rāghava, this one in battle hath brought down Dānavas and Yakshas and Serpents198 and flesh-feeders and Gandharvas and Vidyādharas and Pannagas199 by thousands. The immortals themselves thinking the dart-handed and fierce-eyed Kumbhakarna possessed of great strength, as the Destroyer himself,—were overwhelmed with stupor and were foiled in their exertions to slay him. The exceedingly powerful Kumbhakarna is mighty by nature: the strength of other redoubtable Rākshasas is owing to boons obtained by them. As soon as this high-souled one was born and was a babe, he began to devour up countless creatures by the thousand. And on these having been devoured, creatures, afflicted with affright consequent on those having been eaten up, sought the shelter of Sakra and told him what had happened. And thereat the great Indra, waxing wroth, smote Kumbhakarna with the whetted levin. And hit at with Sakra's thunderbolt, that high-souled (hero) shook, and in wrath set up roars. And hearing the roars of the Rākshasa—Kumbhakarna—as he kept crying, creatures, seized with fear, were greatly agitated. And thereat, enraged with the great Indra, the mighty Kumbhakarna plucking a tusk of Airāvata, hurled it at Vāsava's chest. And with blood overflowing his person, Vāsava looked as if aflame. And thereat, all of a sudden the gods and the Brahmarshis and the Dānavas were dispirited. And then they informed the lord of creatures touching the ravages of Kumbhakarna, and informed the gods about Kumbhakarna's devouring up creatures, destroying asylums and outraging others' wives. \"If this one devour creatures constantly, in a short space the world would be empty of any\". Hearing Vāsava's speech, the Great-father of all called up200 the Rākshasas and saw Kumbhakarna (before him). And seeing Kumbhakarna, Prajāpati201 was seized with exceeding great fear. And then, pacifying Kumbhakarna, the Self-sprung addressed him, saying,—\"Forsooth for compassing the destruction of creatures, hast thou been begot by Paulasta.202 Therefore from this day forth, thou shalt lie down as one dead\". Stricken with the curse of Brahma, Kumbhakarna fell down before the Lord. Then, extremely agitated, Rāvana said,—\"Thou hewest down a golden tree when about to bear fruit. O lord of creatures, thou ought not to curse thus thine own grandson. Thy words will never go for naught; sleep he will, without doubt. But do thou appoint a time for his sleeping and one for his awaking\". Hearing Rāvana's speech, the Self-sprung said,—\"Having slept for six months, he shall wake for one day. And for a single day, that hero, coming under the influence of hunger, shall range the earth, opening his mouth wide open, and devouring people like a fire that hath spread far and wide. And now king Rāvana struck with terror at thy prowess, encompassed with peril, hath waked up Kumbhakarna. And that hero possessed of dreadful prowess, wrought up with high wrath, sallying forth from his camp, rusheth about, eating up monkeys. And soon as the monkeys see Kumbhakarna, they fly away. And How can they resist in battle the enraged Kumbhakarna? Do thou tell the monkeys this is an uplifted engine. Thus assured, the monkeys shall take heart\". Hearing Bibhishana's words informed with reason and tending to the good (of the monkeys), Rāghava then addressed general Nila; saying,—\"Let you, monkeys, equipped with weapons and holding hill-tops in your hands,—and furnished with mountain-summits and trees and rocks, stay, occupying the highways and the bridges\". Thus instructed by Rāghava, that powerful monkey, Nila—general of the forces—accordingly issued his orders to the monkey-hosts. And then Givāksha and Sarabha and Hanumān and Angada, themselves endowed with the splendour of mountain-summits, taking up mountain-tops, drew towards the gateway. And hearing Rāma's words,203 the heroic monkeys inspired with intrepidity, fiercely fell on the foe with trees. And then that dreadful army of monkeys, upraising crags and holding trees in their hands, appeared like mighty masses of scowling clouds bordering a mountain.204"

  "Yuddhakāndam": "And that tiger-like Rākshasa possessed of prowess, (still) under the influence of slumber, strode along the picturesque highway. And that exceedingly unconquerable one, surrounded by thousands of Rākshasas, went on, showered with blossoms from the houses (standing by). And then he saw the grand and graceful residence of the lord of the Rākshasas, having golden networks and sun-bright to behold. And entering the mansion of the Rākshasa sovereign, like the sun entering into a mass of clouds, he saw his elder brother seated at a distance; even as Sakra sees the Self-sprung seated. And Kumbhakarna surrounded by numbers of Rākshasas, entered his brother's abode, making the very earth tremble with his tread. And arriving at the abode and passing the entrance, he saw his superior anxiously seated on the car, Pusphaka. Seeing Kumbhakarna come, the Ten-necked one, exceedingly rejoiced, raised him up and drew him near himself. And then the exceedingly mighty Kumbhakarna saluted the feet of his brother and said,—\"What dost thou say?\" Thereat, delighted, Rāvana, springing up, again embraced (his brother). And embraced (by his brother), and duly greeted by him, that brother (of Rāvana)—Kumbhakarna seated himself on a shining and superb seat. And seating himself on that seat, the wondrous powerful Kumbhakarna, with his eyes reddened in wrath, addressed Rāvana, saying,—\"O king, why, honoring me, hast thou awaked me? Tell me, whence springeth thy fear? And who shall be a ghost?\"205 Thereat, Rāvana, waxing wroth, and with his eyes rolling in rage, said unto Kumbhakarna, seated,—\"O highly powerful one, thou hast slept away a long space of time. And having been asleep, thou dost not know the great fear of mine springing from Rāma. This graceful son unto Daçaratha possessed of strength, along with Sugriva, having crossed the ocean, is destroying our race. Alack! see in own Lankā, woods and forests have been flooded with an ocean of monkeys coming without any ado by the bridge (which they have constructed). Those Rākshasas that were prime, have been slain in battle by the monkeys; but I find no destruction of the monkeys in fight. Nay, the monkeys have never been before even vanquished (by the Rākshasas) in battle. And therefore hath this fear sprung up (in my heart). Save me from this, O exceedingly powerful one. Do thou now destroy these. It is for this that I have roused thee. Do thou, favoring me, whose exchequer is empty, save this city of Lankā, having only young folks and the aged left. And, O long-armed one, do thou perform thy dearest acts in behalf of thy brother. And, O subduer of enemies, I had never before said so unto my brother. In thee is my affection and great is the probability of thy succeeding. In the wars of the celestials and Asuras, O foremost of Rākshasas, countless were the celestials that thou as an antagonist hadst beaten. Therefore, O thou of dreadful strength, summon thy entire energy. Him find I not among all beings, who is thy peer in prowess. And, O lover of battle! O dear unto friends, as thou likest, do this beloved good office, this prime benefit, unto me. By thy own energy, smite the hostile hosts, even as a mighty and strong wind (scattereth away) autumnal clouds."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Hearing the lament of the king of Rākshasas, Kumbhakarna, laughing, said,—\"That evil which on the occasion of the conclave we had seen, hath befallen thee, who hast passed by what was fraught with thy good. Even as a sinner reapeth perdition, verily hath the fruit of thine unrighteous act found thee. At first, O mighty king, thou didst not ponder over this course of conduct; nor, from pride of prowess, didst thou at all take note of the evil thereof. He that doeth last what should be done first, and first what should be done last, is ignorant of what is prudence and what not. Acts not performed in harmony with season and place, like unto acts performed counter to season and place, are the occasions of misery, and resemble clarified butter poured into fire that hath not been sanctified. He stayeth well in the path that, in consultation with his counsellors, ascertained the five ways touching the three kinds of action.206 The king that aided by his own intelligence as well as his counsellors acteth after reflection in consonance with the science of polity, that distinguished his friends (from his foes), and, lord of the Rākshasas, that seasonably207 pursueth righteousness, or profit, or desire,—or any two, or all these combined,—truly hath understanding.208 But the king or the heir-apparent, that, having heard what is prime among the three, doth not understand, hath spent his time in vain on his erudition. He that, controlling his own self, consulteth with his counsellors seasonably touching gift, forbearance, difference and prowess, as well as virtue, profit and desire,—doth not in this world come by calamity. Perceiving the fair fruit (of a line of action) accruing to him here, a king should act in consultation with counsellors endowed with intelligence and versed in the import of things. Not understanding the sense of the scriptures, persons possessed of beastly intelligence,—entering into the heart of their counsellors,—are inspired with a desire of speaking out of sheer volubility.209 Albeit uttered needfully, the speech of those that are ignorant of learning and the knowledge of the sense of things,—and who are intent upon attaining abounding affluence,—should not be acted upon. And those—spoilers of business—who from recklessness talk of pernicious as if profitable,—should certainly be rejected as counsellors. Some counsellors—destroyers of their masters—joining intelligent enemies (of their lords), act in a way opposed to their interests in this world. Their lords, at the hour of consultation, by their behaviour should know these counsellors—enemies in the guise of friends—who have been won over (by the opposite party). Even as the fowls of the air enter the hole in the Krauncha,210 enemies find an easy entrance into the shortcomings of him that is fickle211 and that rusheth into act without heed. He that disregarding his foe, omitteth to guard himself, cometh by disasters and loseth his place. Even what had been advanced by thy beloved212 and my younger brother, is fraught with our welfare. Do thou now what thou wishest\". Hearing Kumbhakarna's words, the Ten-necked one knit up his brows, and, wrought up with wrath, said unto him,—\"I am worthy of being honored by thee, like thy superior. What needs this verbal travail? Do thou what is fit. Vain is the mention now of what I did either through stupor or delusion or pride of prowess. Now bethink thee of what is proper. Do thou through thy prowess assuage the sorrow of mine springing from my impolitic conduct, if thou cherishest any feeling for me, if thy strength stayeth, and if thou deemest this business of mine as by far more momentous unto thee. He is a friend that succoureth one fallen in distress and is undergoing affliction; and he acts friendly that helpeth a person lapsing from the path of morality\". As he was speaking thus in words sedate yet severe, Kumbhakarna, concluding that Rāvana was delighted, made his remarks mildly. And seeing his brother extremely sorry, Kumbhakarna, pacifying him, gently said,—\"O king, intently hear my words, O repressor of foes! O lord of Rākshasas, banish this sorrow, and casting away thy wrath, return thou to nature. And, O king, so long as I live, thou must not suffer thy heart to fare thus. Him will I slay for whom thou grievest. But whatever condition thou mayst be in, I must tell what is for thy welfare; and therefore from sentiment of friendship as well as from fraternal affection I have spoken thus unto thee, O king. And what a friend from affection should do at a time like this, I shall do the same. See the havock I spread among the foes in fight. And, O long-armed one, behold, on Rāma having been slain by me on the edge of battle along with his brother, the monkey-army in headlong flight. And to-day seeing Rāma's head brought by me from the field, be thou, O long-armed one, happy; and let Sitā be overwhelmed with woe. And let those Rākshasas in Lankā who have had their kindred slain (in battle), see that dear sight—Rāma slain (in fight). And to-day shall I slaying the enemies in battle, wipe the tears of those who mourn their friends slain and are overwhelmed with grief. To-day behold the lord of monkeys—Sugriva—resembling a mountain or a mass of clouds lighted up by (the living) sun,—lying stretched on the field. But why, O sinless one, albeit comforted by these Rākshasas eager for slaying Daçaratha's son, as well as by me,—dost thou persist in thy sorrow? Rāghava forsooth shall slay thee after slaying me. But, O lord of Rākshasas, I cannot come by grief213 (at Rāghava's hands). O repressor of foes, do thou now command me, O thou of unparalleled prowess, thou needst not thyself face the foe in fight. I shall abolish thy foes endowed with redoubted might. If even Sakra himself, and Yama, and the god of Fire, and the god of Wind, and Kuvera, and Varuna—shall range themselves against me, them shall I encounter in fight. Purandara himself is seized with fright at sight of me, having a body measuring a mountain,—equipped with sharpened spears,—furnished with sharp teeth,—and setting up shouts. And who wishing to save himself shall be able to stay before me as I casting away my weapons keep pounding my enemies with celerity? No need of the dart, or the mace, or the sword, or whetted arrows. I shall with my bare arms alone slay (Rāma) along with the thunderer himself. If Rāghava bear the impetus of my blows, then shall the vollies of my shafts drink his life-blood. Why, O king, while I remain, dost thou burn in anxiety? And I am ready to sally out for compassing the destruction of thine enemies. Cast off all terror of Rāma. I shall slay in battle Rāghava and Lakshmana and the exceedingly powerful Sugriva and the Raksha-destroying Hanumān, who made Lankā blaze. I shall eat up the monkeys present in the encounter. And signal is the celebrity that I shall confer on thee. And, O king, if thy fear springs from Indra or the Self-create, even the immortals shall measure their lengths on the earth when I am wrought with rage. And I shall subdue Yama himself and devour the God of Fire. And I shall bring down the very welkin garnished with stars. And I shall slay Satakratu and drink up the abode itself214 of Varuna. And I shall crush the mountains and rive the earth. And to day let all creatures as they are being eaten up, witness the prowess of Kumbhakarna, after he hath slept for a long time. Even the celestial regions do not suffice for me as my fare. I go for securing felicity ushuring in pleasures plenteous flowing from the destruction of Daçaratha's son. And slaying Rāma along with Lakshmana, I shall eat up all the foremost of monkey-bands. Make merry, my king; to-day drink Vāruni. Enjoy pleasures, banishing sorrow. And to-day on my having despatched Rāma to the mansion of Yama, Sitā shall come under thy control for good\"."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Hearing the speech of the huge-bodied, long-armed and mighty Kumbhakarna, Mahodara said,—\"O Kumbhakarna, although sprung in a noble line, thou art wondrous haughty and of a vulgar form; and thou art not everywhere competent to discern thy course. It certainly cannot well be that the king cannot distinguish between proper and improper; but thou hast from thy youth upwards been insolent; and thy joy is in talking perenially. But the foremost of the Rākshasas is versed in place and increase and injury,—and knoweth the duties touching season and place,—and how to advance his own party and lower that of the foe. But what person ever acteth according to what is proposed feebly215 by one having strength, yet of inferior intelligence, and who hath never respected the aged? And thou art not naturally competent to understand what thou thyself sayest touching the opposed virtue, profit and desire. Verily action is the spring of all agencies of happiness or misery; and it is only those that act either well or ill that reap the results of their acts. Virtue,216 and interest217 bring about emancipation as well as heaven and prosperity. But evil cometh from unrighteousness and harms spring therefrom.218 People reap the fruit of their acts in this world or the next; but the fruit of desire is reaped readily. Therefore should a king set about attaining his desire. And this also had we advised thee with our soul. And what is the harm that one should display his prowess before a foe? Dost thou show the reasons for thy taking the field alone? But I shall point thee out what is improper and unreasonable in this (proposed) course. How shalt thou alone vanquish that Rāghava who formerly routed in Janasthāna innumerable Rākshasas possessed of exceeding strength? Dost thou not to-day in the palace behold those powerful Rākshasas that had been beaten in Janasthāna,—cowed down in fear? Alas! thou wishest to awake Rāma,—son unto Daçaratha—knowing full well that he resembles an enraged lion or a sleeping serpent. But whom doth it behove to confront him ever flaming in energy, difficult of being approached when enraged,—and unbearable even like Death himself? On approaching the foe, this whole host itself shall be imperilled; and therefore, my child, thy marching alone doth nowise recommend itself to me. Who is there that, albeit weak bent on renouncing his life, wisheth to bring under subjection a foe that is powerful,—as if he would act with reference to one that is inferior? O foremost of Rākshasas, why dost thou wish to fight with him whose peer there is none among men, and who is equal to Indra and Vivaçwata himself?\" Having said this unto Kumbhakarna wrought up with wrath, Mahodara addressed that destroyer of creatures—Rāvana—in the midst of the Rākshasas,—\"Having already obtained Vaidehi, why dost thou delay? If thou wishest it, Sitā shall come under thy control. I have perceived a way as to how Sitā may smile upon thee. Do thou listen; and should it please thee, act thou accordingly. Do thou proclaim it about that I and Dwijibha and Sanhrādi, and Kumbhakarna and Vitardana—these five—are marching for compassing the destruction of Rāma. And we, marching out, shall battle with Rāma, putting forth our uttermost. And if we succeed in securing victory, no expedient need we resort to (or bringing Sitā round). But if our foe live after fight and we also having fought the fight, then shall we do what I conceive in my mind. We shall come hither from the field, bathed in blood, and having our bodies cleft with arrows marked with the name of Rāma. And we shall give out that both Rāma and Lakshmana have been eaten up by us. And then we shall hold thy feet, saying,—'Do thou gratify us.' Then, king, do thou through Gajaskandha publish it all round that Rāma hath been slain along with his brother and the army. And, O repressor of foes, (pretending to be) well pleased, do thou dispense—viands, and servants, and objects of enjoyments, and wealth unto thy retainers; and unto the many heroes and warriors distribute wreaths and attires and unguents. And do thou (simulating) delight, drink. And on this report—name that Rāma hath been eaten up by the Rākshasas along with his friends,—having spread round and round and entering (the açoka wood), and soothing and pacifying Sitā in solitude, allure her with corn and riches and gems. By this deceit, O king, working powerfully through Sitā's sorrow, she, albeit unwilling, shall, having lost her lord, come under thy control. Losing her charming husband, she from despair and female frailty, shall come under thy sway. Having formerly been brought up in happiness, she, although worthy of felicity, (ultimately) had come by misfortune. And now finding happiness to be in thy custody, she shall unreservedly come over to thee. In my opinion this is the properest course to follow. As soon as thou seest Rāma, evil shall befall thee. Remain here. Do not wish (to go to the field). By refraining from fight, thou shalt acquire great good. And, O lord of people, by conquering the foe without battle, thou without losing thy forces and putting thyself to peril, thou, O lord of earth, shalt attain fame and high religious merit, and prosperity and renown for ever and for ever."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Thus addressed, Kumbhakarna rebuking Mahodara, said unto that foremost of Rākshasa—his brother—Rāvana,—\"Even I shall remove thy great fear by slaying the wicked-minded Rāma. On thy foe having been slain, attain thou ease. It is not for naught that the heroes roar, like unto clouds containing no rain.219 Behold thou their roaring resulting in action in the field! Heroes do not vaunt; but without boasting of their prowess in speech, they perform feats difficult of being achieved. O Mahodara, what thou sayest is ever acceptable only to kings that are incompetent, and foolish, pluming themselves on their knowledge. All the affairs of the monarch have been wrecked by you—cravens in fight,—sleek-tongued,—following the king (fawning) ye have made Lankā contain only the king, the treasury is lean; and the forces have been slain. By the king ye have done like foes in the guise of friends. For repairing in mighty conflict the wrong that ye have perpetrated, I am about to set out for battle for routing the enemy\". Thus addressed by the intelligent Kumbhakarna, the lord of Rākshasas, laughing answered,—\"Sure this Mahodara is affrighted at Rāma. And therefore, my child, O thou versed in warfare, he doth not relish battle. Like thee have I none either in friendship or strength. Therefore, O Kumbhakarna, go for destroying the foe and securing celebrity. I have waked thee up that wast lying down, in order that thou mightst destroy the enemy. O subduer of foes, perilous is the time for the Rākshasas. Go forth, grasping thy spear, like the noose-handed Destroyer himself. Do thou devour up the monkeys as well as the princes possessed of the energy of the Sun himself. On seeing thy form, the monkeys shall flee away; and the breasts of Rāma and Lakshmana shall be riven\". Having spoken thus unto Kumbhakarna endowed with prodigious might, that foremost of Rākshasas—the exceedingly energetic Rāvana—felt as if he had received life over again. And well acquainted with Kumbhakarna's might, and knowing his prowess, the king felt delighted, like the cloudless Moon. Having been thus accosted, that highly powerful one, went out cheerfully.220 And hearing the king's speech, he made ready for fight. And he took a whetted dart, destructive to foes on account of its impetuous vehemence; entirely made of black iron; flaming; decorated with garniture, of shining gold; looking like Indra's açani; ponderous as the thunder-bolt; capable of destroying gods and Dānavas, Gandharvas, Yakshas and Pannagas; adorned with festoons of crimson flowers; and belching forth flames. And taking that huge dart decked with the blood of foes; the wondrous energetic Kumbhakarna spoke unto Rāvana, saying,—\"I shall go alone: let this mighty host remain here. To-day hungry and enraged, I shall devour up the monkeys. Hearing Kumbhakarna's words, Rāvana said,—\"Go thou, surrounded by the forces bearing darts and maces in their hands. The monkeys are high-souled, heroic and well-skilled in battle; and if they find thee alone or unwary, they may slay thee with their teeth. Therefore do thou exceedingly irrisistible, go, environed by the forces; and destroy the entire party of the foes, who are bent upon doing harm unto the Rakshas\". Then starting up from his seat, the exceedingly energetic Rāvana hung on Kumbhakarna's neck a wreath stringed with gems in the centre. And Rāvana also decked that high-souled one with angadas, and finger-fences, and noble ornaments, and a chain resembling the Moon. And Rāvana adorned his person with garlands gorgeous and fragrant, and set ear-rings to his ears. And adorned with golden angadas and Keyuras and other ornaments of gold, the large-eared Kumbhakarna appeared like a fire fed full of sacrificial libations. And with his great dark girdle he seemed like the Mandara fastened by the serpent on the occasion of the churning of the sea. And donning on his impenetrable golden mail, splendid like lightning, and shining in its own brilliance, Kumbhakarna appeared like the monarch of mountains enveloped with evening clouds. Having all his limbs adorned with ornaments and bearing a dart in his hand, the Rākshasa resembled Narāyana in elation of spirits, when he covered heaven and earth and the nether regions with three paces. And then embracing his brother and going round him and bowing down the head unto him, that exceedingly powerful one went out. And Rāvana sent him with choice benedictions,—while he caused kettle-drums and conchs to be sounded and forces equipped with excellent weapons, to accompany Kumbhakarna. And high-souled mighty warriors followed that foremost of heroes with elephants and steeds and chariots sending out rattle resembling the rumbling of thunder. And mounting serpents and camels and asses and lions and leopards and deer and birds, (Rākshasas) followed the grim Kumbhakarna endowed with tremendous strength. And strewn with blossoms, and, with an umbrella held over him, that exceedingly terrible enemy of the Deities and the Dānavas, wielding a dart in his hand,—went out, maddened with the smell of blood. And countless footmen wondrous powerful and mighty and dreadful and fierce-sighted Rākshasas, carrying weapons in their hands, went in his wake. The Rakshas measuring each many a vyāma and red-eyed, and resembling masses of dark-blue collyrium,—went out upraising darts and swords and sharpened axes and bhindipālas and parighas and maces and huge tālaskandhas and irrisistible Kshapanis. And the exceedingly energetic Kumbhakarna endowed with prodigious strength sallied forth, assuming another form terrific and dreadful to behold. And the gigantic huge-faced and fierce Kumbhakarna, measuring an hundred bows in breadth and six hundred in altitude, having eyes resembling car-wheels, and resembling a towering hill, or a mountain burnt,—marshalling the Rakshas, said with a complacent countenance,—\"Like fire consuming insects, shall I to-day, wrought up with wroth, burn up one by one the bands of the flower of the monkey-forces. But the wood-ranging monkeys have not transgressed anywise unto the like of us. That species is the ornament of the gardens attached to our residences. The cause of the seige of the city is Rāghava along with Lakshmana. He being slain, all are slain. Therefore shall I slay him in battle\". As the Raksha—Kumbhakarna—was speaking thus, the Rākshasas sent up terrific shouts, as if making the very sea shake. As the intelligent Kumbhakarna sallied out speedily, dreadful were the omens that presented themselves on all sides. Clouds containing meteors and lightning looked dark like asses. And the earth shook with her oceans and woods. And fierce jackals began to cry, opening their flaming mouths. And birds began to wheel at the left. And as he marched a vulture alighted on his dart. And his left eye throbbed and his left arm shook. And a meteor dropped down with a tremendous crash. And the sun was bedimmed, and the air did not blow, enhancing pleasure. But without heeding these mighty omens that took place, capabale of making people's down stand on end, Kumbhakarna went out, urged on by the force of the Finisher. And leaping over the wall with his legs, that one resembling a mountain saw the wonderful array of the monkeys, resembling clouds. And seeing that foremost of Rākshasas resembling a hill, the monkeys began to disperse in all the ten cardinal directions like clouds driven by the wind. And seeing that terrific host of monkeys scattering in all directions, like clouds broken through (by winds), Kumbhakarna possessed of the splendour of clouds, from joy, emitted roars like clouds. Hearing those terrible shouts like unto the roaring of clouds in the welkin, innumerable monkeys dropped to the earth even as sāla trees that have their roots severed. And issuing forth for destroying the foe, the high-souled Kumbhakarna, equipped with a tremendous bludgeon, struck extreme terror into the monkey-ranks, like unto the Lord armed with the Fatal rod at the Universal wreck."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Having leapt over the wall, the exceedingly powerful and gigantic Kumbhakarna resembling a mountain-summit, speedily went out of the city. And then he sent up a mighty shout making the sea resound, and as if drowning the roar of the thunder and riving mountains. And seeing that fierce-eyed one, incapable of being vanquished by Maghavān or Varuna or Yama, the monkeys began to fly away. And seeing them scamper, the king's son—Angada—said unto Nala and Nila and Gavāksha and the mighty Kumuda,—\"Forgetting your lineage and prowess, whither do ye, exercised with fear, fly,—like inferior monkeys? Ye amiable ones, desist. Why should ye save yourselves? This Raksha doth not come to fight,—this is only a great phenomenon to affright. We shall by our vigor destroy this fearful phenomenon of the Rākshasas that hath presented itself. Therefore, let the monkeys desist. Cheered with much ado, the monkeys rallying, took up trees and advanced to the field of fight. And ceasing from flight, the wood-rangers waxing enraged, began to assail Kumbhakarna, like unto elephants in rut. And the exceedingly strong221 Kumbhakarna, attacked with towering mountain-peaks and crags and trees with flowering top, did not shake. And countless crags descending on his person, were shattered; and trees with flowering tops, being broken, fell down to the earth. And incapable of containing himself (through rage), Kumbhakarna on his part fell to agitating the ranks of the powerful monkeys, even as a fire breaking out burneth down a forest. And many a prime monkey, crimsoned and drenched (with blood) lay down (on the ground); and many, resisted dropped to the earth, like trees bearing coppery flowers. And without looking before or after, the monkeys bounded and rushed. And on being attacked by the Rākshasa with ease some of those heroes dropped into the deep, and some entered the wilderness. And some ran by the same way by which they had crossed the ocean; and some with pale faces darted into downs. And some of the bears ascended up trees, and some took shelter in mountains. And others dropped222 down; and some ran on. And some fell down to the earth, and some lay insensible223 as if dead. Seeing the monkeys break down, Angada addressed them, saying,—\"Stay we shall fight. Desist, ye monkeys. Going round this Earth place find I none where ye may rest. Stop ye all. What is the need of preserving your lives. Ye poltroons, if ye fly away leaving your arms behind, your wives shall deride you; and that is more painful to honorable persons than death itself. Born in long and noble lines, whither go ye, suffering from fear, like abject monkeys? When renouncing your prowess, ye fly away in fear, forsooth ye are base. Where now is gone that talk of yours anent your nobility and the welfare (of your king) which you had held in society. He that liveth, despised (of all), hear the reproach of being a craven. Therefore do ye follow the way frequented by the worthy, and cast off fear. We will either lie down on the earth, being slain in consequence of our shortness of days, and thus attain the region of Brahmā incapable of being attained by dastards; or achieve renown by slaying the foe in fight and slain in battle, we shall enjoy the wealth of the region of heroes. Like an insect coming to a glowing and flaming fire, Kumbhakarna, seeing Kākutstha, shall not away hence living. If we save our lives by flight, and if the many are brought down by one, we shall lose our fame utterly\". As Angada decked in golden angadas was saying this, the monkeys, flying away spake onto that hero words not worthy of being spoken unto an hero,—\"Great is the havoc that the Rākshasa—Kumbhakarna—hath spread amongst us. 'Tis not the time to stay: life is dear unto us\". Having said this the monkey-bands darted to the ten cardinal points; as they saw that dreadful and grim-eyed one approach. And as those flower of the forces were on the flight, those heroes were made to desist by Angada with words of comfort and hope pointing to the future. On being cheered by the intelligent son of Vāli, all the monkey-bands stood expecting his commands."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "And having desisted on hearing the words of Angada, those huge-bodied ones, regaining calmness, became (again) intent on fight. And attaining energy at the exhortation (of Angada), and summoning up their prowess, they stayed in the field agreeably to the words of the powerful Angada. And inspired with spirits, the monkeys, determined to face their fate, rushed into the conflict, and, casting away all care for their lives, entered into a furious fight (with the foe). And speedily upraising trees and gigantic crags, the huge-bodied monkeys charged Kumbhakarna. Thereat the mighty Kumbhakarna possessed of a prodigious person waxing wroth, taking up his mace let the same alight on the enemies. And attacked by Kumbhakarna, seven, eight hundreds and thousands of monkeys measure their lengths on the earth. And casting about his arms, he rusheth on, devouring sixteen, eight, ten, twenty or thirty. And he devoured (the monkeys) like Gāruda swallowing up serpents. And then cheered up with much ado, the monkeys meeting together, and taking trees and rocks in their hands, stood their ground in the van of battle. Then uprooting a crag, Dwivida—foremost of monkeys—resembling an extended mass of clouds rushed against (Kumbhakarna) having the aspect of a mountain-summit. And uprooting it, the monkey hurled it at Kumbhakarna. And without descending on him, the crag fell down amidst the army, and smashed steeds and elephants and cans and choice chargers. And then taking another mountain top, Dwivida hurled it at other Rakshas. And smit with the impetus of the peak, Kumbhakarna had his chargers and his charioteers slain; and the terrific field overflowed with the blood of Rakshas. And Rākshasa car-warriors by means of arrows resembling the Destroyer himself, cut off the heads of the foremost monkeys who had been setting up roars. And the high-souled monkeys also, uprooting giants trees, destroyed cars and horses and elephants and camels and Rākshasas.—And remaining in the sky, Hanumān discharged at Kumbhakarna's head mountain-peaks and rocks and various trees. And all those mountain-tops he cut off with his dart; and the mighty Kumbhakarna also baffled the shower of trees.—Then grasping his sharpened spear, Kumbhakarna darted against that terrific array of monkeys. And as he charged them, Hanumān armed with a mountain-peak, stood before him. And waxing enraged (Hanumān) vehemently smote Kumbhakarna with a gigantic crag. And overpowered by that, Kumbhakarna experienced great torments, and his body was covered with fat and blood. And then as Guha had pierced Krauncha with his fierce dart, Kumbhakarna the mountain-like smote the Wind-god's son in the chest with his dart resembling lightning or like a glowing mountain-summit. And having his mighty chest pierced in the mighty encounter, Hanumān, overwhelmed, and vomitting blood,—transported with wrath, set up roars resembling the roaring of the clouds at the universal disruption. And then, beholding him in torments, the Rakshas suddenly rejoiced, emitted shouts; and the monkeys aggrieved and overcome with fright, began to fly Kumbhakarna in battle. And then the powerful Nila, arranging his forces, discharged a mountain-peak at the intelligent Kumbhakarna. And seeing it descend, he dealt it a blow; and struck by the blow, the mountain-top was shattered in pieces; and dropped to the earth glowing and shooting living flames. And then Rishabha and Sarabha and Nila and Gavāksha and Gandhamādana—these five terrific monkeys—rushed against Kumbhakarna. And in the encounter those mighty monkeys began to sorely assail the huge-bodied Kumbhakarna with crags and trees and slaps and kicks and blows. But those blows seemed to him like touches224 and did not at all pain him. Then he fastened the vehement Rishabha with his arms. And agonised on being fastened with Kumbhakarna's arms, that foremost of monkeys, the dreadful Rishabha, fell down to the earth, vomitting blood by his mouth. And then the enemy of Indra smit, Sarabha with blow, and Nila, in the conflict with his thigh, struck a slap at Gavāksha. And suffering great pain in consequence of the blows (dealt by Kumbhakarna those monkeys), deprived of their senses and bathed in blood, dropped down to the earth like Kinçukas that have been cut down. And on those high-souled and mighty monkeys falling down, thousands of monkeys rushed at Kumbhakarna. And ascending a mountain-summit, those foremost of monkeys,225 possessed of the splendour of a mountain-peak, sprang upon him and tore him with their teeth. And those foremost of monkeys attacked the long-armed Kumbhakarna with their claws and teeth and blows and arms. And then with thousands of monkeys on him that extraordinary one that fearful Rākshasa—resembling a hill,—looked like a mountain with trees on it. And like Gāruda eating up serpents, that wondrous strong one, wrought up with rage, devoured those monkeys, seizing them with his arms. And cast by Kumbhakarna into his mouth resembling the nether regions the monkeys emerged from his nose and ears. And eating up the monkeys, that foremost of Rākshasas resembling a hill, growing wroth, and fired with rage,226 began to break the monkeys down.—And transported with passion, that Rākshasa, making the earth miry with flesh and blood, spread among the monkey-ranks like unto the fire at the a time of the Universal dissolution. And in that encounter, Kumbhakarna armed with his dart in his hand, resembled the thunder-handed Sakra, or the noose-handed Destroyer himself. And as a conflagration227 burneth up a withered forest in the summer, Kumbhakarna burnt that host of the monkeys. And thus beaten (by Kumbhakarna), those monkeys, with their ranks destroyed, the monkeys,228 racked with anxiety, began to cry in unnatural tones. And having innumerable monkeys slain by Kumbhakarna, the monkeys, aggrieved and their hearts riven with sorrow, sought the shelter of Rāghava. Seeing the monkeys broken in the terrific encounter, the son of the thunder-handed,229 darted impetuously against Kumbhakarna. And taking up a mighty crag, he momentarily setting up roars, and thereby terrorizing all the Rākshasas—followers of Kumbhakarna, he discharged the mountain-peak right against Kumbhakarna's crown.—And struck with that mountain-peak, Indra's enemy—Kumbhakarna—flamed up in fierce wrath. And the loud-throated Kumbhakarna, terrifying all the monkeys vehemently darted against the enraged son of Vāli; and then that wondrous strong one hurled his dart at Angada. And as the dart descended, that foremost of monkeys endowed with strength,230 and skilled in battle, evaded the weapon from his fleetness. And then swiftly springing up, he slapped (his antagonist) in the chest. And thereat that one resembling a hill, lost his senses. And recovering his senses, that exceedingly strong Rākshasa, dealt a blow at Angada; and the latter dropped down senseless. And on that powerful monkey falling down insensible, Kumbhakarna, taking his dart, rushed against Sugriva. And seeing the exceeding stout Kumbhakarna approach, the heroic king of monkeys—Sugriva—sprang up; and taking a mountain-top that one possessed of great strength darted against the mighty Kumbhakarna. And seeing that monkey, Kumbhakarna, stretching his limbs, stood before the lord of monkeys. And seeing Kumbhakarna, with his body laved in the blood of monkeys; and eating up mighty monkeys, Sugriva addressed him, saying,—\"Thou hast felled heroes done deeds difficult of being performed, and hast devoured the warriors; and thou hast thus attained renown. But let go now the monkey-army. What shalt thou do with the ignoble? Do thou, O Rākshasa bear the descent of this mountain\". Hearing those words of the monkey-king instinct with strength and fortitude, that terrible Rākshasa—Kumbhakarna—said,—\"O monkey, thou stormest, because thou art the grandson of Prajāpati231 and the son of the king of bears; and because as such thou art endowed with fortitude and prowess\". Hearing Kumbhakarna's speech, Sugriva whirling that mountain-peak, suddenly let it go; and with that rock resembling Vajra or the thunder-bolt, smote Kumbhakarna in the chest. And on coming in contact with his wide breast, that mountain-peak was at once shattered in shivers. And thereat the monkeys grew dispirited and the Rākshasa's ranks shouted in joy. And struck with the mountain-summit, Kumbhakarna was fired with wrath; and roared, expending his face. And then, whirling his dart resembling lightning displayed, he hurled it for compassing the destruction of the master of monkeys. Then swiftly bounding up, the Wind-god's son, resisting that whetted dart fastened with golden chains,—with his hands violently snapped it in twain. And placing the same on his thighs, (Hanumān) snapped that ponderous and terrible dart composed of black iron, and thereat the monkeys waxed delighted. And seeing the dart severed by Hanumān, the monkey-army, growing delighted, set up countless shouts and rushed in all directions. And the Rākshasa was seized with fear and turned away (from the field.) And the monkeys excessively delighted, set up loud shouts, and finding the dart broken, poured forth thanks to the Wind-god's son. Then the mighty-minded lord of Rākshasas seeing the dart thus severed, uprooted a peak from the Malaya and with it smote Sugriva. The king of monkeys struck with the mountain-peak fell senseless upon the field, and the demons finding him in this plight shouted out in great joy. Then Kumbhakarna coming to the wonderfully mighty master of monkeys, took him up and stole away from the field, as a violent gust of wind stealeth away a patch of cloud. Kumbhakarna, who resembled a mountain in loftiness of stature, while taking him away like a mass of cloud appeared like Sumeru overtopped with lofty peaks. Thus the lord of Rākshasas went on hearing thanks (from the Rākshasas) and shouts from the lords of the heavens, wondered at the capture of the foremost of monkeys. Thus taking him captive, that mighty one resembling Indra in puissance, thought his death would destroy the entire host of the opponents together with Rāghava. Then Hanumān, the shrewd son of Maruta, finding the whole host of monkeys scattered in all directions, as well as Sugriva captured by Kumbhakarna bethought himself—\"What ought to be done by me now that our king has been captured? I will doubtless do as befits me now—let me assume the shape of a mountain and kill the Rākshasas. Let me kill the mighty Kumbhakarna, splitting his body with my strong fist and thus relieve the master of monkeys—thus let the whole host of monkeys become delighted. Or, even when captured by the whole host of gods or Asuras or serpents he is mighty enough to extricate himself. Meseems, the lord of monkeys struck with dart in battle by Kumbhakarna has not yet recovered his senses. Else in a moment he would do the needful for himself as well as the monkeys. Should the relief of the mighty-minded Sugriva come from me, I should be incurring his displeasure and it would certainly lead to the loss of his reputation for ever; then I must wait a moment and see his own might displayed by himself when relieved. Meanwhile let me cheer up the monkey-host\". Thinking thus within himself, Hanumān, that son of Maruta, began to stay the mighty host of monkeys. In the meantime Kumbhakarna entered Lankā with Sugrira trembling, being honored with the showering of beautiful flowers from the sky, the buildings on the main roads and the town-gate. Then the mighty one (Sugriva) slowly recovered his senses with the shower of fried paddy and sweet scent and the sprinkling of water as well as with the coolness of the streets. Then that mighty-minded (Sugriva), caught in the arms of the powerful Rākshasa, having with difficulty come to his senses and surveying around him the streets of the town bethought himself:—\"When thus within the grasp of the enemy how can I take revenge? Or let me do what will be acceptable and advantageous to our army\". Then advancing all on a sudden, he with his nails and sharp teeth cut off the ears and nose of that lord of the enemies of the gods and split both his sides with the blow of his feet. And Kumbhakarna losing his ears and nose and having his sides split with nails and teeth grew angry, and becoming all covered over with blood, threw Sugriva to the ground and pressed him. Thus pressed upon the ground with main force and severely struck by the enemies of gods, he flew to the skies like a ball-rolling, and once more joined Rāma. The mighty Kumbhakarna having lost his nose and ears and drenched in blood, appeared like a mountain covered all over with streamlets. That huge-bodied Rākshasa, younger brother of Rāvana, terrible in appearance, resembling a mass of deep black collyrium, and covered all over with blood, appeared like an evening cloud; and (once more) made up his mind to appear in battle. Sugriva having thus escaped, that dreadful enemy of the king of the celestials in wrath again rushed to battle; and finding himself destitute of arms took up a fearful mace. And then that mighty-minded one, the Raksha Kumbhakarna, issuing out of the city began to devour the terrific host of monkeys, as doth the mighty fire eat up people at the end of a Yuga. On entering the mighty host of monkeys, the hungry Kumbhakarna, hankering after flesh and blood, ate up the monkeys, and with them, devoured many a Rākshasa and Pisācha by mistake. Thus, as Death devoureth creatures at the end of a Yuga, he destroyed the mighty monkeys. And he in wrath, taking up with one hand the monkeys along with the Rākshasas, hurriedly threw them into his mouth,—one, two three, or many at a time. And blood and fat flowed copiously down his body; and though struck by the monkeys with peaks of mountains, the mighty one devoured all those monkeys. And the monkeys as they were being devoured, saught the shelter of Rāma. And Kumbhakarna wrought up with wrath, chased amain hundreds of monkeys, eating up seven, eight, twenty, or thirty. And fastening (the monkeys) with his arms, he, devouring them, rushed on. And resembling the Destroyer of prodigious dimensions at the end of a Yuga, that one furnished with extremely sharp teeth, having his body covered with fat, marrow and blood, and coiling entrails about his ears, began to discharge darts. And at this moment, that subduer of hostile hosts and captor of the capitals of foes—Sumitrā's son—Lakshmana, growing enraged, entered on an encounter with the enemy. And Lakshmana endued with prowess shot seven shafts at Kumbhakarna's body; and next, taking up other arrows also discharged them (at his antagonist). And thereat that Rākshasa, smarting under the wounds inflicted by that weapon,232 cut it off (by means of a weapon). Thereupon grew enraged the powerful Lakshmana—enhancer of Sumitrā's joy. And then as the wind overspreadeth evening clouds, he with his shafts covered his233 shining and graceful mail entirely made of gold. And smit with arrows dight with gold, that one resembling a mass of dark-blue collyrium appeared beautiful like the ray-furnished Sun surrounded by clouds. Then that dreadful Rākshasa voiced like masses of clouds, scornfully addressed the enhancer of Sumitrā's felicity, saying,—\"By dauntlessly fighting with me, who have without ado brought down the Destroyer himself in battle, thou hast established thy heroism. Even by staying before me, who am equipped with arms in this encounter, and who in mighty conflict resemble Death himself, thou deservest to be honored. What shall I say of thy fighting? Not even that lord—Sakra himself—mounted on his Airāvata, and engirt by all the immortals,—had ever before stayed before me in the field. But to-day, O Sumitrā's son, albeit a boy, thou hast gratified me with thy prowess. Now taking thy leave, I wish to go to Rāghava. And as I have been well pleased in battle with thy vigour and strength and enthusiasm, I now wish to slay Rāma alone, who being slain, all are slain. On Rāma being here slain by me, the rest remaining in the encounter—them shall I undertake with my all-crushing vigour\". When that Raksha had spoken thus, (Lakshmana); Sumitrā's son, present in that contest, answered him laughing in terrible words, saying,—\"That thy prowess is incapable of being borne by Sakra and other celestials,—is true. It is not otherwise, O hero. To-day I myself have witnessed thy prowess. Yonder is Daçaratha's son—Rāma—staying like a moveless mountain\". Hearing this, that night-ranger—Kumhhakarna—possessed of immense might, disregarding Lakshmana and passing beyond Sumitrā's son, rushed against Rāma, making the earth tremble. Thereat Daçaratha's son, Rāma, employing a terrific weapon, discharged sharpened shafts at Kumbhakarna's breast. Thereat flames mixed with live embers shot out from the mouth of that enraged one suddenly rushing (against Rāma),—as Rāma pierced him (with his arrows). And on being frightfully pierced by Rāma's weapons, that foremost of Rākshasas, roaring wrathfully darted against Rāma, and pursued the monkeys in the conflict. And those shafts adorned with peacock's plumes, alighting on (Kumbhakarna's) chest, his mace, escaping his hand, dropped to the earth; and all his (other) arms also were scattered on the ground. And when that exceedingly powerful one saw himself deprived of all his arms, he began to spread a huge havoc by means of his clenched fists and hands. And with his body entirely covered with arrows and bathed in blood, he began to bleed like a hill overflowing with fountains. And fired with wrath and maddened with blood,234 he rusheth on, devouring monkeys and Rākshasas and bears. And that redoubtable one possessed of dreadful prowess, resembling the Reaper himself, whirling a mighty mountain-peak, hurled it aiming at Rāma. Thereat Bharata's elder brother, the righteous Rāma, ere that prodigious peak had alighted, severed the same by means of seven straight-speeding shafts wrought with gold. Intent on finishing Kumbhakarna, the virtuous Lakshmana, revolving many a means, (at last) spoke unto Rāma,—\"O king, this one knoweth not monkeys and Rākshasas,—maddened with the smell of blood, he eateth up his own as well as his enemies. Now let the foremost monkeys, putting forth their best, mount on him; and let the leaders of bands according to their rank, stand surrounding him. And then to-day this wicked-minded Rākshasa, oppressed with a mighty weight, will no longer be able to eat up any more monkeys\". Hearing the words of the intelligent prince, those exceedingly powerful monkeys with alacrity ascended Kumbhakarna. And Kumbhakarna mounted by those monkeys, waxing exceedingly enraged, shook them vehemently, even as mad elephants shake the drivers thereof. And Rāghava seeing them shaken, and concluding the Rākshasa to be wroth, furiously sprang forward, taking his bow. And with his eyes crimsoned with choler, the gentle Rāghava, as if burning up the Rākshasa with his eyes, rushed forth vehemently, summoning up all his impetuosity, thereby cheering up the leaders of bands that had been sore tried by the might of Kumbhakarna. And equipped with an excellent quiver and arrows, Rāma cheering up the monkeys sprang forward, taking a bow, resembling a serpent; terrific; having a stout string; and embellished in gold. Then surrounded by exceedingly invincible monkey-bands, that highly powerful hero, followed by Lakshmana, marched forth. And he saw the redoubtable and high-souled Kumbhakarna, with his body drenched in blood, and with blood-shot eyes; rushing against all, like unto an infuriated elephant of the cardinal points; pursuing the monkeys; wrought up with wrath; environed by Rākshasas; appearing like the Vindhya or the Mandara; decked with golden angadas; bleeding from his mouth; like clouds pouring showers; licking at the corners of his mouth laved with blood; smashing the monkey-ranks; and resembling Yama the Destroyer. And that best of persons, seeing that foremost of Rākshasas having the splendour of a living fire, stretched his bow to its full bent. And fired with wrath at the twang of his bow, that foremost of Rākshasas, inflamed with wrath,—not brooking that report, rushed against Rāghava. Thereat, the gentle Rāma, endowed with arms resembling the body of the sovereign of serpents, in that encounter addressed Kumbhakarna, like unto an elevated cloud and possessed of the splendour of a mountain,—as he darted forward, saying,—\"Come, O king of Rakshas! Let no grief be thine! Here I stay, taking my bow in my hand. Know me for the destroyer of the race of the Rākshasas—thou who in a moment shalt be deprived of thy senses\". Knowing that this was Rāma, (Kumbhakarna) laughed in frightful accents; and then, wrought up with wrath, rushed against the monkeys in the encounter. And as if riving the breasts of all the monkeys (present), the exceedingly energetic Kumbhakarna, laughing frightfully and in a terrific manner,—resembling the rumbling of clouds, addressed Rāghava, saying,—\"Take me not for Virādha, or for Kavandha, or yet for Khara. I am not Vāli or Māricha. I am Kumbhakarna, that am come. Behold my dreadful and mighty mace entirely made of iron. By help of this I had formerly brought down deities and Dānavas. It doth not behove thee to scorn me in that my nose hath been severed. I do not feel any the smallest torment in consequence of my ears and nose having been cut off. O tiger of the Ikshwaku line, O sinless one, do thou witness the prowess that is in my frame. And thereafter, when thou shalt have displayed thy prowess and power, shall I devour thee up\". Hearing Kumbhakarna's words, Rāma discharged (at him) shafts furnished with knobs. And smit with these having the impetus of the thunder-bolt, the foe of the celestials did not feel any pain or smart. And those shafts which had severed the seven stately sālas, and, to boot, had slain Vāli—best of monkeys,—they resembling the thunder itself—could not impart any pain to Kumbhakarna's body. And drinking up in his body those arrows resembling a shower, the enemy of the great Indra whirling his mace possessed of fierce vehemence, put out the arrowy discharge of Rāma. Then that Raksha whirling his mace washed in blood, capable of striking terror into the mighty hosts of gods and Dānavas, and possessed of fierce impetus,—made the monkey-army take to its heels. Then Rāma, taking a mighty Vāyavya weapon, used the same against the night-ranger; and cut off his arm with the mace. And having his arm cut off, he set up tremendous roars. And his arm with the mace, resembling a mountain-peak, cut off by Rāghava's arrows, fell in the midst of the army of the monkey-king, and destroyed that army.235 Thereat the monkeys remaining after those broken and slain,—dispirited, and having their limbs wounded,—moving aside, looked on the dreadful encounter between the Raksha and the lord of men. And then Kumbhakarna, having his arm severed, resembling the foremost of mountains with its crest hewn away by a mighty sabre, tore up a tree with his (remaining) arm and in the conflict rushed against the monarch of men. Thereupon with a shaft plated in gold, set upon a weapon of Indra, Rāma cut off his uplifted arm with a palm tree, looking like the body of a pannaga. And that arm of Kumbhakarna, being severed, dropped inert on the earth, like a hill, and crushed trees and rocks and crags and monkeys and Rākshasas. And Rāma, seeing that one shorn of his arms suddenly spring up, roaring,—took up two whetted crescents, and in the contest cut off the legs of the Rākshasa. And thereupon those legs (of his), making all sides and quarters and rocks and caves and the mighty main and Lankā herself and the army of the monkeys and the Rākshasas,—resound,—dropped down (on the ground). And having his arms cut off and his legs also severed, (Kumbhakarna), opening wide his mouth resembling in sheen the mouth of a mare, roaring swiftly darted against Rāghava,—even as Rāhu pursueth the Moon in the firmament. Then Rāma stuffed his mouth full of sharpened shafts having their feathered parts furnished with gold. And having his mouth filled; he could not articulate; but with extreme effort uttered indistinct accents and swooned away. Then Rāma took an arrow of Indra,—whetted and knobbed, impetuous as the wind, resembling the effulgence of the Sun, and like unto the very banner of Brahmā, or the Destroyer himself; and fatal to foes. And then Rāma hurled it at the ranger of the night. And thereat that weapon hurled by Rāma's arm, resembling a smokeless flame, lighting up the ten cardinal points with its own glory,—saught him that was possessed of the dreadful energy of Sakra's thunder-bolt. And therewith he (Rāma) cut off the head of the lord of Rakshas resembling a mountain-summit, furnished with prominent teeth,—from which the ear-rings had fallen off,—even as formerly Purandara had cut off the head of Vritra. And then Kumbhakarna's huge head deprived of the ear-rings appeared like the Moon seated in the midst (of the heavens) on the rising of the Sun in the morning.236 And struck with Rāma's arrow, the head of the Raksha resembling a hill fell down to the earth; and (in its fall) crushed edifices on the highways and gateways; and elevated walls also it bore down to the ground. And then that Raksha of gigantic proportions and vast to the view plunged into the deep; and crushing huge and mighty fishes and serpents, saught the depths. And on that enemy of the Brahmanas and gods, endowed with immense strength,—having been slain in battle, the earth shook and the mountains also; and from excess of joy the celestials shouted aloud. And those deities and saints and Maharshis and Pannagas, and celestials and (other) beings and birds and Guhyakas, together with Yakshas and Gandharvas,—all these who had stationed themselves in the welkin,—were rejoiced at the prowess of Rāma. And at his (Kumbhakarna's) great destruction, the intelligent adherents of the king of Nairitas,—aggrieved exceedingly, began to cry at the sight of that best of the Raghus, even as mad elephants cry at sight of a lion. And like unto the Sun emerged from the mouth of Rāhu, and destroying the darkness of the celestial fields,—shone Rāma in the midst of the monkey-army having slain Kumbhakarna in battle. And countless monkeys experienced the very height of delight; and on (their) foe of terrific strength having been slain, they with countenances resembling awaked lotuses paid homage unto the king's son—Rāghava—the sharer of good fortune. And as the monarch of the immortals had rejoiced on slaying the mighty Asura—Vritra—Bharata's elder brother rejoiced on having in battle slain that smiter of celestial hosts, Kumbhakarna in mighty conflict, never (before) vanquished in renowned encounters."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Seeing Kumbhakarna slain by the high-souled Rāghava, the Rākshasas conveyed the tidings to the lord of the Rākshasas—Rāvana; (and addressed him, saying), \"O king, that one resembling the Destroyer himself, urged on by Death,—having scoured the monkey-army and eaten up monkeys,—and for a while displayed his prowess, hath met with his quietus at the hands of Rāma exerting his energy. And with half his body immersed in the dreadful deep, thy brother, Kumbhakarna, with his nose and ears cut off, and blood besmearing his body,—with his head and limbs hewn away, and his body uncovered,—mountain-like blocketh up the gate of Lankā with his person,—and resembleth a tree that hath been consumed by a forest-fire\". Hearing the mighty Kumbhakarna slain in battle, Rāvana burning in grief, swooned away and dropped to the earth. And hearing their uncle slain, Triçiras237 and Atikāya—destroyers of gods and men,—began to weep, oppressed with sorrow. And Mahodara238 and Mahāpārçwa239 hearing of their uncle slain by Rāma of untiring deeds, were overcome with grief. Then regaining his senses with extreme exertion, that foremost of Rākshasas, distressed in consequence of the destruction of Kumbhakarna, mourned with his senses overwhelmed, saying,—\"O hero! O humbler of the pride of the foe! O mighty Kumbhakarna! Leaving me, thou through Destiny, hast gone to the abode of Yama. O exceedingly powerful one, leaving me (lone) whither dost thou wend, without extracting my dart as well as that of thy friends? Now really I am not, inasmuch as my right arm hath dropped. Backed by this one, I would not fear celestials and Asuras. How to-day forsooth hath such a hero—crusher of the hauteur of gods and Dānavas—resembling the Fire arisen at the hour of universal wreck,—been slain in fight by Rāghava? He who could not be harmed by the concussion of the thunder-bolt itself—how can he, smitten with Rāma's arrows, sleep soundly on the earth? These gods stationed in the sky along with the saints,—beholding thee slain in battle, are shouting in glee. Surely to-day the monkeys overjoyed,—finding occasion, will scale all the gateways and fortifications of Lankā. I have nothing to do with empire. And what shall I do with Sitā? And deprived of Kumbhakarna, I do not even wish to live. If I do not slay in encounter that slayer of my brother—Rāghava,—certainly death is even that which is good for me,—otherwise, this life is useless. This very day will I repair to that place where my younger brother is. Forsaking my brother, I forsooth dare not live for a moment; for the gods shall laugh on seeing me, who had formerly wronged them. But, how, O Kumbhakarna, thou having been slain, shall I conquer Indra? Now the beneficial words of Bibhishana have been verified. And as through blindness I did not accept the advice of that high-souled one, Kumbhakarna and of Prahasta, this disaster arisen, shameth me sore. And as I had disgraced the virtuous and graceful Bibhishana, this peril producing grief, hath been the consequence of my conduct\". Having thus piteously and long lamented Kumbhakarna, the Ten-necked one, with his inmost soul overwhelmed with sorrow, and sore distressed in consequence of grief,—fell down, knowing his brother—the enemy of Indra—slain in battle."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Hearing the lamentations of the wicked-minded Rāvana, overwhelmed with grief, Triçiras addressed him, saying,—\"O Sire, this second uncle unto us possessed of mighty prowess hath240 forsooth been slain in fight. But, O king, heroes never indulge in grief as thou doest O lord, thou certainly alone art competent to conquer the triple world. Wherefore then dost thou vent such sorrow like an ignoble one? Thou hast thy dart conferred on thee by Brahmā; and thy mail and thy weapon—the bow—and thy car yoked with a thousand asses, sending forth clatter resembling the rumbling of clouds. The deities and the Dānavas have by means of thy arms been terrified over and over again. And furnished with all arms, thou ought to chastise Rāghava. But stay at thy pleasure, O mighty sovereign, I will go out to battle; and even as Gāruda captureth serpents, will I capture thine enemies. And as Samvara was vanquished by the lord of the immortals, or Naraka by Vishnu, will I bringing down Rāma in battle make him sleep (in the field)\". Hearing Triçiras' words, Rāvana—lord of Rākshasas—urged on by Fate, considered himself as having regained his life. And hearing the speech of Triçiras, Devāntaka, and Narāntaka, and the energetic Atikāya also, were wrought up with martial enthusiasm. And then those foremost of Nairitas—the heroic sons of Rāvana—endowed with the prowess of Sakra himself—roared out, 'I will go,' 'I will go.' And all could range the sky, and all were skilled in illusion, and all were crushers of the pride of the immortals; and all were irrisistible in encounter. And all of them were endowed with superior strength, and all had achieved wide celebrity. They had never been heard of as having been beaten in fight even by the gods along with the Gandharvas, or the mighty serpents accompanied by the Kinnaras. And all were skilled in weapons and heroic; and all were versed in warfare. And all were possessed of the higher knowledge; and all had obtained boons. And then the king surrounded by those sons of his, appearing like celestials,—capable of injuring the force and fortune of the foe,—looked splendid like Maghavān environed by the immortals, humblers of the hauteur of mighty Dānavas. And embracing his sons and adorning them in ornaments,—he sent them to the field with his best benedictions. And Rāvana sent the brothers—Yudhyonmatta and Matta—for protecting the princes in the field. And then, saluting the high-souled Rāvana—destroyer of creatures,—and going round him, those huge-bodied ones marched forth. And furnished with every description of medicinal herbs and perfumes, these six Nairitas—foremost of their kind—endowed with great strength—burning for battle, marched forth,—Triçiras and Atikāya, and Devāntaka and Narāntaka, and Mahodara and Mahāpārçwa went out, urged on by Fate. Then Mahodara mounted the elephant—Sudarçana—sprung in the race of Airāvata, and resembling dark-blue clouds. And accoutred in every weapon, and decked with quivers, he looked splendid on his elephant like the Sun ascending the crest of the Setting-hill. And Rāvana's son—Triçiras—ascended a car yoked with excellent steeds, and furnished with every variety of arms. And having ascended the car, Triçiras bow in hand appeared beautiful like a mass of burning clouds having lightning and meteors, and crowned with Indra's bow.241 And dight with three diadems, Triçiras looked splendid in that superb car, like the monarch of mountains Himavān—with the three golden hills. And then that foremost of all bowmen—the powerful Atikāya—son unto the lord of Rākshasas—ascended the best of cars having excellent wheels and akshas, and yoked with excellent steeds,—and furnished with bottoms and holes; flaming with quivers and bows; and bristling with prāças and swords and blugdeons. And adorned with a crown plated with wrought gold and (other) ornaments, he looked like the Meru swimming in its own splendour And that powerful son of the king surrounded by the Nairitas looked lovely on that car like the thunder-handed (Deity) engirt by the immortals. And Narāntaka mounted a white steed resembling Uchchaiçrava, caparisoned in gold, having a large frame and endowed with the velocity of the Wind. And taking a prāça, Narantaka appeared like the energetic Guha mounted on the peacock, grasping his dart. And taking a bludgeon decked in golden ornaments, Devāntaka resembled Vishnu at the time of the churning of the ocean, holding the Darbhyā,242 and staying burthening (the earth). And the powerful Mahāpārçwa endowed with terrific energy, taking his mace, appeared like Kuvera holding in his hand a mace in the encounter. And like immortals issuing out of Amarāvati, they marched out with elephants and steeds and cars sending out clatter resembling the rumbling of clouds. And them followed high-souled Rākshasas equipped with mighty-arms. And those sun-bright high-souled princes decked with diadems appeared splendid like burning planets in the firmament. And the various gorgeous attires which they had worn resembled rows of cranes in the sky, looking like autumnal clouds. Resolved on dying or conquering the foe in fight, those heroes sallied out seeking encounter. And those high-souled ones, incapable of being repressed in fight, roared and shouted and discharged shafts and held them. And the earth shook as they sent up leonine roars and struck at their arms with their hands; and the sky seemed riven with the leonine roars of the Rakshas. And issuing out cheerfully, those foremost of Rākshasas endowed with great strength beheld that monkey-army staying with upraised rocks and stones. And the high souled monkeys also saw that mighty host of Rākshasas thronging with elephants, horses and cars, and ringing with hundreds of bell-lets; resembling dark-blue clouds; upraising mighty arms; and environed on all sides by Nairitas resembling flaming fire. And seeing that force advance, the monkeys, finding opportunity, upraising giant crags, momentarily set up shouts. And thereat, the Rākshasas, incapable of bearing those shouts, shouted in reply unto the monkeys. And again the monkeys shouted unto the Rakshas, who were unable to put up with that cry. And hearing that loud shout of the monkey-leaders, the mighty Rakshas incapable of bearing that noise expressive of exhilaration,—shouted still more dreadfully. And then diving into that dreadful Rākshasa army, the monkey leaders began to range it with uplifted rocks,—like unto mountains. And equipped with trees and stones, the monkeys enraged, ranged the Raksha army, now rising into the sky. and now coming down to the earth. And some among the powerful monkeys went about taking broad-shouldered trees. And the encounter that took place between the thronging Rakshas and monkeys was something terrific. And (the monkeys) began to pour a wonderful shower of trees and rocks and cliffs. And the monkeys of dread prowess were resisted with vollies of shafts. And in the contest the monkeys and Rākshasas emitted leonine roars. And monkeys crushed Yatudhānas with rocks, and, wrought with rage, (they) in the encounter slew (Rākshasas) covered with armour and ornaments; and some slew heroes mounted on cars and elephants and steeds. And the monkeys on a sudden slew heroic Yātudhānas. And smit with mountain-peaks on their persons, and with their eyes falling off, the foremost of Rākshasas moved, dropped down, or roared in the scene of conflict. And the Rākshasas (on their part) pierced the foremost of monkeys with sharpened and keen darts and clubs and scimitars; and slew them with darts and prācas. And, eager for bringing down each other, the monkeys and the Rākshasas with their persons, washed with the blood of their antagonists felled each other. And in a moment the earth was covered with crags and swords discharged by monkeys and Rākshasas,—and was drenched in gore. And the field was blocked up with scattered mountain-like Rakshas influenced by martial ardour,—mangled by their enemies. And the monkeys thrown down and felled by means of broken crags and monkeys243 and arms and legs,—waged a wonderful war. And those foremost of Nairitas slew monkeys with (the dead bodies of monkeys); and the monkeys smote Rākshasas with (the dead bodies of) Rākshasas; and the Rākshasas slew (the monkeys), hurling rocks and crags. And snatching away their own arms by main force, the monkeys finished Rakshas; and they slaughtered them with mountain-peaks, and also wounded each other. And the monkeys and Rākshasas emitted leonine roars in the encounter. And the Rākshasas, slain by the monkeys, having their mail and defence for the body rent, bled like unto trees exuding sap. And in that encounter, some among the monkeys destroyed cars with cars, elephants with elephants, and steeds with steeds. And the Rākshasas rived the trees and rocks of the foremost monkeys by means of Kshurapras and crescents and sharpened Bhallas and arrows. And in that encounter, the earth became impassable, having been scattered with crags baffled and severed trees and (warriors) slain by monkeys and Rakshas. And those monkeys, equipped with various weapons, and with their vigor unworn, entering upon the conflict casting off fear,—cheerfully putting forth efforts springing from pride of spirit, warred on with the Rākshasas. And in that fearful conflict, which was being waged, on the monkeys having been exhilarated and the Rākshasas having been brought down, the Maharshis and the deities sent up shouts. Then mounted on a charger endued with the celerity of the Wind, and grasping a whetted dart, Narāntaka entered into that fierce army of monkeys, like a fish diving into the deep. And that hero by means of an effulgent bearded dart pierced seven hundred monkeys; and at one time the high-souled enemy of Indra slew the army of the foremost of monkeys. And the Vidyādharas and Maharshis saw that high-souled one mounted on horseback, ranging the monkey-ranks. And his course was discovered, miry with flesh and blood and blocked up with mountain-like monkeys fallen. And when the monkeys set their hearts on displaying their prowess, Narāntaka, baffling them, pierced them with shafts. And he consumed the monkey-army, like fire burning a forest. And when the wood-rangers uprooted trees and crags, they slain by bearded darts dropped down like mountains riven by the thunder. And raising a glowing prāça, the powerful Narantaka began to range about in the rear244 of the forces; dashing everywhere (against the foe) in fight, like the wind in the rainy season. And the heroes could not appear prominently, or keep their posts. And how could they then move freely? And that one endued with prowess pierced everyone, whether springing, or staying, or moving. And broken through by a single prāça, resembling the Reaper, and furnished with solar effulgence, the monkey-ranks began to roll on the earth. And the monkeys were ill fitted to bear the impetus of that prāça having the touch of thunder itself; and they raised a loud cry. And the appearances of those monkey-heroes falling were like mountains toppling, having their summits riven with the thunder-bolt. Those high-souled and powerful monkeys that formerly had been brought down by Kumbhakarna,—having recovered, were present with Sugriva in this encounter. And Sugriva, looking around, saw that monkey-army flying in all directions, agitated with the fear of Narantaka. And after seeing the army in flight, he saw Narantaka himself, advancing, wielding a prāça, and mounted on a steed. And as soon as he saw (that hero), the exceedingly energetic lord of monkeys—Sugriva—addressed the heroic prince Angada, endowed with strength equal to that of Indra, saying,—\"Go against this heroic Rākshasas that is mounted on a steed; and speedily deprive of life that one who is devouring up the ranks of his foes\". Hearing his master's speech, Angada descended from that host resembling clouds, like the powerful Sun himself. And resembling a mass of crags, Angada—foremost of monkeys—adorned with Angadas, appeared beautiful like a mountain with metals on it. And weaponless himself, and furnished only with nails and teeth, Vāli's son attacking Narantaka, said,—\"Stay! What shalt thou do with these interior monkeys? This prāça, having the feel of the thunder-bolt, do thou hurl at my heart itself\". Hearing Angada's words, Narantaka was fired with wrath. And knawing his upper lip with his teeth and sighing like a serpent, Narāntaka, wrought with wrath, approached Vāli's son. And then whirling his prāça, he suddenly discharged that flaming (weapon) against Angada. And then it was snapped on the breast of Vāli's son, resembling the thunder-bolt, and dropped to the earth. And seeing the prāça broken in pieces, like a powerful snake severed by Suparna, Vāli's son, raising his hand, dealt a slap at the head of his (Narāntaka's) steed. Thereat, with his legs sinking down and his eye-balls coming off and his tongue hanging down, and wearing the look of a mountain,—on being smit with that slap, Narāntaka's steed fell down to the ground, with its head lying at random. And Narāntaka seeing his charger slain and fallen, was seized with a furious wrath, and raising his clenched fist, that one endowed with exceeding great energy in that conflict hit Vāli's son on the head. Thereat Angada having his head wounded by that blow, warm blood gushed out plentifully. And momentarily burning and momentarily swooning, he, regaining his senses, was amazed. Then Vāli's son, the high-souled Angada clenching his fist into a blow resembling Death itself in energy, and like unto a mountain-peak, let it descend on the chest of Narāntaka. Thereat, with his breast riven and broken down, vomitting flames and having his body bathed in blood, Narāntaka dropped down to the earth, like a hill shattered by the impetus of the thunder-bolt. And on Narāntaka of exceeding prowess having been slain by Vāli's son in battle, there arose a tremendous uproar in the firmament from the wood-rangers and the foremost of celestials. And Angada having performed that difficult deed of prowess, capable of delighting the mind of Rāma, was seized with amazement;245 and that one of terrific feats in fight was again inspired with delight in the encounter."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "And seeing Narāntaka slain, the foremost of Nairitas—including the three-headed Devāntaka and Pulastya's descendant, Mahodara,—began to cry (in chorus). And then the vehement Mahodara, mounted (on horseback), rushed against Vāli's son endued with energy. And aggrieved in consequence of the calamity that had befallen his brother, the strong Devāntaka grasping a dreadful bludgeon, darted against Angada. And ascending a car resembling the Sun yoked with superb steeds, the heroic Triçiras rushed against Vāli's son. Then charged by those three powerful Rākshasas—crushers of the hauteur of immortals, Angada uprooted a tree furnished with gigantic branches. And as Sakra hurleth the mighty flaming thunderbolt, that hero—Angada—at once hurled against Devāntaka that mighty tree having giant branches. And Triçiras cut off that tree in pieces by means of shafts resembling serpents. And seeing the tree severed, Angada darted up; and246 then that foremost of monkeys showered crags and trees. And all those Triçiras wrought with wrath cut off by means of whetted arrows; and Mahodara snapped those trees with the end of his bludgeon. And then Triçiras rushed against that hero—Vāli's son—with shafts; and Mahodara chased him,247 mounted on an elephant; and struck Angada in the chest with tomaras resembling the thunder-bolt. And Devāntaka, enraged advancing, hit Angada with his bludgeon, and then, endowed with velocity, he swiftly turned away. And attacked simultaneonly by those three powerful Nairitas, the exceedingly energetic son of Vāli possessed of prowess, did not feel any pain. And that impetuous one incapable of being conquered, summoning his utmost vehemence, rushing on, pealt a slap at his248 mighty elephant. And thereat the elephant fell down in his very sight and expired. And then pulling out his tusks, the highly powerful son of Vāli, darting against Devāntaka, dealt him a blow therewith in that encounter. And thereupon that strong one overwhelmed like a tree buffetted by the wind, began to discharge blood profusely, looking like the hue of lac. And then cheering him, the exceedingly energetic and powerful Narāntaka, violently whirling his bludgeon with might and main, hit Angada with it. And albeit struck with the bludgeon, the son of the lord of monkeys, going down on his knees, again darted up. And as he sprang up, Triçiras hit at the temples of the son of the king of monkeys with three straight-speeding terrific shafts. And seeing Angada assailed by the three redoubtable Rākshasas, Hanumān and Nila proceeded (to his rescue). Then Nila hurled a mountain-top at Triçiras; and thereat that son of Rāvana severed it with sharpened arrows. And that mountain-top on being riven, dropped down, aflame and shooting out sparks of fire. And seeing him249 yawning in joy, the stalwart Devāntaka in that encounter pursued the Wind-god's son with his bludgeon. And as he rushed on, that foremost of monkeys—Hanumān—dealt on the crown of his head, a blow resembling the thunder-bolt itself. And the mighty and heroic son of the Wind-god hit (at his antagonist); and that redoubted monkey also with his roars made the Rākshasas tremble (in fear). And thereat with his head crushed and cleft, and his teeth and eyes falling out, and his tongue hanging down, that son unto the sovereign of the Rākshasas suddenly dropped to the earth, deprived of life. On that fierce and mighty Rākshasa warrior—that foe of the immortals—having fallen in fight, the Three-headed one, waxing wondrous enraged began to shower terrific sharpened shafts on Nila's chest. And Mahodara, getting enraged, again swiftly mounted an elephant like the ray-furnished (Sun) mounting Mandara. Then even as a mass of roaring clouds poureth down showers enwheeled with levin on a mountain, he showered arrows right on Nila's breast. Thereat showered with those shafts, that leader of monkeys Nila with his person pierced, had his body riven and was stupified by that exceedingly powerful one. Then that (monkey) possessed of tremendous vehemence, having regained his senses, uprooting a crag with a whole tract of trees, struck it at Mahodara's head. And struck by that mighty enemy, Mahodara, broken down by the impetus of that rock, deprived of his senses, dropped down dead on the ground, like a cliff smit with the thunder-bolt."

 {
  "Yuddhakāndam": "Seeing his uncle slain, Triçiras took up his bow; and inflamed with fury pierced Hanumān with whetted arrows. And thereat the Wind-god's son, enraged, hurled a mountain-peak (at his adversary). And Triçiras by means of keen arrows severed the same in shivers. And seeing the mountain-peak baffled, the monkey in the encounter began to shower trees on Rāvana's son. And Triçiras endowed with prowess by means of sharpened shafts cut off that descending arrowy shower in the sky and shouted (in delight). Then Hanumān flying into a fury, bounding to the welkin, with his nails ripped the steed of Triçiras, even as a lion cleaveth a powerful elephant. Then taking a dart even as the Destroyer employeth the Fatal Night, Rāvana's son—Triçiras—discharged it at the offspring of the Wind-god. Thereat catching the dart of resistless course as it descended from the sky, the powerful monkey snapped it and then shouted. And seeing that dreadful dart broken by Hanumān, the monkeys, transported with delight, sent up shouts, even as clouds rumble. Than upraising his sword, that foremost of Rākshasas—Triçiras—brought it down on the breast of the monkey-chief. Overpowered with the sword-blow, Hanumān—son unto the Wind-god,—endowed with energy, dealt the Three-headed one a slap on the head. And smitten with that slap, the highly powerful Triçiras, with his hands and attire dropping off, fell down to the earth, deprived of consciousness. Then that mighty monkey resembling a hill broke his sword as he fell, and roared, terrifying all the Rākshasas. But not brooking that uproar, that night-ranger sprang up; and springing up, he dealt a blow at Hanumān. And at that blow, the redoubtable monkey was wrought up with wrath; and inflamed with rage, he smote that foremost of Rākshasas about his diadem. And then with a sharp sword the Wind-god's son cut off his heads decked with diadems and furnished with ear-rings; even as Sakra had severed the heads of Tashtri's son.250 Thereat even as burning stars, loosened, drop down from the course of Indra, the large organs of sense, and eyes flaming like glowing fire, and heads of that foe of Indra, dropped down to the ground. On Triçiras—enemy of the immortals—having been slain by Hanumān endowed with the prowess itself of Sakra, the monkeys shouted, the earth shook, and the Rakshas began to fly on all sides. And seeing Triçiras and Yudhyonmatta slain and seeing also the irrepressible Devāntaka and Narāntaka slain (in the encounter), that highly irascible and powerful Rākshasa—Matta—was transported with passion, and then took up a flaming mace entirely wrought with iron inlaid with gold; frothy with flesh and gore; mighty to behold; gratified with the blood of foes; with its end flaming in splendour; decked with red wreaths; and capable of striking terror into Airāvata and Mahāpadma and Sārvabhauma.251 And flaming up like the Fire arisen at the end of a Yuga, that foremost of Rākshasas—Matta—wrought with fury,—rushed against the monkeys. Then the mighty and powerful monkey—Rishabha—springing up before Rāvana's son, stood before the hosts of Matta. And seeing that mountain-like monkey staying before (him), Matta, enraged, dealt him a blow on the breast. And smit with the mace, that foremost of monkeys, with his breast riven and trembling, began to bleed copiously. And regaining his senses after a long while, Rishabha—lord of monkeys—inflamed with wrath, pouting out his upper lip, gazed at Mahāpārçwa.252 And then impetuously approaching the Rākshasa, that foremost of heroic monkeys resembling a hill, endowed with vehemence, clenching his fist, suddenly smote him with a blow on his breast. Thereat like a tree whose roots have been severed, he suddenly dropped on the ground, covered with blood. And thereupon, (Rishabha) swiftly snatched his dreadful mace resembling the rod of Yama himself; and shouted. Only for a moment did he253 remain like one dead. Recovering his senses, the enemy of the immortals, looking like evening clouds in hue, suddenly springing up, attacked the son of the king of waters.254 And thereat, he dropped down to the earth, senseless. In a moment regaining his consciousness, he again bounded up,—and whirling the mace resembling a peak of the foremost of mountains, in that encounter dealt (Matta) a blow therewith. And descending on the body of that dreadful one—the enemy of deities, sacrifices and Vipras—that terrific mace rived his breast; and he began to bleed profusely, even as the lord of mountains discharges minerals and water. And taking the terrific mace of the high-souled (Matta) and swinging it again and again, (Rishabha) rushed (against the Rākshasas). And that high-souled one began to slaughter Matta's forces in the field. And broken down by his own mace, Matta dropped down like a hill, with his teeth and eyes shrivelled up; and he dropped to the earth deprived of strength and life, with his eyes paling. And on that Rākshasa falling, the Rākshasa forces began to fly. And on that brother of Rāvana having been slain, that host of Nairitas appearing like the ocean in grandeur, leaving its arms behind,—solely for life rushed away, like unto the deep riven (by the winds)."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Seeing in sore straits his own mighty forces capable of making people's down stand on end,—and seeing his brothers resembling Sakra in prowess, routed; and seeing also his uncles brought down in battle, as well as his brothers—Yudhyonmatta and Matta—foremost of Rākshasas, that crusher of the pride of deities and Dānavas—the exceedingly energetic Atikāya—resembling a hill, who had obtained from Brahmā a boon in battle, was fired with wrath. Ascending a car effulgent like a thousand suns mingling their rays into a burst of brilliance, that enemy of Sakra, charged the monkeys. And stretching his bow, (Atikāya) decked with a diadem and wearing polished ear-rings, proclaimed his name (among the monkey-ranks) and shouted in lofty tones. And with his leonine roars and the proclamation of his name, and the tremendous twang of his bow-string, he struck terror into the monkeys. Seeing the magnitude of his person, the monkeys thinking that it was Kumbhakarna who had come,—and affrighted thereat, sought the shelter of each other. And seeing his form like unto that of Vishnu when he displayed his threefold energy, the monkey-warriors seized with fear, began to scour on all sides. And on Atikāya appearing before them, the monkeys, stupified in that conflict, saught the shelter of Lakshmana's elder brother. And from a distance Kākutstha saw the mountain like Atikāya mounted on the car and equipped with his bow, like unto roaring clouds (seen) on the occasion of the universal disruption. And seeing that huge-bodied one, Rāghava struck with surprise, comforting the monkeys, addressed Bibhishana, saying,—\"Who is this one resembling a mountain, furnished with a bow and having leonine eyes, that is stationed on a large car yoked with a thousand steeds,—he that with effulgent sharpened darts and keen prāças and tomaras, shineth like Maheçwara environed by spectres—he that displaying his fatal tongue, appeareth splendid, surrounded with darts in his car; like a mass of clouds graced with lightning. And his bows adorned and backed with gold all over, beautify his car even as Indra's bow beautifyeth the firmament. And who is this foremost of Rākshasas and best of bowmen that embellishing the field of battle, approacheth on a car glorious as the sun; who, displaying the ten cardinal points with his shafts resembling the rays of the sun, appeareth handsome with his peak of a banner bearing the figure of Rāhu—whose bow bent in three places, emitting roars resembling the rumbling of clouds, and plated with gold, looketh like the bow itself of Satakratu? And his mighty car furnished with a banner and ensign and bottom, and having clatter resembling the roaring of clouds, hath four horsemen (attached to it). And there are on the car eight and thirty quivers and dreadful bows and yellow-golden bow-strings. And there are (in that car) two effulgent swords at his side, illumining it,—their hafts measuring four hands and their blades ten each. And that calm (warrior) wears red garlands about his neck, and resembles a mighty mountain. And a very Destroyer, he hath a mighty mouth, appearing like that of the Destroyer himself; and he looketh like the sun stationed on clouds. And with his arms adorned with golden angadas, he appeareth splendid like that best of mountains—the Himavān with its towering summits. And with his pair of ear-rings, his charming yet terrific countenance shineth like the full Moon entering into Punarvaçu.255 O mighty-armed one, tell me all about this foremost of Rākshasas, seeing whom the monkeys, overwhelmed with fear, fly away in all directions\". Asked by the king's son—Rāma of immeasurable prowess—the exceedingly energetic Bibhishana spoke unto Rāma, informing him,—\"The highly powerful king, Vaisravana's younger brother of dreadful deeds, the high-souled Rāvana—is the sovereign of the Rākshasas. This one is his mighty son, like unto Rāvana himself in strength. He serveth the aged, is of wide celebrity and is the prime of those versed in all branches of knowledge. And he is competent to ride horses and elephants, to wield the sword or draw the bow,—or in sowing dissensions, or giving away, or in counsel,—he reposing in whose arm Lankā hath cast off fear. Know him to be Atikāya, son unto Dhānyamāli. Having adored the pure-souled Brahmā with austerities, he hath obtained weapons, and hath defeated his foes (in fight)\". 'Thou shalt be incapable of being slain by celestials and Asuras'—was the boon conferred on him by the Self-sprung; and he also gave him this celestial mail and this car resembling the effulgent Sun himself. He hath vanquished (in battle) hundreds of deities and Dānavas; and he hath (always) protected the Rakshas, and destroyed Yakshas. And this intelligent one resisted the thunder-bolt itself of Indra; and in encounter baffled the very noose of the king of waters. This one is Atikāya—foremost of Rākshasas; and that son of Rāvana is the humbler of the hauteur of deities and Dānavas. Therefore, O best of persons, do thou endeavour thy best. This one with his shafts slaughtered the monkey-hosts before (us)\". And then the powerful Atikāya entering that monkey-force, stretched his bow and shouted again and again. And the high-souled principal monkeys, seeing that (hero) possessed of a dreadful person, that best of car-warriors—stationed on his car, rushed forward. And Kumuda and Dwivida and Mainda and Nila and Sabha dashed on at one time with trees and mountain-peaks. Thereupon that foremost of those skilled in weapons, the exceedingly energetic Atikāya, severed those trees and rocks by means of shafts dight with gold. And in that encounter that powerful one possessed of a gigantic person, skilled in arms, pierced all those monkeys staying before him with arrows entirely made of iron. And agonised, having their persons pierced in that mighty conflict by that arrowy shower, they were incapable of resisting the same. And the Rākshasa terrified that host of monkey-heroes, even as an enraged lion priding in his youth terrifyeth a society of deer. And in the midst of those bands of monkeys, that lord of Rākshasas did not slay anyone without battle. And then springing up before Rāma, that one furnished with his bow and quiver, addressed him in haughty words, saying,—\"Stationed in this car holding the bow and arrows in my hands, I will not fight any that is ignoble. Him that hath strength, and that also understandeth this business,—let him today speedily give me battle\". Hearing his speech, that slayer of foes—Sumitrā's son—was fired with wrath. And not bearing him, he sprang forward disregarding his antagonist's words, and took up his bow. And flying unto fury, Sumitrā's son, darting up, took out arrows from his quiver, and stretched his mighty bow in front of Atikāya. And filling the entire earth and the sky and the ocean and all the cardinal quarters,—the terrific twang of Lakshmana's bow struck terror into the (hearts of the) night-rangers. And hearing the dreadful twang of the bow of Sumitrā's son, the exceedingly energetic and powerful son of the lord of Rākshasas was struck with surprise. Then Atikāya, enraged, seeing Lakshmana advance, taking sharpened shafts, spoke unto him,—\"Thou art a boy, O Sumitrā's son; and as such knowest not how to display prowess. Go thou. Why wishest thou to fight with me resembling Death itself. Not Himālaya itself or the firmament or the earth is capable of bearing the impetuosity of shafts shot by my arms. Thou wishest to rouse a fire slumbering sweetly. Leaving alone thy bow, do thou return. Do not lose thy life by coming in contact with me. Or it may be that thou art proud; and, therefore, hast no mind to return. Stay then. Renouncing thy life, thou shalt go to Yama's mansion. Behold my whetted arrows—crushers of the insolence of foes—resembling the weapon itself of the Lord,256—adorned with burnished gold. And even as a lion enraged sheddeth the blood of a mighty elephant, this arrow of mine resembling a serpent shall shed thy blood\". Having delivered himself thus, he fired with wrath set his shaft on his bow. Hearing in that encounter Atikāya's wrathful speech fraught with hauteur, the highly powerful and intelligent son of the king possessed of exceeding grace, was transported with passion; and he said,—\"Thou canst not attain pre-eminence solely by virtue of thy speech. One cannot be a worthy person simply by say. O wicked-minded one, do thou display thy strength on me equipped with the bow and holding arrows in my hands. To-day shall my shafts decked in gold, drink thy blood flowing from thy person and issuing out of wounds inflicted by my arrows resembling darts.—'This one is a boy', thinking this, thou ought not to slight me. Whether I am a boy or an old257 man—death shalt thou know in the conflict. It was as a boy that Vishnu had overpowered the triune world with his prowess\". Hearing Lakshmana's words, fraught with reason and high sense, Vidyādharas and ghosts, deities, Daityas and Maharshis, and the high-souled Guhyakas then beheld that marvel.258"

 {
  "Yuddhakāndam": "Then Atikāya, enraged, setting his arrow on his bow, shot it at Lakshmana, as if devouring up the welkin. Thereat, Lakshmana—slayer of hostile heroes—with a crescent severed that sharpened shaft resembling a venomous serpent, as it was descending. And seeing the shaft severed, like a serpent having its person cut off, Atikāya waxing exceedingly enraged, took up five arrows; and the night-ranger discharged them at Lakshmana. Thereat Bharata's younger brother cut off the approaching arrows with whetted shafts. And having severed them with sharpened shafts, Lakshmana—slayer of hostile heroes—took up a sharpened arrow, as if flaming in energy. And taking it, Lakshmana set it on his excellent bow; and drawing the latter, vigorously discharged the shaft. And that hero endowed with prowess hit that foremost of Rākshasas in the forehead with that shaft having bent knots, discharged from his bow drawn to its full bent.—And that arrow piercing the forehead of that dreadful Rākshasa, and smeared with blood, appeared like the lord of serpents in a mountain. And the Rākshasa, smarting under Lakshmana's shaft, showered, like the dreadful gateway of Tripuri battered by Rudra. Then recovering himself and reflecting, he said,259—\"Excellent well! By this discharge of thy shaft, thou approvest thyself as a foe in whom I can well glory\". Having spoken thus candidly, he, folding his hands at ease, and seated on the platform of his car, began to range in it. And then that foremost of Rākshasas began to take up, set, and shoot one, three, five, or seven shafts. And those shafts resembling Fate itself, plated with gold at the feathered parts,—and looking like the Sun himself (in splendour),—discharged from the bow of the lord of Rākshasas, lighted up the heavens. Thereat Rāghava's younger brother by means of many a sharpened shaft calmly cut off all those vollies of arrows shot by the Rākshasa. And finding all those arrows riven in the encounter, that enemy of the lord of the immortals, Rāvana's son, was fired with wrath, and took up a whetted shaft. And then aiming that arrow, that highly powerful one suddenly shot it; and with that, rushing on, hit Sumitrā's son in the chest. And struck in the encounter by Atikāya, the son of Sumitrā began to bleed copiously, like a mad elephant discharging the temporal juice. And then that lord at once extricated the arrow; and then took up a keen shaft and fixed the same on his weapon.260 And then he set a shaft (on his bow-string) reciting a formula for the Agneya261 weapon; and thereat his arrow as well as bow flamed up. Then the highly powerful Atikāya took up a Raudra262 weapon; and thereon fixed a shaft plated with gold at the feathered part, and resembling a serpent in sheen. And even as the Reaper hurleth his rod, did Lakshmana hurl that weapon inspired with divine energy, dreadful and aflame,—at Atikāya. And seeing that shaft set upon an Agneya weapon, that night-ranger discharged a Raudra arrow set upon a Solar weapon. And there like a pair of infuriated serpents, those arrows with their heads flaming in energy, baffled each other in the sky. And burning each other, the shafts fell on the earth; and those best of arrows, shorn of brilliance and reduced to ashes, were deprived of their splendour. And having blazed in the welkin, those two fell down to the earth reft of their lustre, Then Atikāya wrought up with wrath discharged an arrow called Aishika dedicated to Tashtri. Thereat the powerful son of Sumitrā severed that shaft by an Aindra263 weapon. Seeing Aishika baffled, that Prince—son unto Rāvana—fired with rage, fixed an arrow on a Yamya264 weapon; and then the night-ranger shot that weapon at Lakshmana. And Lakshmana resisted it by a Vāyavya265 weapon. And then as a mass of clouds poureth down showers, Lakshmana, enraged, poured volleys of shafts on Rāvana's son. Thereupon, hitting Atikāya, those arrows coming in contact with his mail, had their barbs broken, and fell down to the earth. And seeing them baffled, that slayer of hostile heroes—the renowned Lakshmana—began to shower shafts by thousands. And albeit showered with those arrows, that Rākshasa—the mighty Atikāya—in that encounter was not pierced by them on account of his impenetrable mail; and that best of men failed to hurt him in the contest. Then approaching him, the Wind-god spake unto him, saying,—\"This one hath received a boon from Brahmā, and is covered with an impenetrable mail. Pierce him with a Brāhma266 weapon. He cannot otherwise be slain. This one clad in mail and endowed with prowess is forsooth incapable of being slain by others\". Hearing the words of the Wind-god, Sumitrā's son like unto Indra in prowess took an arrow endowed with fierce impetuosity, and at once set it on a Brāhma weapon. And on that sharp-headed best of arrows being fixed on that foremost of weapons, the cardinal quarters and the Moon and the Sun and the mighty planets and the sky were seized with affright; and the earth shook. And inspiring that arrow furnished with a feathered part and resembling an emissary of Yama himself, and fixing the same an his bow, Sumitrā's son in that encounter discharged that shaft like unto the thunder-bolt at the son of the enemy of Indra. And in that conflict Atikāya beheld that shaft fair-feathered and having its feathered part dight with splendid diamonds, acquiring enhanced vehemence arising from its having been discharged by Lakshmana,—and hissing and rushing on with tremendous impetuosity. And seeing it, Atikāya swiftly resisted it with countless sharpened shafts. But endowed with the energy of Suparna himself, that shaft vehemently went to him. And seeing that shaft flaming and resembling the Fatal Destroyer himself,—coming, he, exerting himself to the utmost resisted it with darts and rishtis and maces and adzes and javelins and arrows. But beating down all those weapons of wonderful forms, that arrow alive with flames, coming to the diadem-decked head of Atikāya, severed the same (in twain) And that head furnished with a corsalet, cut off by Lakshmana's arrow, suddenly dropped to the earth, like a summit of Himavān toppling (to the ground). Seeing him rolling on the earth, with his attire and ornaments scattered about, those night-rangers that survived were overwhelmed with grief. And with pale forces and distressed, they, fatigued in consequence of the thrashing they had undergone, suddenly began to cry in frightful accents. And on their leader having been slain, those night-rangers that were about (Atikāya), without waiting any longer,—overwhelmed with panic, rushed towards the city. And on their foe endowed with terrific prowess and incapable of being confronted, having been slain, innumerable monkeys filled with excess of joy, and displaying countenances resembling blown lotuses, paid homage unto Lakshmana working out their welfare."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Hearing Atikāya slain by the high-souled Lakshmana, the king was filled with exceeding great anxiety and spoke thus,—\"Dhumrāksha exceedingly wrathful,—best of those equipped with all arms—and Akampana and Prahasta and Kumbhakarna—all these exceedingly mighty heroes—Rākshasas ever seeking warfare, conquerers of the forces of foes, and never defeated by antagonists, have together with their hosts been slain by Rāma of untiring feats. And other Rākshasas having gigantic bodies and skilled in various arms,—countless high-souled heroes—have also been brought down. These brothers were formerly bound by my son Indrajit of renowned strength and prowess with terrific shafts, obtained as boons. And I do not know by what power or superhuman virtue or stupifying energy did those brothers—Rāma and Lakshmana—liberate themselves from those dreadful bonds, which could be loosed neither by celestials nor the highly powerful Asuras combined nor Yakyas, Gandharbas and Pannagas. And all those heroic Rākshasa warriors that marched forth at my bidding, have been destroyed by monkeys of marvellous might. Him see I not that can now slay Rāma with Lakshmana,—that hero together with his forces and Sugriva and Bibhishana. Alack! mighty must be Rāma and wondrous is his strength of weapon—he coming in contact with whose prowess, these Rākshasas have met with their deaths. Now let this palace be everywhere guarded by a vigilant garrison,—as also the açoka wood where Sitā is being guarded. We should always be acquainted with the ingress and egress (of every person). And do ye, surrounded by forces, remain where there are garrisons. And the night-rangers should in the evening, at midnight and in the morning always watch the movements of the monkeys. The monkeys should by no means be slighted. And ye should know whether the enemy putteth forth (fresh) efforts,—and whether they advance or remain stationed where they at present are\".—Thereupon those exceeding mighty Rākshasas did as they had been desired. And having directed them, Rāvana—lord of Rākshasas—bearing the dart of ire (in his heart), in forlorn guise entered his own mansion. And with the fire of his rage blazing up, the exceedingly powerful sovereign of the night-rangers, absorbed with the danger that had befallen his son, began to sigh momentarily."

 {
  "Yuddhakāndam": "Those Rakshas that remained after the others had been slain, swiftly informed Rāvana that all those foremost of Rākshasas—Devāntaka and the rest, Triçiras, Atikāya and others—had been slain. And suddenly hearing them slain, the king with his eyes charged with brine, thinking of the disastrous destruction of his sons and brothers, was extremely agonized. Thereupon, seeing the king afflicted, and sunk in a sea of sorrow, that foremost of car-warriors—son unto the Rākshasa king—Indrajit, addressed (his sire), saying,—\"O father, it doth not behove thee to be overcome with this excessive grief, inasmuch as, O lord of Nairitas, Indrajit yet breaths. Smit by the enemy of Indra, (Rāghava) can by no means save his life in encounter. To-day behold Rāma along with Lakshmana with their bodies torn with my shafts,—lying down lifeless on the ground, having their persons covered with my sharpened arrows! Hear this vow of the foe of Indra, never swerving and instinct with prowess and divinity,—this very day will I with unfailing shafts slay Rāma along with Lakshmana. To-day let Indra and Vaivaçwata and Vishnu and Rudra and Sādhyas and Vaiçwas and men and the Sun and the Moon, behold my immeasurable prowess, terrific like that of Vishnu at the sacrificial ground of Vāli\". Having spoken thus, that foe of the lord of celestials endowed with exceeding energy, taking the king's permission, ascended a car having the velocity of the wind itself, yoked with asses, and furnished with every variety of weapons. And ascending the car, resembling the car of Hari himself, that exceedingly powerful repressor of enemies at once set out for the field of battle. And as that high-souled (hero) marched, he was followed by countless mighty (Rākshasas) breathing spirits; bearing bows in their strong hands. And some of those, resembling mountains, were mounted on elephants, and some on superb steeds, and some on bears, and some on beasts of prey, and some on lions and jackals,—and some of the Rākshasas endowed with dreadful vigor were mounted on crows, and some on swans, and some on peacocks,—they were equipped with prāças and maces and nistrinças and axes and clubs. And all sides were filled with the blares of conchs and the sounds of kettle-drums. And then that enemy of the lord of celestials marched forth with impetuosity. And with an umbrella hued like the Moon, that destroyer of enemies appeared like the full Moon stationed in the sky. And that hero garnished in golden ornaments—that foremost of all bowmen—was fanned by an excellent and graceful golden chowri. And with Indrajit furnished with the splendour of the Sun himself, and possessed of peerless prowess, Lankā, looked beauteous even as the firmament graced with the glorious Sun."

 {
  "Yuddhakāndam": "Arriving at the scene of conflict, that highly powerful repressor of foes arrayed his forces around the car. And then that foremost of Rākshasas with choice mantras duly offered libations unto Fire.267 And that powerful lord of Rākshasas there worshipping Fire with fragrant wreaths and fried paddy, sacrificed unto it. And arms served for Kāça and Bibhitakas for fuel; and there were red cloths and a ladle made of black iron. And spreading Fire there, with tomaras representing Kāça, he seized the neck of a living goat. And then the kindled smokeless fire blazing up brilliantly, displayed signs betokening victory. Thereat, with his right tongue whirling, the Deity of Fire himself looking like one made of gold,—arising, accepted the offering. And then that (Rākshasa) skilled in weapons acquired a Brāhma weapon (from that Deity), and inspired his bow and car with mantras. On that weapon having been invoked,268 and on (the god of Fire) also having been worshipped, the firmament furnished with the suns and stars and planets was afflicted with affright. Having worshipped (the god of Fire), that one endowed with the splendour of Fire itself, that one possessed of the prowess of the great Indra and gifted with inconceivable vigor, accoutred in bows and arrows and swords and having steeds and cars and darts,—disappeared in the sky. Then burning for battle, setting up roars went out the Rākshasa ranks, thronging with steeds and cars, and graced with pennons and standards. And they fell to slaughtering monkeys in the engagement with countless shafts, sharp, variegated and decorated; as also with tomaras and hooks. And Rāvana's son, fired with wrath, seeing those night-rangers, addressed them, saying,—\"Do ye, burning with a desire to destroy the monkeys, fight cheerfully\". Thereat all those Rākshasas, eager for victory, smitting roars, covered the dreadful monkeys with showers of shafts. And environed by Rakshas in that encounter, he269 poured on the monkeys nālikas and narāchas and maces and clubs. And trembling in the encounter, those monkeys armed with trees at once began to shower rocks and trees on Rāvana's son. Then the exceedingly powerful Indrajit, son unto Rāvana, endowed with wondrous energy, pierced the bodies of the monkeys (with arrows). And fired with wrath, that (hero) rejoicing the Rākshasas with a single shaft pierced nine and seven monkeys in that encounter. And that invincible hero in that conflict mangled the monkeys with shafts resembling the Sun, decked with gold. And their persons pierced in that contest, and themselves pained with those arrows, they began to fall down, giving up all intention of fight, like mighty Asuras smit by the celestials. And then waxing highly enraged, those considerable monkeys in that conflict hotly pursued (Indrajit) resembling the Sun himself and having terrific arrows for his rays. And all the monkeys, with their bodies riven and deprived of their senses, and bathed in blood and writhing in torments,—pursued (Indrajit). And putting forth their prowess in behalf of Rāma, those monkeys, equipped with rocks in the encounter, who had set apart their very lives (for him), paused, shouting up loudly. And they in that conflict showered trees and crags and mountain-tops on Rāvana's son. And that destroyer of foes—the exceedingly energetic son unto Rāvana—resisted that mighty shower of trees and stones capable of compassing destruction. Then that Lord pierced the monkey-hosts in the encounter with shafts resembling fire or venomous serpents. And piercing Gandhamādana with eight and ten sharp arrows, he wounded Nila stationed at a distance with nine shafts. And that one endowed with redoubtable prowess pierced Mainda with seven shafts capable of piercing into the pith; and he pierced Gaja with five shafts in the encounter. And he pierced Jāmbavān with ten and Nila with thirty. And then with dreadful sharp shafts obtained as boons, he rendered Sugriva and Rishabha and Angada and Dwivida (almost) lifeless. And transported with passion, and resembling the Five arisen at Doomsday, Indrajit, harassed other principal monkeys with countless arrows. And in that terrific conflict, he agitated the monkey-hosts with swift-speeding shafts, resembling the Sun himself, deftly discharged (from his bow). Then in that encounter, leaving his army, Indrajit became suddenly invisible unto the monkey-hosts,—and began to shower fierce arrows, like dark clouds pouring rain. And with their persons torn by the arrows of the conqueror of Sakra,—slain by his power of illusion,—with their teeth uprooted, those mountain-like monkeys fell down in the field, emitting frightful cries,—like a mountain smit with Indra's thunderbolt. And in the conflict they could only see sharp pointed shafts among the monkey-ranks; but that foe of the celestial chief—the Rākshasa, hidden by virtue of illusion, they could not discover there. And then the high-souled lord of Rakshas covered all sides with sharp-pointed shafts resembling the rays of the Sun; and he rived the foremost monkeys. And whirling darts and nistraiças and axes, flaming and having the effulgence of Fire,—and furnished with flames shooting forth sparks,—he discharged them furiously at the forces of the sovereign of monkeys. And the monkey-leaders struck with Sakrajit's shafts resembling flames, appeared like laughing Kinçukas. And some looking at the sky were struck at their eyes. And they gradually began to hide themselves in each other and drop to the earth. And that foremost of Rākshasas—Indrajit—with prāças and darts and whetted arrows, inspired with mantras, pierced all those powerful monkeys,—Hanumān and Sugriva and Angada and Gandhamādana and Jāmbavān and Sushena and Vegadarçin, and Mainda and Dwivida and Nila and Gavāksha and Gavaya and Kesari and Hariloman and the monkey Vidyutdanshtra and Suryyānana and Jyotimukha and the monkey Dadhimukha and Pāvakāksha and Nala and the monkey Kumuda. And having pierced those foremost monkeys with golden-hued maces, he showered on Rāma and Lakshmana arrows resembling the rays of the Sun. And showered with those vollies of arrows, Rāma, without heeding that discharge resembling a very downpour,—reflecting, spoke unto Lakshmana,—\"O Lakshmana, this lord of Rākshasas, this foe of the lord of celestials, having obtained the Brāhma weapon,—after having brought down the monkey-hosts, are assailing us with sharpened shafts. And that high-souled heedful one, having been given a boon by the Self-sprung, hath rendered his dreadful body invisible. How can we slay him, who is fighting with upraised weapons, but who hath hid his body. The reverend Self-sprung, I deem, is incomprehensible. And this is his weapon, embodying his energy. Therefore, O intelligent one, do thou to-day along with me calmly bear this. And let this foremost them all—this lord of Rākshasas—cover all sides with the showers of his shafts. And in consequence of this, the army of the monkey-king with its greatest heroes fallen, doth not appear to advantage. And seeing us also fallen senseless, and desisting from fight with our joy and anger gone off from us, for certain will the enemy of the immortals, taking the Fortune of fight seek his home\". And assailed by Indra with networks of arrows, they were then sore distressed the field. And having struck them with sadness, Indra from joy shouted in the encounter. And having thus worst in battle that monkey-army and Rāma along with Lakshmana he speedily entered the city ruled by the hand of the Ten-necked one. And extolled by the Yatudhānas, he, filled with delight, related everything unto his sire."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "And they270 were rendered inert in the field; and the army of the monkey-leaders was stupified, with Sugriva and Nila and Angada and Jāmbavān,—and they did not show any signs of activity. Thereupon, seeing them dispirited, that foremost of intelligent persons—Bibhishana—cheering them up with his peerless speech, said,—\"Ye heroes of the king of monkeys, do not give way to fear. This is not the time to indulge in grief at this place; for the sons of the noble one,271—inactive and depressed, and seeming to be wounded with the showers of Indrajit's shafts,—are in reality in this plight, for showing reverence unto the words272 of the Self-sprung one.—On him the Self-sprung hath conferred the mighty Brahmā, weapon of unfailing power; and the king's sons are doing honour to it by lying down on the field of battle. Why then do ye grieve now?\" Hearing the words of Bibhishana and honoring the Brahmā weapon, Hanumān spoke as follows:—\"The host of the quick-paced monkeys hath been slain by this weapon. Let us go and console them who are still living\". And those two great heroes—Hanumān and that foremost of the Rākshasas, with fire-brands in their hands, began to range to and fro in the battle field. And they beheld there the earth strewn on all sides with monkeys lying down like so many hills and various shining weapons. And some of these monkeys were deprived of their tails, some of their hands, some of their thighs, some of their legs, some of their fingers, and some of their heads. And blood was gushing out from the persons of some, and others were urinating out of fear. And Bibhishana and Hanumān beheld there Sugriva, Angada, Nila, Gandhamldana, Jāmbavān, Sushena, Vegadarshin, Mainda, Nala, Jyotimukha, and the monkey, Dwivida,—almost slain. And Bibhishana and Hanumān saw in the field seven and sixty kotis of fleet-footing monkeys slain (in battle) at the fifth part of the day by the darling of the Self-sprung. And surveying that host worsted, dreadful like the surges of the sea, Hanumān and Bibhishana began to search for Jāmbavān. And finding that heroic son of Prajāpati, afflicted with natural decrepitude, aged, and resembling smouldering fire,—wounded with hundreds of shafts, Pulastya's son said,—\"O noble one, hath not thy life been destroyed with those sharp shafts?\" Hearing Bibhishana's words, Jāmbavān—best of bears—evoking utterance with extreme effort, said,—\"O foremost of Nairitas, endowed with exceeding prowess, I know thee by thy voice. Having my person pierced with sharp shafts, I cannot see thee with my eyes. Doth he through whom Anjanā as well as Mātariçwa273 are blessed with fair offspring,—doth that prince of monkeys—Hanumān—live?\" Hearing Jāmbavān's speech, Bibhishaua said,—\"Why, passing by the son of the high and mighty,274 dost thou enquire after the Wind-god's offspring? O noble one, thou dost not show that overflowing affection either for king Sugriva or Rāghava that thou showest for the son of the Wind-god\". Hearing Bibhishana's words, Jāmbavān said,—\"Hear, O foremost of Rākshasas, why I enquire after the Wind-god's son. While this hero is alive, this force, albeit destroyed, liveth; but if Hanumān is reft of life, although living, we are destroyed. O child, if the Wind-god's offspring, resembling his sire himself or (the deity of) Fire in prowess, is alive, there is hope for our lives\". Then approaching that aged one, Hanumān—son unto the Wind god—saluted him humbly, holding Jāmbavān's feet. Hearing Hanumān's voice, that foremost of monkeys, with his senses sorely smarting, deemed himself as having regained his life. Then that exceedingly energetic one addressed Hanumān, saying,—\"Come, O powerful monkey. It behoveth thee to rescue the monkeys. There is none else. Endowed with profuse prowess, thou art the greatest friend of these. This is the hour when thou shouldst display thy might. Any other see I not. Do thou cheer up this host consisting of bears and monkeys; and do thou also heal the wounds of these two tormented by them. Bounding sheer over the main, thou, O Hanumān, shouldst repair to the Himavān—foremost of mountains. There thou wilt see that best of mountains—the golden Rishabha of terrific aspect, and, smiter of foes, the peak also of Kailāça. Lying in the Up of these two, thou, O hero, O powerful monkey, wilt see the mountain of medicines, fraught with healing herbs of all kinds. On its summit thou wilt find four medicinal herbs flaming and illumining the ten cardinal quarters—viz., Mritasanjivani,275 Viçalyakarani,276 Suvarnakarani,277 and the mighty medicine, Sandhāni. O Hanumān, providing thyself with these, thou shouldst come hither without delay. Do thou, O offspring of the Wind-god278 bringing back lives unto these monkeys, cheer them up\". Thereat Hanumān filled himself with energy, even as the Ocean heaveth with the force of the winds (blowing on its breast). And ascending the summit of that mountain,279 and hurting it with his tread, that hero—Hanumān—appeared like a second mountain, And crushed under the tread of that monkey, the mountain was dispirited; and sore distressed, it could hardly contain itself. And the trees on it began to topple to the earth; and on account of the vehemence of the monkey, they flamed up. And smitten by Hanumān, its peaks were scattered around. And monkeys could no longer dwell on that foremost of mountains, which, being hard pressed (by Hanumān), was trembling all over, with its slopes covered with broken trees and rocks. And with her giant gateways shaking, and the doors of her edifices broken, that night Lankā, overwhelmed with fright, seemed to be dancing. And the offspring of the Wind-god, resembling a mountain itself, bringing that mountain to sore straits, agitated the entire earth with her Oceans. And hurting the mountain with his tread, he, opening wide his mouth resembling that of a mare, sent up loud shouts, terrifying the night-rangers. And hearing those tremendous roars as he kept emitting cries, the powerful Rākshasas were quite stupified. And bowing down unto the Ocean, that subduer of enemies, the Wind-god's son, endowed with dreadful prowess, began to ponder over the mighty mission with which he had been entrusted in the interests of Rāghava.—And, then upraising his tail resembling a serpent, bending his back, contracting his ears, and opening his mouth looking like that of a mare, that one possessed of terrific impetuosity, bounded into the sky. And with the vehemence of his rush,—he carried away in his wake whole tracts of trees, and rocks, and crags, and inferior monkeys;280 and after having been carried away some distance by the vehemence of his arms and thighs, they, at length losing their velocity, fell into the waters (of the Ocean.) And stretching his arms resembling serpents, the son of the Wind-god endowed with the prowess of Gāruda281 coursed on towards the monarch of mountains, as if making all the quarters tremble. And seeing the sea with its hosts of billows rolling furiously, and with the confederacies of aquatic animals bewildered by the angry waters, he coursed on rapidly, like the discus discharged by the hand of Vishnu. And surveying hills and birds and pools and rivers and tanks and splendid cities and flourishing provinces, that one equal to his sire himself in celerity, held his way. And that hero—Hanumān—like unto his father in prowess, and incapable of being fatigued, vigorously proceeded along the orbit of the Sun. And that powerful monkey possessed of the speed of the Wind itself, and having mighty impetuosity, careered, making all sides resound with his roars. And remembering Jāmbavān's words, that redoubtable monkey, son unto the Wind-god, possessed of terrific prowess, and resembling a mountain, suddenly saw (before him) the Himavān: furnished with countless cascades and numerous caves and rivulets; with splendid summits appearing like massess of pale clouds; and graced with various trees. And arriving at that lord of mighty mountains, furnished with excellent towering golden summits, he saw the great sacred asylums (of the ascetics), inhabited by the flower of celestial saints. And he saw Brahmakoça282 and Rajatālaya283 and Sakrālaya284 and Rudraçarapramoksha285 and Hayānana286 and the flaming Brahmaçiras,287 and the servants of Vaivaçwata.288 And he saw the abode of the Fire-god, and the abode of Vaiçravana and the effulgent Suryyanivandhana.289 and the abode of Brahmā,290 and the bow of Sankara, and the navel of the Earth.291 And he saw Kailaça of terrific aspect, and the stone292 of Himavān, and that bull,293 and the golden mountain, and that foremost of mountains furnished with all medicinal herbs, flaming, and illuminated with every kind of medicinal plants. And beholding that flaming mass of fire, the offspring of Vāsava's294 emissary wondered. And bounding up to the lord of medicinal mountains, he fell to searching for the drugs. And that mighty monkey—the Wind-god's son—leaving behind a thousand yojanas, began to range the mountain containing the divine remedies in its entrails. And those potent medicines, in that foremost of mountains, knowing (before-hand) that one was coming seeking for them, rendered themselves invisible. And not seeing them, the high-souled Hanumān was angered; and from wrath he set up roars. And not brooking that, (Hanumān) with eyes resembling glowing fire, addressed that foremost of mountains, saying,—\"What is this that thou hast decided on, that thou showest no compassion for Rāghava? But, O lord of mountains, to-day witness thyself, overpowered by my arms and torn in pieces!\" And (anon) on a sudden, he violently rooted up its summit with trees and elephants and gold, and furnished with a thousand varieties of ore,—having its tops torn and its slopes aflame. And uprooting it, he sprang into (the bosom of the air), terrifying the worlds containing celestials and the lords thereof. And hymned by countless rangers of the air, that one endowed with the terrific impetuosity of Gāruda himself, taking that summit furnished with the splendour of the Sun, went along the orbit of the Sun. And near the Sun, that Sun-like one seemed to be another Sun. And with that mountain, the offspring of the bearer of perfumes appeared surpassingly grand, like very Vishnu equipped with the flaming discus having a thousand edges. And seeing him, the monkeys shouted,—and he also, seeing then, shouted in delight. And hearing their tremendous cheers, those residing in Lankā shouted still more dreadfully. And then the high-souled one dropped on that best of mountains in the midst of the monkey-forces; and, bowing down unto the principal monkeys there, he embraced Bibhishana. And then those sons of that king of men, smelling the perfume of that mighty medicine, were then and there healed of their wounds; and the heroic monkeys also sat up. And all the heroic monkeys were instantly healed and cured; and those also that were slain (in battle), through the smell of that best of drugs, sat up, like persons risen after sleep at break of day. Ever since the monkeys and Rākshasas had begun to fight, for maintaining honor, all those Rākshasas that were slain there by the mighty monkeys, were thrown into the sea. Then that monkey, the offspring of the bearer of fragrance, endowed with terrific speed, took that medicinal mountain (back) unto Himavān and again presented himself before Rāma."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Then the exceedingly energetic lord of monkeys, Sugriva, said unto Hanumān these words fraught with import,—\"Inasmuch as Kumbhakarna hath been slain as also the princes,295 Rāvana can no longer defend the city.296 Now let those principal monkeys that are endowed with great strength and that are furnished with fleetness, taking fire-brands (in their hands) rapidly rush towards Lankā\". Then when the Sun had set and at the terrific front of Night, those foremost of monkeys marched towards Lankā, equipped with fire-brands. And charged at all points by numbers of monkeys armed with fire-brands, those fierce-eyed (Rākshasas) that guarded the gates297 suddenly fled away. And thereat, (the monkeys) delighted set fire to gates and upper apartments and spacious high-ways and various by-ways and edifices. And the fire298 burnt their299 mansions by thousands; and mountain-like superstructures toppled headlong to the earth. And there burnt aguru, and sweet sandal, and pearls, and sheeny gems, and diamonds and corals. And there burnt linen and fine silk and āvikas and various kinds of woolen cloths; and vessels of gold, and weapons; divers kinds of furniture, trappings and ornaments of steeds; cords for tying elephants; burnished ornaments for cars; armour of warriors; and hides of horses and elephants. And swords and bows and bow-strings and arrows and tomaras300 and ankuças301 and darts. And blankets and chowris and tiger-skins and musk and other things. And pearls and excellent gems; and edifices all around. And there the fire burneth heaps of various kinds of arms. And then the fire burnt various kinds of curious structures, and the dwellings of Rākshasas and all householders. And there the fire flaming up again and again burnt down by hundreds and thousands the houses of the denizons of Lankā,—clad in curious golden mail; and wearing wreaths and ornaments and attires; having their eyes wildly moving in intoxication; reeling in drink; those whose paramours were dressed in flowing apparels; or those wroth with their foes; or bearing maces and darts and swords in their hands; or engaged in eating or drinking; or asleep with their beloved on costly couches; or who, agitated with fright, were hastily going taking their sons with them.—And that fire burnt down firm-based rich dwellings furnished with innumerable apartments, and garnished with golden Moons and crescents,—and mansions having graceful crests; and variegated windows and daises raised there, embellished with rubies and lapises, and seeming to touch the Sun; and piles resembling mountains in grandeur,—and resonant with the cries of Kraunchas and peacocks and the tinklings of ornaments. And the flaming gateways all round appeared like clouds in the rainy season lighted up by lightning, or like the peaks of a mighty mountain ablaze with a forest-conflagration. And superb damsels asleep in lofty edifices,302 being burnt, cast away their ornaments and shrieked. And consumed by the fire, buildings began to drop down like the summits of a mighty mountain smit with the thunder-bolt of the thunderer. And those burning, appeared from a distance like the peaks of Himalaya aglow. And in consequence of those tops of the edifices burning and of the living flames, that night Lankā looked as if swarming with flowering Kinçukas. And with elephant-riders, and elephants, and steeds let loose, Lankā appeared like the Ocean at the hour of Universal tumbling,—with its ferocious aquatic animals whirling in wild chaos. Sometimes, an elephant seeing a steed let loose,—was flying away in fear; and sometimes a horse seeing a frightened elephant, was stopping, himself seized with fear.—And on Lankā burning, the mighty main with the reflection (of the conflagration) looked like an Ocean of red waters. And in a short time that city set on fire by the monkeys, looked like the earth glowing at the time of the Universal dissolution. And the cries of the females amidst the drift of smoke, heated by the flames, could be heard from an hundred Yojanas. And as Rākshasas having their bodies burnt came out of houses, monkeys eager for encounter on a sudden sprung upon them. And the shouts of the monkeys and the cries of the Rākshasas made the ten cardinal quarters and the ocean and the Earth resound."
 },
 {
  "Yuddhakāndam": "And on those high souled ones—both Rāma and Lakshmana—having been cured of their wounds, possessing themselves in calmness, took up their excellent bows. And Rāma drew that best of bows. And thereat there was heard a tremendous twang striking terror into the Rākshasas. And drawing his redoubtable bow, Rāma appeared like the reverend enraged Bhava, drawing his bow having sounds and instinct with Brahma energy. And the twang of Rāma's bow, drowning the roars of both the monkeys and the Rākshasas,—was alone heard. And the ululations of the monkeys and the cries of the Rākshasas and the rattle of Rāma's bow—these three filled the ten cardinal quarters. And with the shafts discharged from his bow, the gateway of the city resembling the summit of Kailāça was crushed in pieces, scattered around on the ground. And seeing Rāma's shafts in cars and dwellings, the preparations for conflict were pushed on with great vigor. And in consequence of the foremost Rākshasas preparing for fight, and emitting roars, that night appeared like the Fatal Night itself. And the foremost monkeys were directed by the high-souled Sugriva, saying,—\"Ye monkeys, do ye fight, approaching the gate lying at hand. But he that flyeth from his ranks, should be slain by main force\". As the principal monkeys stationed themselves at the gate, equipped with fire brands, wrath took possession of Rāvana. And as he yawned, the wind (blowing from his mouth), filled the ten cardinal regions; and his wrath resembled that appearing in the person of Rudra. And wrought up with a mighty rage, he sent forth Kumbha and Nikumbha—both sons of Kumbhakarna—in company with innumerable Rākshasas.—And in accordance with Rāvana's command, Yupāksha and Sonitāksha, and Prajangha, and Kampana went with Kumbhakarna's sons. And, setting up leonine roars, he commanded all those highly powerful Rākshasas, saying,—\"Do ye go this very day for battle\". Thus directed, those heroic Rākshasas, equipped with flaming weapons, went out, roaring again and again. And the firmament was illuminated with the splendour of the ornaments of the Rākshasas and the splendour of their persons and the fire kindled by the monkeys. And there the light of the Moon and that of the stars and the brilliance of their ornaments,—combined, lighted up the welkin.—And the beams of the Moon and the brilliance of the ornaments and the flaming splendour of the planets emblazoned all round the forces of the monkeys and Rākshasas. And the light of half-burnt houses, again, falling on the restless ripples of the sea, made it wear an extremely beautiful aspect. And those dreadful Rākshasa hosts, possessed of dreadful prowess and energy, were seen,—with ensigns and banners; excellent swords and paracwadhas,303 terrific steeds and cars and elephants rife with paths,304 and flaming darts and clubs and scimitars and yrāsas and tomaras and bows; bearing blazing prāsas; ringing with the tinklings of hundreds of balls; with their arms encased in golden networks; flourishing axes; whirling their mighty weapons; fixing shafts on their bows; making the air swoon away with the perfumes of their wreaths; extremely terrific; swarming with heroes; sending out sounds like those of the sea. And seeing the army of the Rākshasas incapable of being coped with advance, the monkey-forces began to move and send up loud cheers. And thereat that array of Rākshasas vehemently sprang forward before the force of the foe, like unto insects plunging into aflame. And whirling with their arms bludgeons and açanis, that army of Rākshasas appeared exceedingly grand. And the monkeys, eager for encounter, darted forward like maniacs; and began to despatch the night-rangers with rocks and trees and clenched fist. And Rākshasas possessed of dreadful prowess with whetted arrows swiftly cut off the heads of falling monkeys. And the Rākshasas ranged there, with their ears torn with teeth, or their heads broken by blows, or their limbs crushed with the discharge of crags. And in the same way other grim-visaged night-rangers slew with sharpened swords the foremost of monkeys on all sides. And one about to slay another was himself slain by the latter; and one, about to bring another down, was himself brought down (by his adversary), and one that was railing at another, was in turn rebuked by his enemy; and one who was going to bite his foe, was himself bitten by him. And one was crying 'Give,'305 and his adversary anon giveth; and another, again said,—'I will give. Why puttest thyself to trouble? Stay.' Thus there did they accost each other. And there was waged a terrific encounter between the monkeys and the Rākshasas,—in which arms lay scattered about; and armour and weapons strewn around; and mighty prācas306 were upraised; and which was fought with blows and darts and swords and Kuntalas.307 And in that conflict the Rākshasas slaughtered monkeys by tens and sevens. And then the monkeys hemmed in the Rākshasa-forces, with their apparels falling off and with their mail and standards strewn around."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "On that furious and destructive carnage proceeding. Angada, eager for encounter, approached the heroic Kampana. Thereat, challenging Angada in wrath, he assailed him with impetuosity. And Kampana dealt a blow to Angada with his mace; and thereat, wounded with it, he reeled. Then regaining his senses, that energetic one hurled a mountain-top. Borne down by the blow, Akampana dropped down to the earth. And seeing Kampana slain in the conflict, Sonitāksha mounted on a car, intrepidly rushed against Angada. And he then impetuosly pierced Angada with sharpened shafts, keen and capable of cleaving the body and resembling the Fatal Fire itself in appearance,—with Kshuras308 and Kshurapras309 and Nārāchas310 and Vatsadantas311 and Siliumkhas312 and Karnis313 and Salas314 and Vipātas,315 and countless (other) whetted arrows. And the powerful son of Vāli—Angada—endowed with prowess having his person pierced with arrows suddenly smashed (his adversary's) car and arrows and dreadful bow. And thereat, Sonitāksha swiftly took up his sword and shield; and without reflecting for a moment, that vigorous one sprang forward. And the powerful Angada, speedily bounding up, seized his enemy's sword and holding the same with his hands shouted. And then hitting at (Akampana's) shoulder-blade, that powerful monkey—Angada—hewed him in twain, his blow going obliquely down like the sacred thread. And taking that terrific sword, and shouting again and again, in the field, Vāli's son rushed against other enemies. And then strong and heroic Yupaksha accompanied by Prajangha,—mounted on a car, wrathfully approached the mighty son of Vāli. And taking an iron mace, that hero, Sonitāksha, adorned with a golden angada,—attaining a little respite, advanced against Angada. And that redoubtable hero, the powerful Prajangha, also, accompanied by Yupāksha, fired with wrath, equipped with a mace, advanced towards the son of Vāli endowed with exceeding prowess. And placed between those two—Sonitāksha and Prajangha—that foremost of monkeys appeared like the full Moon placed between the Visākhas.316 And Mainda and Dwivida defending Angada, remained beside him, desirous of witnessing the encounter between those two (combatants). And fired with fury, those huge-bodied Rākshasas endowed with dreadful prowess, equipped with swords and shafts and maces,—being on their guard, fell upon the monkeys. And the encounter that took place between those three lords of monkeys combined (on one side), and the three redoubtable Rakshasis (on the other), was dreadful and capable of making people's down stand on end. And they,317 taking up trees, hurled them in the conflict (against their antagonists); and the powerful Prājangha resisted all those with his swords. And (the monkeys) in the contest showered rocks and trees on the cars (of their enemies) and the exceedingly strong Yupāksha cut them off with vollies of arrows. And the powerful Sonitāksha, endowed with prowess, with his mace severed in the middle the trees which Dwivida and Mainda had uprooted and discharged. And summoning speed, Prājangha darted against Vāli's son, upraising a huge scimitar capable of piercing into the vitals of trees. And seeing him approach, that lord of monkeys possessed of exceeding strength and great prowess struck him with an Açwakarna tree; and with a blow smote his antagonist on his arm holding a nistringa. And seeing the sword resembling a mace dropped to the earth, that exceedingly mighty one clenched his fist into a blow like unto the levin; and that one, endowed with wondrous energy, smote in the forehead that foremost of monkeys possessed of redoubtable prowess. And thereat he for a moment was staggered. And then recovering his senses, the energetic and powerful son of Vāli by means of his clenched fist severed Prājangha's head from his body. Thereat Yupāksha, seeing his uncle slain in battle, with his eyes filled with tears, finding his shafts exhausted, swiftly descended from his car and took a sword. And finding Yupāksha charge, Dwivida, waxing wroth, speedily smote him on the breast; and that powerful one also seized him. And finding his brother taken, the highly energetic Sonitāksha then dealt the mighty Dwivida a blow in the chest. And overcome by that blow, that one endowed with great strength, shook; and Dwivida seized his antagonist's upraised mace. In the meanwhile Mainda came to the side of Dwivida. And Sonitāksha and Yupāksha, bestirring themselves, began to vehemently and forcibly drag and pull those (two) monkeys. And Dwivida with his nail tore Sonhaksha's face; and that powerful one violently bringing him down to the earth, pressed him with might and main. And fired with wrath, Mainda—foremost of monkeys—grasped Yupāksha with his arms; and that one dropt down dead on the earth. And thereupon the force of the lord of the Rākshasas, having its foremost heroes slain,—and aggrieved thereat, went to where Kumbhakarna's son was. And then cheering up the flying forces, that best (of Rakshas),—the energetic Kumbha—seeing that Raksha host with its mighty heroes slain by highly powerful monkeys crowned with success, began to perform difficult feats in the encounter. And needfully taking his bow, that first of bowmen discharged shafts resembling venomous serpents capable of piercing the body. And his excellent bow with shafts shone resplendent like the very bow of Indra himself affluent with the splendour of Airāvata and lightning. And then drawing his bow to its utmost bent, he hit Dwivida with a feathered shaft knobbed with gold. And suddenly wounded with it, that best of monkeys having the splendour of Trikuta, fell down senseless to the earth, stretching his legs wide. And Mainda, seeing his brother, broken in mighty encounter, furiously rushed forward, taking a gigantic crag; and that one possessed of great strength, hurled it at the Rākshasa. And thereat Kumbha severed that crag with fire shafts discharged (from his bow). And then aiming other fair-headed arrows resembling venomous snakes, that exceedingly energetic one smote Dwivida's elder brother in the chest. And struck (with those arrows), that leader of monkey-bands, Mainda, with his marrow pierced therewith, fell down to the earth, deprived of his senses. And Angada seeing his uncles318 endowed with exceeding prowess, overpowered, darted vehemently at Kumbha staying with bow upraised. And as he descended, Kumbha pierced him with fire shafts; and as one pierceth an elephant with tomaras, he also pierced (Angada) with three other arrows. And the powerful Kumbha pierced Angada with a great many arrows, sharp-pointed, whetted, keen and ornamented with gold. And Vāli's son Angada, albeit pierced all over in his person, did not shake; and he kept showering on his319 head stones and trees. And the graceful son of Kumbhakarna cut off and cleft all those (stone and trees) discharged by Vāli's son. And seeing him spring up, Kumbha pierced that monkey-leader on the ground with shafts, even as one assaileth an elephant with fire-brands. And blood gushed out of his closed eyes. And then covering his eyes with his hand, Angada with another took a sāla that was hard by. And placing on his breast the sāla furnished with shoulders, and pulling its branches and bending its top, he cleared it of its foliage, in that mighty encounter. And then in the sight of all the Rakshas he violently discharged that tree resembling the very banner of Indra and appearing like Mandara itself. And thereat he320 severed it with seven sharp shafts capable of piercing the body. And Angada experienced a sharp pang and fell down deprived of his senses. And seeing the invincible Angada down like ebbing sea, the foremost monkeys informed Rāghava of it. And Rāma, hearing that Vāli's son had come to grief in terrific fight, directed the principal monkeys, headed by Jāmbavān. And hearing Rāma's command, the monkeys, fired with wrath, charged Kumbha, staying with his bow upraised. And those powerful monkeys, with their eyes crimsoned with choler and bearing rocks and trees in their hands, were engaged in defending Angada. And Jāmbavān and Sushena and the monkey, Vegadarçi, wrought with wrath, darted against that hero—son unto Kumbhakarna. And seeing them spring forward; he covered up those exceedingly mighty lords of monkey, with showers of shafts, even as a crag obstructeth the course of a current. And even the great deep cannot see his own shores, those high-souled lord of monkeys, coining within the range of his arrows, could not even see. And seeing those monkeys sore distressed by the shafts, the king of the monkeys, Sugriva, in that conflict taking his brother's son on his back, rushed against the son of Kumbhakarna, even as a powerful lion rusheth at an elephant ranging on the slopes of a mountain. And that mighty monkey, uprooting many an açwakarna and other mighty trees of various kinds, discharged them (at the foe). And by means of his sharp arrows the graceful son of Kumbhakarna cut off that down-pour of trees covering the welkin; and incapable of being resisted. And being baffled those trees looked like çataghnis. And seeing that shower of trees riven by Kumbha, the graceful lord of the monkeys endowed with exceeding strength and prowess, did not feel any mortification. And suddenly attacked, he bearing those arrows, seized Kumbha's bow resembling in resplendence the very bow of Indra. And swiftly bounding up and performing that feat difficult of being achieved, he, exceedingly enraged, addressed Kumbha resembling an elephant shorn of his tusks, saying,—\"O elder brother of Nikumbha, marvellous are thy might and the force of thyself as well as the modesty and prowess that are thine and Rāvana's. And, O thou equal unto Prahrada or Vāli or the slayer of Vritra or Varuna or Kuvera! thou alone walkest in the wake of thy yet mightier father. As mental anguish doth not dog one that hath controlled his senses,—the celestials cannot cope in conflict with thee alone, O repressor of foes, O of mighty arms, bearing thy dart in thy hand. O thou of high intelligence, put forth thy prowess! and do thou also witness my work. It is only by virtue of the boon he hath received, that thy uncle can bear the deities and the Dānavas. But Kumbhakarna copeth with the immortals and Asuras by means of his native might. And in the bow equal to Indrajit himself and in power equal to Rāvana, thou now in might and energy art the foremost of Rākshasas. And to-day let all creatures witness the mighty and wonderful encounter in conflict between thee and me, like unto the meeting of Sakra and Samvara. And unparalleled is the feat thou hast performed; and thou hast displayed thy skill in weapons. And heroic monkeys endowed with dreadful vigor, have been brought down by thee. And, O hero it is only because of the apprehension321 of censure of the people that I do not slay thee who art fatigued in consequence of the acts that thou hast performed. And reposing from fight, do thou see my strength!\" And being thus honored (by Sugriva) with fair speech, (Kumbha) flamed up like a flame into which oblations have been poured. And then Kumbha seized Sugriva by the arms. And like two elephants in rut, they sighing momentarily, fastened on each other's person, and possessed each other,—and from fatigue emitting from their mouth flames mixed with vapour And with the stamping of their feet, the earth was rent into rivers, and the main was waxed, with its billows surging furiously. Then Sugriva lifting up Kumbha clean, violently plunged him into the salt wash, making his eyes acquainted with the locality of the deep. And in consequence of Kumbha's plunge, the waters heaving up, rolled on all sides like the Vindhya or Mandara. Then springing up, and bringing Sugriva down, Kumbha, transported with wrath dealt a blow on his chest, like unto the levin. And thereat his skin was rent, and blood began to gush out,—and the impetus of that blow broke Sugriva's bones. And the vehemence (of the blow) caused a great fire to blaze up at that spot; even as the thunder-bolt smiting the mountain Meru, maketh place blazed. And the mighty Sugriva—foremost of monkeys—sorely handled by him, fastened his fingers into a box resembling the thunder-bolt, and furnished with all the effulgence of the solar disc having a thousand rays. And then that powerful one made that blow descend right on Kumbha's breast. And agonised with that stroke, Kumbha reft of his senses, dropped like unto a fire that hath lost its brightness. And overpowered by that blow, the Rākshasa anon dropped down, like unto the bright Lohitānga dropping from the firmament urged on by Destiny. And the aspect of the falling Kumbha with his breast broken by the blow, appeared like that of the Sun routed by Rudra. And on his being slain, in encounter, by the foremost of monkeys endowed with terrific strength, the earth with her hills and woods, shook; and a mighty fear took possession of the Rakshas."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Seeing his brother slain by Sugriva, Nikumbha, gazed at the lord of the monkeys, as if consuming him with his passion. And then that one endowed with calmness, grasped a bludgeon entwined with wreaths, and furnished with an iron ring measuring five fingers, and resembling the top of the Mahendra;322 plated with gold and embellished with diamonds and lapises,—and looking like the rod of Yama himself; dreadful, and capable of removing the fear of the Rakshas. And whirling this, that highly powerful one, resembling the banner itself of Sakra in energy, Nikumbha possessed of terrific strength, with his mouth wide open, set up shouts. And with gold adorning his breast, and angadas placed on his arms and a pair of curious and variegated earrings, Nikumbha, with his ornaments and that same bludgeon, appeared beautiful like a mass of roaring clouds laughing with lightning and furnished with the iris. And the head of that huge-bodied hero's parigha undid the conjunction of the Seven323 Winds and appeared324 like a noiseless and smokeless flame. Along with the gyration of Nikumbha's parigha the whole welkin, together with the excellent city325 of the Gandharbas, and the planets, stars and the moon, began to whirl. And Nikumbha was hard to approach like unto the fire of dissolution, being resplendent with the brilliance of parigha and other ornaments and having his anger for its fuels. And the Rākshasas and monkeys did not dare stir even out of fear. And the heroic Hanumān, spreading his breast, stood before him. And thereat the powerful (Nikumbha) having long-arms326 threw his parigha resembling the Sun at the breast of that powerful one. And falling on the firm and spacious breast of Hanumān it was broken into hundred pieces. And the broken portions, being scattered, appeared like hundreds of fire-brands in the sky. Like unto a mountain standing still even at the time of an earthquake that mighty monkey was not moved albeit struck with the parigha. Being thus hurt that highly powerful Hanumān, the foremost of the monkeys, with great velocity clenched his fist. And with this, the powerful (monkey) gifted with great impetuosity, and resembling the wind in prowess, struck Nikumbha on his breast. And with that fist, his (Nikumbha's) armour327 was riven and blood gushed out. And a light rising out of his breast suddenly disappeared like unto lightning disappearing in a mass of clouds. And being struck with his (Hanumān's) fist Nikumbha was greatly moved and restoring himself attacked the mighty Hanumān and pulled him up. And beholding in conflict the terrible and powerful Hanumān pulled up by Nikumbha, the residents of Lankā began to shout with joy. Being thus put to shame by that Raksha, Hanumān the son of the Wind, struck him with his iron fist. And releasing himself from the grasp of Nikumbha, Hanumān the Wind-god's son instantly planted his foot on the earth. Inflamed with ire, he, throwing down Nikumbha, began to crush him; and gifted with vehemence, he, with great impetuosity, leaped up and sat on the breast (of the Raksha). And holding his head with two hands, he, emitting loud roars, displaced his head. Nikumbha being thus slain in conflict by the Wind-god's son, there ensued a terrible conflict between the highly enraged armies of the son of Daçaratha and the lord of Rākshasas. And Nikumbha being deprived of his life, the monkeys began to shout—as if resounding all the quarters. And with it the whole earth moved and the abode of the celestials dropped down. And the Rākshasa-hosts were greatly terrified."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Beholding Kumbha and Nikumbha slain, Rāvana was excited with ire like unto flaming fire. And being beside himself, simultaneously with wrath and grief Rāvana328 spoke unto Makarāksha, Khara's son, having spacious eyes, saying—\"O child, do thou proceed at my command with the army and destroy Rāghava and Lakshmana with all the monkeys\". Hearing the words of Rāvana, Khara's son, Makarāksha, proud of his own prowess, delightedly spoke unto the night-ranger, saying, \"Be it so\". And saluting and circumambulating the Ten-necked one, that hero, at Rāvana's behest, issued out of the house. And Khara's son spoke unto the commander who was near him, saying,—\"Do thou speedily bring the chariot here and all the soldiers\". And hearing his words, that commanding night-ranger, soon led before him the army and the chariot. And going round the chariot and addressing the charioteer that night-ranger (Makarāksha) said,—\"O charioteer, do thou soon drive the chariot\". And Makarāksha addressed those Rākshasas, saying,—\"O Rākshasas! do ye all fight before me. I have been commanded by the high-souled Rāvana, the lord of Rākshasas, to slay both Rāma and Lakshmana in conflict. I shall slay to-day, O night-ranger, with my excellent arrows, Rāma, Lakshmana, Sugriva and all other monkeys. Like unto fire consuming dry fuel, shall I to-day slay the host of monkeys with my darts\". Hearing those words of Makarāksha, the mighty night-rangers, (addressed themselves for fight). They were armed with various weapons, cautious; assuming shapes at will, crooked, having fearful teeth, coppery eyes; roaring like elephants, having dishevelled hair and terrible. And encircling the huge-bodied son of Khara, those gigantic (Rākshasas) began to proceed, delighted and moving the earth (with the weight of their persons). There arose a terrible noise on all sides from the sound of conches, and thousands of bugles, and from the moving of the arms of the heroes. And all on a sudden the reins slipped off (the hands of) the charioteer and the flag of the Rākshasas dropped down. And the course of the steeds was thus slackend and they began to move slowly and poorly with their heads drooping down. There blew a terribly rough wind mixed with dust when the fearfully wicked-minded Makarākshas issued out for battle. Those powerful Rākshasas neglecting those bad omens proceeded towards where Rāma and Lakshmana were. They were all black like unto clouds, elephants and buffaloes, and had marks of swords and maces on their persons. And all those night rangers were skilled in the art of warfare and began to range to and fro (in the battle field) saying, \"I shall go first\"."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Beholding Makarāksha out for battle, those foremost monkeys, leaping on a sudden, addressed themselves for fight. Thereupon ensued a terrible conflict, capable of making one's down stand on end, between the night-rangers and the monkeys like unto one between the celestials and Dānavas. And those monkeys and night-rangers crushed each other down with trees, darts, maces and parighas. And those night-rangers began to assail those foremost of monkeys with sakti,329 swords, maces, kuntas, tomaras, pattiças, Vindipalas,330 arrows, nooses and clubs. Being thus assailed with fearful arrows by Khara's son, those monkeys, stricken with fear, fled away. And beholding the monkeys fly away, the victorious Rākshasas began to roar like excited lions. The monkeys thus flying away to all quarters, Rāma with a downpour of shafts assailed the Rākshasas. And beholding the Rākshasas thus overpowered, the night ranger Makarāksha, excited with the flame of ire, said,—\"Stay, O Rāma, let us both fight with each other; I shall take thy life with sharp arrows discharged off my bow. Thou didst slay my father in the forest of Dandaka. Remembering thy action and finding thee before, my ire is excited. O Rāghava! Vicious souled one! My limbs are being burnt (with wrath) for I did not see thee then in that mighty forest. O Rāma, by my good luck, I have got thee to-day, like unto a hungry lion desiring to have other animals. Being despatched by my arrows to the world of devils, thou shalt live with those heroes, who had been killed by thee before. What is the use of speaking more, O Rāma, do thou hear my words. Let all the people behold thy as well as my prowess in the battlefield. Either with weapon or with clubs, in whatever thou art expert, do thou fight with me in the battle-field, O Rāma\". Hearing the words of Makarāksha, Rāma, Daçaratha's son, smiling, replied to the words of the babbler. \"O Raksha, what is the use of idle prating? None can achieve success in battle with idle words—but with fighting. I slew in the forest of Dandaka thy father with fourteen thousand Rākshasas, Triçira and Dushana. O vile one, thou being slain to day, with thy flesh, vultures and crows, having sharp beaks and nails, and jackals shall be satisfied.331 Being thus addressed by Rāghava, the mighty Makarāksha, began to dart sharp arrows towards him in the battle-field. And Rāma, with his shafts, sundered into several pieces, those arrows. And being thus rendered useless those arrows, feathered in gold, fell down on the earth. Then there arose a terrible conflict between the Rākshasa Khara's son and Daçaratha's son. And there were audible in that battle-field, the outcry of the heroes and the twang of the bows stretched by their hands, like unto the muttering of the clouds in the sky. And to beheld that wondrous conflict, the celestials, Dānavas, Gandharbas, Kinnaras and the mighty serpents stationed themselves in the sky. They were wounded with the arrows discharged by each other and their strength was doubled. And they began to fight in that battle-field one attacking and the other withstanding the attack. And in that conflict the Rākshasa sundered the shafts discharged by Rāma. And likewise Rāma severed into several pieces the arrows shot by the Rākshasa. All the quarters were covered with arrows and nothing on earth or in the sky was visible. Thereupon being excited with ire, Rāghava of long arms sundered his (Rākshasa's) bow in conflict and with eight Nārachas pierced the charioteer. And with arrows Rāma sundered the chariot and killing the horses brought them down. And the night-ranger Makarāksha was brought down on the earth from the chariot. He then again rose up with a dart in his hand creating terror unto all creatures and resembling the Fire of Dissolution in resplendence. It was a terribly huge dart conferred on him by Siva, shining in the sky in its native brilliance and like unto another weapon of destruction.332 And beholding which dart even the celestials fly away in fear to different quarters. And taking up that huge flaming dart, the night-ranger, being excited with ire, hurled it at the high-souled Rāghava. And Rāghava, with four shafts, sundered that dart, in the sky, flaming and hurled at him by the son of Khara. And that flaming dart, feathered in gold, being splintered into several pieces by Rāma's arrows fell down on earth like a huge fire-brand. And beholding that dart baffled thus by Rāma of unwearied actions all those, stationed in the welkin began to shout, \"Well done! Well done!!\" And beholding his dart thus sundered, the night-ranger Makarāksha clenching his fist spoke unto Kākutstha, saying, \"Stay! Stay!\" And seeing him advance thus, the descendant of Raghu, smiling, fixed a fiery arrow on his bow. And with that arrow the Raksha was slain by Kākutstha in battle. And having his heart pierced he fell down and died. And beholding Makarāksha thus slain all the Rākshasas, being afraid of Rāma's arrows, proceeded towards Lankā. And seeing that night-ranger, the son of Khara, slain by Rāma's arrows, like unto a mountain clept by a thunder-bolt, the celestials were greatly delighted."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Hearing of the destruction of Makarāksha, the heroic Rāvana, being excited with ire, began to grind his teeth. Being thus angered, and thinking within himself what steps to take, he ordered his son Indrajit to proceed to the battle-field. \"O hero, gifted with great prowess as thou art, do thou, hidden (in clouds) or appearing before them, slay the two heroic brothers Rāma and Lakshmana. Thou didst defeat in conflict Indra of unequalled prowess. Shalt thou then neglect to slay men as they are?\" Being thus addressed by the lord of the Rākshasas and obeying his father's command, Indrajit proceeded towards the sacrificial ground to satisfy Fire (with oblations). There came some she-demons with crimson turbans and waited respectfully where Rāvana's son was offering oblations unto Fire. In that sacrifice the weapons were the leaves of sara,333 bibhutaks334 were fuels, and there were brought crimson clothes and sruvas335 made of black iron. And spreading fire on all sides with sara leaves and tomaras, (Indrajit) caught a living goat, all black, by the neck. And the fire, with oblations of sara, became greatly blazed and devoid of smoke. And there were visible many good omens indicating victory. The flame of the fire was like unto gold, and moving Southwards began to receive offerings of clarified butter. And thus offering oblations unto fire and unto celestials, Dānavas and Rākshasas, he ascended an excellent car and soon disappeared. It was drawn by four horses and a huge bow, set with sharp arrows, appeared beautiful on that excellent car. The chariot was brilliant with its own native resplendence, adorned with gold and painted with the figures of deer and a cresent. It was encircled on all sides with golden bracelets, adorned with flags made of vaidurja and was like unto the flaming fire. And being thus well protected with Brahmā weapons resembling the Sun in brilliance, the mighty son of Rāvana became invincible. And offering oblations unto Fire in accordance with demonaic incantations and thus obtaining the power of hiding himself, that hero, ever victorious in battle, issued out of the city and said,—\"Slaying these two brothers in battle, who have uselessly wandered away into the forest, shall I crown my father Rāvana with victory. Destroying Rāma and Lakshmana, and clearing the monkeys off the earth, shall I satisfy my sire greatly\". Saying this, he disappeared from their view. Thereupon that fearful foe of the lord of celestials appeared in the battle-field, excited with wrath, armed with bow and sharp Nārachas and commissioned thus by the Ten-necked one. He beheld there those two heroes discharging flaming arrows and surrounded by the monkeys like unto the fearful three-hooded serpent in the midst of other serpents. And thinking \"these must be Rāma and Lakshmana,\" and stretching his bow he began showering arrows like unto clouds. He was seated in a car in the welkin and hidden from the human gaze and began to assail Rāma and Lakshmana with sharp shafts. And being hurt with the arrows, Rāma and Lakshmana, fixing arrows on their bows, began to discharge celestial shafts. And those two highly powerful heroes could not even touch his person with their arrows resembling the Sun albeit they covered the whole welkin therewith. And clouding the whole sky with smoke that effulgent one, enveloped in frost, hid himself from their gaze. There was not audible the twang of his bow, the sound of the wheels, or the noise of the steeds. Nor was he seen by any. In that terrible darkness of clouds that one of mighty arms began to make a downpour of Nārachas and arrows like hail storms. And in that encounter, Rāvana's son, inflamed with ire, wounded Rāma, with shafts, resembling the Sun and obtained by him as a boon. And being hurt with Nārachas, like unto mountains wet with rain, those two foremost of men, began to discharge shafts feathered in gold. And reaching the son of Rāvana in the sky and soaked in blood those golden arrows, fell down on earth. And those two best of men, hurt with his arrows, became more effulgent and baffled the shafts discharged by the Rākshasa. Thereupon Rāma and Lakshmana began to aim their sharp shafts to the direction whence the arrows came down. And stationed in his chariot that mighty car-warrior disturbed all quarters with his arrows and pierced Daçaratha's sons with sharp shafts won by him. And being greatly hurt with those sharp-pointed and terrible arrows Rāma and Lakshmana appeared like blossoming kingsukas. Like unto the sun hidden in clouds they could see neither his countenance and motion, nor his bow and arrows. And being wounded with those arrows hundreds of monkeys died and fell down on the earth. Thereupon Lakshmana, being excited with wrath, spoke unto his brother, saying—\"To slay all the Rākshasas shall I discharge to-day Brahmā weapon\". Thereupon Rāma spoke unto Lakshmana, gifted with auspicious marks, saying—\"It doth not behove thee to clear all the Rākshasas off the earth for the folly of one individual. Thou shouldst not slay him, who hath retired from battle, hath hidden himself, hath sought thy shelter, hath stood before thee with joined palms, hath fled away or who is bewildered. O thou of mighty-arms, let us try to slay him (Indrajit). And to accomplish it I shall use the weapons gifted with great impetuosity and resembling the serpents. He is hidden from the public gaze so we must slay him—had he been fighting openly the leaders of the monkey hosts could have slain that Rākshasa. Truly he shall be burnt to death with my shafts and fall down on the earth albeit he entereth the regions under the earth or the abode of the celestials\". Having said these words pregnant with a high significance, the high-souled and heroic descendant of Raghu, being surrounded by monkeys, began to concert various plans for the destruction of that terrible Rākshasa of wicked deeds."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Having read the intention of that high-souled Rāghava, he retired from the battle-field and entered into the city of Lankā. And remembering the destruction of many a quick-paced Rākshasa, his eyes were rendered coppery with ire; and that hero, the son of Rāvana, issued out of the city again. And that highly powerful, Indrajit, a descendant of Pulasta and an enemy of the celestials, issued out, encircled by the Rākshasas, by the western gate. And beholding the heroic brothers Rāma and Lakshmana prepared for fight, Indrajit spread illusions. And placing an illusory figure of Sitā on the car, encircled by a huge army he began to make arrangements for her destruction. And desiring to charm all with his illusions, that one of wicked intent, preparing himself to slay Sitā, proceeded towards the monkeys. And beholding him thus proceed, the monkeys, inflamed with ire, desirous of fighting and with crags in their hands, moved on, And preceded them all, Hanumān, the foremost of the monkeys, with a huge mountain-top in his hand. He beheld there, on Indrajit's car, Sitā, deprived of all joy, poorly, greatly reduced with fasts and wearing a single braid. And Rāghava's beloved spouse wore a piece of soiled cloth, and though highly beautiful, the grace of her person was greatly spoiled with dirt. That daughter of Janaka, was not seen by him for a long time. And beholding her and deciding instantly that she is the daughter of Mithilā, (he became greatly sorry). And seeing her on the car, innocent, poor, deprived of joy and brought under the influence of the son of the lord of Rākshasas that great monkey thought within himself—'What must be the intention of Indrajit?' and accompanied by heroic monkeys advanced towards the son of Rāvana. And beholding that monkey host, Rāvana's son became beside himself with ire and unsheathing his weapon Nistrinsha, caught her by the hair. And that Rākshasa addressed himself to strike her in the presence of all those monkeys, and that illusory figure of Sitā began to bewail saying, \"O Rāma! O Rāma!\" And seeing her thus caught by the head, Hanumān, the son of Maruta, greatly sorry, began to shed tears. And beholding that beloved spouse of Rāma, having a tender and beautiful person, he addressed angrily the son of the lord of Rākshasas with harsh words. \"It is for thy destruction, O Vicious-souled one! that thou hast touched her hair. Being descended from that great Brahmā ascetic thou art born as a Rākshasa. O! cursed art thou, since thou hast cherished such a desire and engaged in such a vicious deed. O vile! O wicked! O cruel and dishonorable wight! O thou having vice for thy prowess! O shameless! Art thou not ashamed of perpetrating such an inhuman deed. What hath Maithili done by thee, O cruel one! that thou art ready to slay her—She hath been banished from her home, territory and hath been separated from her lord. O thou worthy of being slain, destroying Sitā, thou shalt not live long as thou hast been brought under me. Thou shalt after the death reach the place which is occupied by those who murder women—a place which is avoided even by those who commit every sort of crime punishable by law\". Saying this Hanumān, accompanied by monkeys armed with weapons, and excited with ire, proceeded towards the son of the lord of Rākshasas. Beholding the highly powerful monkeys advance thus the Rākshasas, inflamed with wrath, obstructed them. And assailing the monkey-hosts with thousands of arrows, Indrajit spoke unto that foremost of monkeys, Hanumān, saying,—\"To-day I shall slay before you all Vaidehi, for whom thou, Sugriva and Rāma have come. Slaying her, O monkey, I shall afterwards kill thee, Rāma, Lakshmana and Sugriva and the dishonorable Bibhisana. And, O monkey, about not destroying women, of which thou wert speaking (I might say) that we must always do what pains our enemies\".336 Saying this, Indrajit with a sharp sword, himself killed the illusory Sitā thus bewailing. And being sundered by him obliquely in a way in which a sacred thread lies on one's own person, the innocent (Sitā) having a beautiful countenance fell down on the earth. And slaying her Indrajit spoke unto Hanumān, saying,—\"Behold I have slain (before thee) with my sword Rāma's beloved. And Vaidehi being thus slain, all your labours have been rendered useless\". And destroying her with his own hand by means of a huge sword, Indrajit, greatly pleased ascended his car and began to emit dreadful roars. And the monkeys stationed near heard that terrible roar and saw him enter the castle.337 And slaying Sitā338 that wicked-minded son of Rāvana became greatly pleased. And beholding him thus delighted the monkeys being greatly sorry fled away."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Hearing that dreadful uproar resembling the sound of Indra's thunder-bolt, the monkeys, casting their looks on all sides fled away. Thereupon Hanumān, the son of Maruta, spoke unto them, poorly, terrified and of a sorrowful countenance, saying,—\"O monkeys, why do ye look so melancholy and why are you flying away? Why have ye renounced your earnest desire for fight? And where is your heroism gone? Do ye remain behind me, I shall go first in the battle\". Being thus addressed by that highly intelligent son of the Wind-god, they were greatly excited with wrath and being pleased took up trees and crags in their hands. And roaring thus the leading monkeys advanced towards the Rākshasas and stood encircling Hanumān in the battle-field. And being surrounded on all sides by leading monkeys, Hanumān began to burn down enemy's host like unto fire spreading its flames. And being encircled by monkey-hosts that mighty monkey resembling Death himself began to grind the Rākshasas. And being overwhelmed with grief and wrought up with ire, that monkey Hanumān, threw a huge crag on the car of that son of Rāvana. Beholding that crag about to fall down on the car, the charioteer moved his horses and it was speedily brought at some distance. And not reaching Indrajit stationed on the car and the charioteer, that crag, uselessly hurled, fell down on the earth. And that crag falling down many of the Rākshasas were crushed. Thereupon hundreds of huge-bodied monkeys, emitting cries and taking up crags and trees proceeded towards him (Indrajit) and hurled them at him. And the monkeys gifted with dreadful prowess began to make a down-pour of crags and trees. They thus assailed the enemies and frequently emitted cries. And the grim-visaged night-rangers were thus assailed with trees in that field by the terrible monkeys. Beholding his army thus distressed by the monkeys, Indrajit, excited with wrath, and taking up his dart, proceeded towards the enemies, and encircled by his soldiers showered terrible shafts upon them. And that one of dreadful prowess slew many a leading monkey by means of darts, Açanis, swords, pattiças and clubs. And the highly powerful monkeys destroyed his retinue, with crags, stones and trees having strong trunks. And Hanumān thus crushed many a Rākshasa of terrible deeds. Obstructing the Rākshasas (for some time) Hanumān spoke unto monkeys, saying,—\"Stay, we should not fight now. That daughter of Janaka hath been slain, for whom we have engaged in fight, renouncing all hope of life and desiring to accomplish Rāma's satisfaction. Let us now go and inform Rāma and Sugriva of it. And we shall do as we shall be commanded by them. Saying this and desisting all the monkeys from encounter that foremost of monkeys proceeded undaunted and heroically. And beholding Hanumān proceed thus where Rāghava was that wicked-minded one (Indrajit) with a view to offer oblations unto Fire entered the sacrificial altar Nikumbhilā. And reaching there Indrajit lighted up fire and began to pour oblations therein. And the Fire blazed up receiving oblations of blood, and being satisfied assumed the appearance of the setting sun. And Indrajit conversant with all ceremonials, offered oblations in due form for the welfare of the Rākshasas. And they all stood there watching the result and desirous of ascertaining the success of the battle.339"

 {
  "Yuddhakāndam": "Hearing the terrible war-cry of the Rākshasas and monkeys Rāghava spoke unto Jāmbavān, saying:—\"O gentle one, forsooth hath Hanumān performed some mighty act—for I hear the dreadful sound of the weapons. Do thou therefore proceed speedily, O lord of bears, with all thy soldiers to assist that foremost of monkeys."
 },
 {
  "Yuddhakāndam": "Thereupon, saying, 'So be it,' that king of bears, surrounded by his forces, approached the Western gate, where the monkey, Hanumān, was stationed. And then the lord of bears saw Hanumān approach, surrounded by monkeys sighing hard, who had faught the fight. And seeing on the way that host of bears dreadful and resembling dark clouds, on the march, Hanumān made them desist. And that illustrious one along with that force, speedily presented himself (before Rāma), and with a heavy heart addressed him, saying—\"As we were fighting in the field, Rāvana's son, Indrajit in our very sight slew Sitā, crying (in distress). O subduer of enemies, seeing her (in this plight) I, with my senses bewildered, have been overwhelmed with grief. Therefore I have come unto thee to inform thee of what hath befallen\". Hearing these words of his, Rāghava, overwhelmed with grief, dropped down to the earth, like a tree whose roots have been severed. Seeing the god-like Rāghava down on the earth, the foremost monkeys from all sides rushed forward and came to where (he was). And with water scented with lotuses,340 they fell to sprinkling that one resembling a furious fire341 that hath suddenly arisen. Thereat Lakshmana overcome with sorrow, embracing Rāma, spoke unto him words fraught with reason and import,—\"Profitless342 virtue is incapable, O noble one, of delivering from calamaties thee, who hast subdued thy senses, and who ever abidest in the good path. Beings and the mobile as well as the immobile cannot have that direct perception of virtue which they have of happiness. Therefore, I ween, virtue is a non-entity. Inasmuch as the mobile (albeit devoid of any regard for virtue) are nevertheless happy, and as the mobile also are so, this virtue cannot lead to happiness. (If it were so), one like thee would have not been placed in peril. If unrighteousness would bring unhappiness on creatures, Rāvana should hence to hell, and thou possessed of virtue, shouldst not come by misfortune. And seeing that he is free from danger, and thou art in it, righteousness and its opposite are found to have tendencies the very reverse of those assigned to them respectively (by the Vedas). And if by means of virtue, one attaineth the felicity attached to it, and by means of unrighteouness, one reapeth its proper fruit, then let those that are unrighteous reap the fruit of their impiety,—nor let those that set their face against sin, be deprived of the fruit of their righteousness; and let those that walk in the way of virtue reap the fruit of their piety. But as prosperity attendeth those that are established in un-righteousness, and as those regardful of righteousness fare lamentably,—these343 have not the senses assigned to them (by the scriptures). If, O Rāghava, (it is contended that) unrighteousness cutteth off the wicked, then whom shall unrighteousness, himself slain by the act of slaughter of the destroyer,—slay in his turn? Or if it is said that one is slain or slayeth another by ordinance, then it is Destiny, which is touched by the sinful act and not he. O chastiser of foes, incapable of meting out retribution,344—unmanifest itself, and non-existent, how can virtue, even if we grant its existence, find out the person that should be slain? If, O foremost of the good, it had existed, thou wouldst not have come by any misfortune. But inasmuch as thou hast fallen into this plight, there is no such thing as virtue. Or itself feeble and impotent, it taketh refuge in manliness. And being powerless and bereft of dignity, it should, I deem, by no means be followed. And if virtue is a property of manliness, then carefully forsaking virtue, do thou follow strength as thou hast hitherto followed virtue. But, O subduer of enemies, if truthfulness be virtue, art thou not bound by that departing from which the king lost his life?345 And, O chastiser of foes, if virtue must be practised above all, or if prowess must have precedence,—then the thunder-handed Satakratu would not have celebrated his sacrifice, slaying the ascetic.346 O Rāghava, virtue aided by prowess, destroyeth enemies. Therefore, O Kākutstha, people, for compassing their ends, resort to both virtue and prowess. This, sire, is my opinion: this, O Rāghava, is virtue. But thou, having then renounced the kingdom, hast laid the axe at the root347 of righteousness. Like streams issuing out mountains, all acts spring from wealth flowing from various regions and attaining magnitude. Like a shrunken stream in summer, all the acts of that foolish person who hath been divorced by wealth, are annihilated.—He that renouncing riches within his reach,348 hankers after enjoyment,—being carried away by his overmastering desire, taketh to getting at wealth by sinful acts; and then he incurreth guilt. Unto him that hath wealth are friends, unto him that hath wealth are acquaintances,—he that hath wealth is an individuality in this world, and he that hath wealth is a learned person. He that hath wealth is powerful; he that hath wealth is intelligent; he that hath wealth is mighty-armed; and he that hath wealth is full of all graces. All these that I have ennumerated are the evils of forsaking fortune. (I cannot divine) what made thee, renouncing the monarchy, to adopt such a course.—He that hath riches, hath virtue and desire attending on him, and hath everything auspicious. That one without wealth, that seeketh it, cannot secure the wealth of prowess, without riches and desire. And, O lord of men, cheerfulness, and desire, and pride, and piety, and anger, and self-restraint, and self-control—all these come from wealth. As the planets are not discovered on a stormy day, that wealth, the want of which renders this world naught even unto the ascetics practising righteousness,—is not visible in thee. O hero, thou having abode by the words of thy superior and having come (to the forest), thy wife dearer then life itself hath been ravished by Rakshas. But, O hero, to-day, O Rāghava, by my acts will I remove this huge sorrow that hath been heaped upon us by Indrajit. Therefore, rise thou up. Rise up, O foremost of men, O long-armed one, O thou who observest vows. Why dost thou not understand thyself as the Supreme Soul?349 And, O sinless one, urged on behalf of thy welfare, I, waxing wroth on hearing of the slaughter of Janaka's daughter, shall with my shafts entirely raze to the ground Lankā with cars and elephants and steeds and the foremost Rakshas\"."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "As Lakshmana devoted to his brother was comforting Rāma, Bibhishana, posting his forces at their proper quarters, came there, surrounded by four heroes accoutred in various arms, resembling masses of collyrium or leaders of elephant-herds. And approaching the high-souled Rāghava, overwhelmed with grief, he saw the monkeys with tears in their eyes. And he saw that joy of the Ikshwāku race—the high-souled Rāghava—stupified with grief, lying on the lap of Lakshmana. And seeing Rāma cast down and inflamed with grief, Bibhishana, inly pained, said,—'What is this?' Thereat, gazing at Bibhishana's countenance as well as all those monkeys, Lakshmana, with his eyes flooded with tears, said these words pregnant with dire import,—\"O placid one, hearing from Hanumān's lips that Sitā hath been slain by Indrajit, Rāghava hath been overcome with stupor\". As Sumitrā's son was speaking thus, Bibhishana, preventing him, addressed the stupified Rāma in these pregnant words,—\"O king, all that Hanumān in distressful guise had communicated unto thee I deem as improbable, like unto the drying of the deep. I know the intent of the impious Rāvana with reference to Sitā, O mighty-armed one. Her he will not slay. I, seeking his welfare, had besought him much, saying,—'Let go Vaidehi',—but he did not act up to my speech. Neither by conciliation, nor by gift, nor by dissension,—and where is war?—nor by any other means is one capable of obtaining the very sight of Sitā. Having bewildered the monkeys, the Rākshasa hath gone back; and, O mighty-armed one, know her to be the illusory daughter of Janaka. To-day, going to the sacrificial ground (called) Nikumbhila, he will offer oblations into fire; and there the deity of fire will present himself along with Vāsava and the (other) divinities. And then Rāvana's son shall be invincible in battle. Indubitably that illusion hath been wrought by him, to deceive (the monkeys), so that they might not through their prowess disturb him there. Thither will we go before he hath furnished his (sacrifice). O foremost of men, shake off this vain sorrow that hath overcome thee! Seeing thee smitten with grief, this entire host is dispirited. Here, with thy heart composed, do thou stay, summoning thy strength. Send Lakshmana along with us and the flower of the forces. This foremost of men by means of sharpened shafts will make Rāvana's son give up his rites; and then shall he be capable of being slain by us. These keen and sharpened shafts of his, attaining access of velocity through the feathers of birds, and themselves resembling fierce fowls, will drink his350 blood. Therefore, O mighty-armed one, do thou in order to the destruction of the Rākshasa, commission Lakshmana, even as the wielder of the thunder-bolt commandeth the same. And as to-day no time should be lost, therefore do thou send Lakshmana for compassing the destruction of the foe, even as Mahendra sendeth the thunder-bolt for bringing about the destruction of the enemies of the immortals. If that foremost of Rākshasas can finish his rites, he shall be invisible to both celestials and Asuras; and, he fighting after finishing his sacrifice, the celestials themselves shall be placed in great jeopardy\"."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Hearing his speech, Rāghava, overwhelmed with grief, could not perfectly comprehend what was said by the Rākshasa. Then, summoning up patience, Rāma—captor of hostile capitals—spoke unto Bibhishana, seated near the monkeys,—\"O lord of Nairitas, I once more wish to hear what, O Bibhishana, thou hast said\". Hearing Rāghava's words, Bibhishana, skilled in speech, again spoke these words, saying,—\"O mighty-armed one, I have stationed the forces, O hero, agreeably to thy directions. The entire force hath been divided around; and the leaders have also been placed properly. Further, O mighty master, listen to what I have to say. On thy having been causelessly aggrieved, we all of us were seized with grief. If this anxiety of thine conduceth to the joy of the enemy, do thou cast it off. And, O hero, bestir thyself,—and summon up spirits. If thou art to have Sitā, and if the night-rangers are to be slain by thee, do thou, O Raghu's son, listen to my profitable speech. Let Sumitrā's son go forth, environed by a mighty force, for slaying in battle the son of Rāvana, who hath gone to Nikumbhilā; with shafts resembling venomous serpents, discharged from the round351 of his bow. By virtue of his austerities, that hero, from a boon conferred by the Self-sprung, hath obtained the Brahmaçiras weapon, together with steeds coursing at their will. Now he with his army hath gone to Nikumbhilā; and when, having finished his rites, he gets up, know that all of us are slain. 'When not reaching Nikumbhilā, and not having finished thy offerings unto fire, thou, equipped with arms, art slain by a foe,—O enemy of Indra, that is thy death.'—Thus, O mighty-armed one, did the lord of all creatures confer a boon (on Indrajit), and, O king, thus was the death of this intelligent one ordained. O Rāma, for compassing the destruction of Indrajit, do thou commission a mighty force. On his being slain, know that Rāvana along with his retainers are slain\".—Hearing Bibhishana's words, Rāma said,—\"O thou having truth for prowess, I know the illusion of that fierce one. Without doubt, he is skilled in the Brahma weapon, is potent in illusion and, is possessed of exceeding strength. In conflict, he depriveth of consciousness even the celestials with Varuna (at their head). And as that illustrious (one) goeth about in the welkin on his chariot, none, O hero, can perceive his course, like the course of the Sun when the sky is covered with clouds\". And Rāghava, being well acquainted with the illusive energy of his wicked-minded foe, addressed the renowned Lakshmana, saying,—\"Environed by the entire host of the lord of monkeys,—accompanied by the leaders, O Lakshmana, headed by Hanumān,—with Jāmbavān~king of bears—and girt round by the forces,—do thou slay this son of the Rākshasa, possessed of the strength of illusion. And accompanied by his counsellors, this high-souled night-ranger shall follow at thy back, in this engagement with that one skilled in illusion\". Hearing Rāghava's words, Lakshmana endowed with dreadful prowess, with Bibhishana,—took up another excellent bow. And donning on his mail, and putting on his armour and his sword, and furnished with arrows, and a bow in his left hand,—Sumitrā's son, touching Rāma's feet, feeling elated, addressed Rāma, saying,—\"To-day the shafts discharged from my bow, piercing Rāvana's son, shall fall into Lankā, even as swans drop into a tank. This very day shall my arrows, shot from my redoubtable bow-string, rive the body of that terrific one\". Having spoken thus, the effulgent Lakshmana, eager to slay Rāvana's son, went before his brother. And having saluted at the feet of his superior and went round him, Lakshmana set out for the sacrificial ground (named) Nikumbhilā, protected by the son of Rāvana. And accompanied by Bibhishana, that powerful son of the king—Lakshmana—after his brother had offered up prayers in his behalf,—set off with all speed. And surrounded by thousands of monkeys, Hanumān as well as Bibhishana together with his counsellors—speedily went in the wake of Lakshmana. And strongly encompassed by that mighty monkey-host, (Lakshmana) saw the forces of the bear-king stationed on the way. And having proceeded far, Sumitrā's son—enhancer of the delight of friends—from a distance discovered the forces of the Rākshasa-monarch, drawn up in battle-array. And that subduer of enemies—Raghu's son—bearing his bow in his hand, coming upon him whoso martial might lay in illusion,—stopped (there) for conquering his foe agreeably to the ordinance352 of Brahmā. And accompanied by Bibhislnna, the heroic Angada, and the Wind-god's offspring, the powerful son of the king dived into the forces of the foe, various, blazing with burnished arms, dense with standards; And thronging with mighty cars,353 capable of striking terror (into the hearts of the spectators), instinct with immeasurable energy, and resembling darkness."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "When things were in this condition, Rāvana's younger brother addressed Lakshmana in words fraught with evil to foes and conducing to the welfare (of his own party), saying,—\"Do thou without delay bring on an engagement between this cloud-black Rākshasa army, which thou beholdest, and the monkeys having rocks for their arms. O Lakshmana, do thou exert thyself to break through his354 mighty army; and when the ranks are broken, the son of the Rākshasa-lord shall be visible. And scattering among the foes shafts resembling Indra's thunder-bolt, charge him while he hath not yet finished this ceremony. Slay, O hero, this wicked one, this son of Rāvana, given to illusion, and of terrific feats,—the fear of all the worlds\". Hearing Bibhishana's words, Lakshmana graced with auspicious marks began to shower arrows on the son of the Rākshasa-chief. And bears and monkeys, given to fighting excellently with trees, in a body rushed towards that army (of Rakshas) drawn up there. And the Rākshasas (on their part) burning to slaughter the monkey-forces, rushed in the encounter with sharpened shafts and darts and tomaras. And there took place a tremendous onslaught of the monkeys and the Rākshasas. And Lankā resounded all around with that mighty tumult; and the sky was covered with weapons of various shapes, and whetted arrows and trees and dreadful upraised mountain-tops. And Rākshasas having frightful faces and arms, plying their arms among the foremost monkeys, began to spread terror (there). And in the same way the monkeys in the conflict fell to slaying and wounding the Rākshasas with trees and hill-tops. And great was the terror that was spread among the warring Rākshasas by the flower of the bears and monkeys, possessed of gigantic persons and endowed with prodigious strength."

 {
  "Yuddhakāndam": "Hearing his own army hard beset by the enemies, and drooping,—the unconquerable one, ere yet he had finished his rites, rose up. And issuing from the gloom of the trees, Rāvana's son, fired with wrath, ascended his car, which had already been well yoked (with steeds). And accoutred in a dreadful bow and arrows,—that one resembling a mass of collyrium, having a red face and eyes, looked dreadful like the Reaper—Death. And soon as they saw him mounted on his car, that host of Rakshas possessed of dreadful impetuosity, eager to engage with Lakshmana, stood on their ground. At this time that subduer of enemies—Hanumān—resembling a mountain, uprooted a giant tree incapable of being bandied. And in that encounter, the monkey, consuming (the forces) like the fire risen at Doomsday, made that army of Rākshasas insensible with innumerable trees. And finding the Wind-god's son, Hanumān, suddenly spreading devastation among the Rākshasas by thousands, (they) showered (shafts) on him. And approaching on all sides that one resembling a hill, those bearing whetted darts attacked him with darts; those bearing swords in their hands, with swords; those bearing javelins in their hands, with javelins; with pattiças, those equipped with pattiças; and with bludgeons, and maces and graceful kuntas; and with hundreds of sataghnis, and iron clubs; and with terrific axes; and with bhindipālas; and with boxes like unto thunder-bolts; and slaps resembling the açani. And fired with fury, he (on his part) spread a huge havoc among them. And Indrajit saw that foremost of monkeys, resembling a hill, the offspring of the Wind-god—possessing himself in calmness, while destroying his foes. And thereat, he355 addressed his charioteer, saying,—\"Go where the monkey is. Being disregarded by the Rātkshasas, he makes havoc among us\". Thus accosted by him, the charioteer went where the Wind-god's offspring was, carrying the exceedingly invincible Indrajit seated on the car. And rushing forward, that irrepressible one—the Rākshasa—began to shower on the monkey's head arrows and swords and pattiças and scimitars and axes. And bearing all those dreadful arms, the Wind-god's offspring, overcome with a mighty rage said,—\"O wicked-minded son of Rāvana, if thou art a hero, fight on. Combat with me with thy arms. If in the encounter, thou bearest my impetus, then, O thou of perverse sense, thou indeed art the foremost of Rākshasas\". Then Bibhishana pointed out unto Lakshmana the son of Rāvana, who with his bow upraised, was eager to slay Hanumān. \"This one that, mounted on his car, is eager to slay Hanumān, is the son of Rāvana that hath vanquished Vāsava himself (in battle). Do thou, O son of Sumitrā, with peerless shafts capable of resisting enemies,—dreadful, and competent to finish the lives (of foes),—slay the son of Rāvana\". Thus accosted by Bibhishana terrific unto foes, that high-souled one saw (Indrajit) of dreadful prowess, difficult to get at, and resembling a hill,—stationed on his car."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Having spoken thus unto Sumitrā's son, Bibhishana experienced delight, and taking (Lakshmana) bearing a bow in his hand, hurriedly went off. And proceeding some way and entering the mighty wood, Bibhishana pointed out unto Lakshmana the (place of) sacrifice. And the energetic brother of Rāvana showed unto Lakshmana the Nyagrodha, dreadful to behold and resembling a mass of sable clouds. \"Here offering presents unto the ghosts, the powerful son of Rāvana afterwards engages in conflict. Then the Rākshasa becomes invisible to all beings; and he slayeth his enemies in battle and fastens them with excellent shafts. Do thou, ere he hath passed beyond the Nyagrodha, with flaming arrows destroy the powerful son of Rāvana along with his car and steeds and charioteer\". Thereupon saying,—'So be it,' the exceedingly energetic son of Sumitrā—that delight of his friends—took up his post there, stretching his variegated bow. And Rāvana's son Indrajit, endowed with strength, mailed, and armed with a sword, and furnished with a banner, was seen mounted on a fire-hued chariot. And the highly powerful Lakshmana addressed Pulastya's son, never knowing defeat, saying,—\"I challenge thee to the encounter. Do thou give me battle, exerting thy utmost\". Thus addressed, the exceedingly energetic and intelligent son of Rāvana, seeing Bibhishana there, spoke anto him harshly, thus,—\"Born and bred in this (Rākshasa race), thou art the very brother of my father. Why, O Rākshasa, being my uncle, dost thou range thyself against thy son? But neither kinship, nor emity, nor race, O wicked-minded one, nor co-birth, can, O destroyer of righteousness, avail to make thee discern thy duty. O thou of perverse understanding, thou art indeed to be pitied; as thou art worthy of being reproached by the virtuous; since, renouncing thine own, thou hast espoused servitude under another. Neither by thy character nor yet thy understanding dost thou perceive the mighty difference that lieth between living with one's own kindred, and taking refuge with the base. If one that is not our own, be furnished with every grace, and if one's own be void of all merit,—one's kindred, albeit unworthy, is preferable; and he that is not ours, is even always such. He that, forsaking his own party, serveth that of another, is destroyed even by the latter, when his own party is destroyed. O night-ranger, such is this thy relentlessness, that, O Rāvana's younger brother, thou being a kindred, art capable of displaying thy manliness (as no other person can do so)\". Thus addressed by his brother's son, Bibhishana answered,—\"O Rākshasa, why dost thou speak as if in ignorance of my character? O impious son of the Rākshasa-chief, do thou forego the roughness which thou assumest on behalf of my dignity.356 Albeit born in the race of Rakshas of cruel deeds, yet having regard to the first of principles pertaining to men, my character is not that of a Rākshasa. I do not take pleasure in the terrible; nor do I revel in unrighteousness. But how can a brother, although differing from his brother in character, be renounced by the latter?357 One renouncing a person, lapsing from virtue and bent on sinful acts, attaineth happiness, even as one doth by shaking off a venomous snake from his hand. The wise have called that impious one given to stealing others' goods and violating others' wives,—as worthy of being forsaken, even like a house that is aflame.—Robbing others' property, outraging the wives of others, and inspiring fear among friends,—these three vices lead to destruction. The dreadful slaughter of sages, rebellion against all ihe gods, overweening conceit, anger, long-continued enmity, and running amuck of counsel,—these sins are sapping the life and fortune of my brother; and they have hidden his virtues even as clouds cover a mountain. It is on account of these vices that my brother, thy sire, hath been deserted by me. And this city of Lankā will not be, nor thou, nor thy father. Thou art proud, and haughty, and a boy, O Rākshasa. Thou art fettered by the noose of Fate. Do thou say unto me whatever thou likest. To-day thou hast addressed harshly me, who have fallen on evil days; but, O worst of Rākshasas, thou canst not pass this Nyagrodha. Having smitten the Kākutstha, thou canst not live. Fight with that man-god, Lakshmana, in encounter. Being slain, thou shalt serve the deities in the abode of Yama. Displaying thy own prowess, do thou spend all thy weapons and all thy shafts. But coming within the ken of Lakshmana's arrows, thou wilt not to-day go hence, living, with thy forces\"."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Hearing Bibhishana's words, the son of Rāvana, deprived of his senses by passion, spoke harshly, and rushed forward in wrath. And with upraised weapons and scimitars, he, resembling the Destroyer himself, was mounted on a mighty car yoked with black steeds, and ornamented (on all sides). And that one endowed with terrific strength up-raised a huge, gigantic, strong and powerful bow, and shafts capable of destroying foes. And that mighty bowman and slayer of foes—the powerful son of Rāvana—adorned (with ornaments) and mounted on his chariot, saw him dight (with his own splendour). And fired with wrath, (Indrajit) addressed Sumitrā's son, who, mounted on Hanumān's back, like unto the risen sun in splendour—accompanied Bibhishana; and he also addressed all those principal monkeys, saying,—\"Do ye behold my prowess! To-day do ye in the conflict bear my arrowy shower shot from my bow, incapable of being approached, and resembling the down-pour in the sky. To-day my shafts discharged from my mighty bow shall mangle your limbs, even as fire burneth up a heap of cotton. To-day with your persons pierced with sharp shafts, with darts, and javelins, and rishtis and arrows, shall I despatch you all to the abode of Yama. Who shall stay before me, fleet-handed, creating an arrowy shower in the field, and roaring like unto clouds? Formerly in a night-engagement, with my shafts resembling the thunder-bolt and vajra, ye two along with your foremost adherents, were rendered insensible and laid down on the earth by me. But, perhaps, thou hast forgotten it. As thou hast presented thyself for battle before me, fired with wrath and resembling a venomous serpent, it is evident thou wilt go to the region of Yama\". Hearing the vaunt of the Rākshasa-chief, Raghu's son, inflamed with rage, with an undaunted countenance, spoke unto Rāvana's son,—\"O Rākshasa, hard is the achievement of the task that thou hast mentioned. He that compasseth business by act is alone intelligent.—But thou, O wicked-minded one, incompetent as thou art to bring about thy end, attaining thy arduous aim by words only, deemest thyself as crowned with success. That thou hadst rendered thyself invisible in the field of conflict, was the work of a thief,—and not the way of a hero. Coming within the range of thy shafts, I stay here,—do thou display thy prowess. What dost thou say in words?\" Thus addressed, the mighty Indrajit—conquerer of enemies—stretching his dreadful bow, showered sharpened shafts. And discharged by him, those exceedingly impetuous arrows, resembling the venom of serpents, hitting Lakshmana, fell down like unto hissing snakes. And in that encounter, Rāvana's son—Indrajit—possessed of eminent impetuosity, pierced Lakshmana, graced with auspicious marks, with vehement shafts. And pierced with those arrows and bathed in blood, the graceful Lakshmana appeared like a smokeless fire. And seeing his own feat, Indrajit, coming forward, and setting up a tremendous cry, said,—\"O son of Sumitrā, my feathered and sharp-edged shafts shot from my bow, capable of destroying life, will to-day finish thee up. To-day, O Lakshmana, swarms of jackals and hosts of hawks and vultures shall alight on thee lying lifeless, having been slain by me. This very day shall the exceedingly wicked Rāma behold thee, who art the friend of Kshatriyas and devoted unto thy brother,—and who ever bearest thyself ignobly,—slain by me; to-day see thee, O Sumitrā's son, slain by me, with thy armour fallen off thy person, thy bow broken, and thy head severed\". As Rāvana's son was speaking thus harshly, Lakshmana conversant with the import of words, replied in a reasonable speech, saying,—\"Leave off thy strength of tongue, O thou of perverse sense, O Rākshasa, O thou of crooked ways! Wherefore dost thou speak thus? Bring all this to pass in worthy deed. Why, O Rākshasa, without doing (what thou sayest), dost thou simply say it? Do the deed,—so that I may have regard for thy utterances. Mark! without speaking anything harsh, without censuring thee in the least, without venting any brag, shall, I, O cannibal, slay thee\". Saying this, Lakshmana drawing his bow to its full bent, hit at the Rākshasa's chest five nārāchas—wondrous impetuous arrows. And those arrows resembling flaming serpents, with their velocity accelerated by the feathers (with which they were furnished), blazed on the Nairita's breast like the rays of the Sun. And wounded with those shafts, Rāvana's son, fired with wrath, pierced Lakshmana with three arrows discharged (from his bow). And exceedingly dreadful was the encounter that took place between those leonine man and Rākshasa, each eager to conquer the other. And both powerful, and both endowed with strength and possessed of prowess,—and both exceedingly invincible; and both having unparalleled might and energy,—those heroes faught like two planets in the welkin; or like Bala and Vrita, irresistible in conflict; and those high-souled ones faught like two lions. And showering countless shafts and displaying many maneuvers, that foremost of men and that of Rākshasas, fought on cheerfully."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Then sighing like an enraged serpent, that chastiser of foes, Daçaratha's son, setting shafts (on his bow-string) showered them on the Rākshasa-chief. And hearing the twang of his bow-string the lord of Rākshasas, with his countenance fallen, gazed at Lakshmana. And then Bibhishana spoke unto Sumitrā's son as he was fighting, \"I find (inauspicious) signs in Rāvana's son. Do therefore hasten on,—broken he is, without doubt\". Then fixing arrows (on his bow) resembling venomous snakes, he let go those keen shafts, like unto serpents furnished with poison. And smit by Lakshmana with arrows having the touch of the levin, (Indrajit) for a while was stupified and had his senses overwhelmed. And eying that hero—son unto Daçaratha—present in the encounter, (Indrajit) with his eyes crimsoned in choler, drew near Sumitrā's son. And coming up to him (Lakshmana), he again addressed (that hero) in a harsh speech, saying,—\"Dost thou not remember my prowess at that first encounter, when thou along with thy brother was bound up,—that now thou art discharging arms (at me)? Forsooth ye two in mighty encounter, with shafts resembling the thunder-bolt and vajra, by me were first laid down on the ground, deprived of your lives, along with your principal adherents. Either this hath escaped thy memory or I fancy, thou plainly wishest to go to the abode of Yama,—inasmuch as thou hast set thy heart on beating me. If at the first encounter thou hast not witnessed my prowess, to-day shall I show it unto thee. Do thou now stay, summoning thy attention\". Seeing this, he pierced Lakshmana with seven shafts, and Hanumān with ten keen-edged excellent shafts. And then, fired with double fury, that powerful one pierced Bibhishana with an hundred arrows, powerfully discharged (from his weapons). Seeing this act of Indrajit, that foremost of men, Rāma's younger brother, Lakshmana, with an undaunted countenance, fired with wrath without minding the same,—and saying with a laugh,—'This is nothing',—taking dreadful arrows, in the conflict, discharged them at the son of Rāvana. \"O night-rangers, heroes, coming to the field never discharge (such shafts as these). These arrows of thine are light and of slight strength, and they conduce to my comfort. Heroic warriors, eager for encounter, do not fight thus\". Speaking thus, (Lakshmana) accoutred with his bow showered vollies of shafts (on his adversary). And at his arrows (hitting), (Indrajit's) mighty golden mail fell off his person, and dropped to the platform of his car like a cluster of stars dropping from the welkin. And with his armour dropping off, that hero—Indrajit—was wounded with nārāchas, like the Sun at dawn. That hero—Rāvana's son—endowed with dreadful prowess, in that conflict, pierced Lakshmana with a thousand shafts. And thereat Lakshmana's gorgeous and mighty mail was rent in pieces. And each rushing forward was engaged in dealing blows and harrying them. And sighing again and again, they fought furiously. And with their persons cut all over, and laved in blood, for a long while the heroes kept cleaving each other with sharpened shafts. And those high-souled ones versed in warfare, and endowed with terrific prowess exerted their utmost in securing victory. And covered with vollies of shafts, with their armour and banners rent, they drew each other's warm blood flowing like water from a fountain. And they discharged dreadful showers attended with tremendous sounds, like the sounds of black clouds at Dooms-day358 pouring torrents in the sky. And a long time went by as they faught. Nor did they turn away from the encounter, or know fatigue. And those foremost of those acquainted with weapons repeatedly displayed their weapons; and their long and short shafts enveloped the welkin. And the skill that they displayed was perfect, and showed lightness, variety and grace; and both man and the Rākshasa carried on fearful and terrible conflict. And the dreadful and tremendous roars of each were audible (at that place); and terrific like the levin, they made the hearts of hearers tremble (in terror). And as they faught with might and main, the sounds that they sent resembled the deep rumbling of clouds in the sky. And pierced with nārāchas knobbed with gold, those powerful and illustrious (warriors) with their hearts set on celebrity, bled profusely. And in that engagement gold-knobbed shafts hitting each other's person, pierced the same and covered with gore, entered the earth. And other shafts were resisted in the sky by sharpened weapons; and some were snapped, and thousands of their arrows were cleft (in the sky). And in that field, the vollies of their shafts were dreadful to behold like unto a heap of Kuça aflame in a sacrifice. And the wounded frames of those high-souled ones appeared beautiful like a leafless, flowering Kinçuka and Sālmali in a wood. And each eager to vanquish the other, Indrajit and Lakshmana momentarily discharged tremendous and terrific showers (of arms). And Lakshmana smiting Rāvana's son, and Rāvana's son smiting Lakshmana,—they did not experience any fatigue. And with net-works of arrows deeply entering their persons, those vehement and exceedingly powerful ones resembled mountains topped (with trees). And all their limbs, drenched in blood and covered with arrows, looked like a blazing fire. And a great while did they fight; yet they neither turned away (from the fight), nor did they experience any exhaustion. Then to remove (Lakshmana's) fatigue from fight, the high-souled Bibhishana, working the weal of Lakshmana staying in front of the field, came forward in the encounter and took up his post."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Seeing the man and the Rākshasa engaged in battle, with their whole soul, each eager to beat the other,—like unto elephants with the temporal juice trickling from their temples,—desirous of beholding their encounter, Rāvana's mighty and heroic brother, bearing an excellent bow, stood in front of the arena. And taking up his post, he stretched his great bow and shot terrific sharp-pointed shafts at the Rākshasas. And even like thunder-bolt cleaving mighty mountains, those shafts furnished with peacock's plumes falling powerfully (upon the foe), rent the Rākshasas. And those foremost of Rākshasas, Bibhishana's followers, also, in the encounter discharged darts and scimitars and pattiças at heroic Rākshasas. And surrounded by those Rākshasas, Bibhishana, then in the midst of his followers, appeared like an elephant in the midst of young ones. Then inciting the monkeys, whose dear object was to slay Rāvana, that one versed in time, the foremost of Rākshasas, spoke seasonably thus,—\"This one that stayeth (in the field) is the sole and mighty support of the Rākshasa-chief; and this is his remaining force. Why then do the monkey-chiefs remain inactive? On this wicked Rākshasa being slain on the edge of battle, the remnant of his army, with the single exception of Rāvana, is destroyed. That hero—Prahasta—hath been slain, and Nikumbha possessed of wondrous strength, and Kumbhakarna, and Kumbha, and the night-ranger Dhumrāksha, and Jāmvumāli, and Mahāmāli, and Tikshnavega and Hemaprabha, and Suptaghna, and Jajnakopa, and the Rākshasa Vajradanstra, Sankrādi, and Vikata, and Arighna, and Tapana, and Manda, and Praghasa, and Prajangha, and Jangha, and Agniketu, and Durdharsha, and the powerful Raçmiketus and Viddujjibha, and Dwijibha, and the Rākshasa—Suryyaçatru, and Akampana, and Suparçwa, and the Rākshasas—Chakramāli, and Kampana and Satwavanta, and Devāntaka and Narāntaka.—Having slain these many powerful Rākshasas endowed with excess of might,—having crossed the sea with your arms, do ye cross this foot print of a cow. This is the remaining force which you monkeys must conquer; all those Rākshasas, that had come forward, elated with the pride of strength, have all been slain. It is not meet for me to slay the son of my brother, yet, casting off compassion will I for Rāma slay him.359 Tears surcharge the eyes of me who seeketh to slay him. Let therefore Lakshmana administer him his quietus. Ye monkeys, do ye in a body (first) slaughter those that are beside him (Indrajit.)\" Thus exhorted by that illustrious Rākshasa, the monkey-chiefs were exhilarated and began to flourish their tails. And then those mighty monkeys roared again and again, and sent up various shouts, even as peacocks cry on seeing clouds. And then Jāmbavān surrounded by his own forces, assailed the Rākshasas with rocks and with their nails and teeth. Thereat Rākshasas, endowed with exceeding strength, equipped with various weapons reproaching the lord of bears, as he was engaged in smiting (the foe),—and renouncing fear, with shafts and sharp axes and pattiças and yashtis, and tomaras, in the encounter assailed Jāmbavān, who was engaged in beating the Rākshasa forces. And that conflict between the monkeys and the Rakshas, waxed furious, like unto the tumultuous encounter of the immortals and the Asuras fired with wrath. And the magnanimous Hanumān incapable of being approached growing wroth,—uprooting a mountain, and putting down Lakshmana from his back, began a great carnage among the Rākshasas by thousands. And fighting a furious fight with his uncle, the powerful Indrajit—slayer of hostile heroes—again rushed against Lakshmana. And then there took place an encounter between those heroes in the field,—Lakshmana and the Rākshasa—discharging vollies of shafts and smiting each other; and those mighty and impetuous ones repeatedly covered each other with networks of arrows; like unto the sun and the moon covered by clouds at the expiration of Summer. And on account of their light-handedness, neither discharge of arrows, nor the drawing of the bow; nor the setting of the shaft on the bow-string; nor the taking of the bow; nor the selection of shafts; nor the clenching fast of their fists; nor the hitting of aims,—could be perceived as they fought on. And in consequence of the sky being covered with networks of arrows all around, discharged powerfully from their bows, the forms (of objects) could not be discovered. And Lakshmana having at Rāvana's son, and Rāvana's son having at Lakshmana, critical was the huggermugger that ensued360 in the encounter between each other. And they both kept ceaselessly showering feathered and sharpened shafts, the firmament was engulphed with a deep darkness. And in consequence of countless keen arrows alighting in hundreds, all sides and all the cardinal quarters were swarming with shafts. And all being over-spread with gloom, a mighty fright took possession (of creatures) when the Sun having ascended the setting-hill, and darkness environing all objects. And that day361 mighty torrents of blood flowed in thousands of streams; and fierce beasts of prey set up terrific yells (all around). And at that hour the wind did not blow, and fire did not blaze; and the Maharshis said,—'Fair befell creatures.' And the Gandharvas along with the Chāranas grew exceedingly agitated. Then Sumitrā's son pierced the four black steeds of the leonine Rākshasa, caparisoned in gold. And then he hit at (Indrajit's) charioteer with another yellow and sharpened javelin splendid, furnished with feathers; and resembling the thunder-bolt of the great Indra. And through his fleet handedness the graceful son of Raghu with the thunder-bolt of his shaft, resonant with the sound of his palm, separated the (charioteer's head) from his trunk. And on his charioteer having been slain the exceedingly energetic son of Mandodari, himself began to perform the function of a charioteer, and took up his bow. And this in the encounter was wonderful to behold. And then as (Indrajit) was eagerly engaged in managing the steeds, (Lakshmana) pierced him with sharpened shafts; and when (Indrajit) was eagerly wielding his bow, (Lakshmana) discharged shafts at his steeds. And on his steeds having been torn with shafts, Sumitrā's—foremost of fleet-handed—in the encounter assailed (Indrajit) doubtlessly ranging the field. Seeing his charioteer slain in the contest, Rāvana's son forewent his martial ardour, and was cast down. And seeing the Rākshasa with his face fallen, the leaders of monkey-bands, were exceedingly delighted and rendered homage unto Lakshmana. And then those monkey-chiefs—Pramāthi, Rabhasa, Sarabha and Gandamādana, not brooking (their foe) summoned their impetuosity. And suddenly springing up, those highly powerful monkeys endowed with terrific prowess descended upon those four best of steeds. And on those chargers being assailed by those monkeys resembling mountains, blood gushed out of their mouths. And then the steeds were smashed and sent to the ground. And having slain the steeds, and smitten the mighty car-warrior362 again by a vehement bound, came to the side of Lakshmana. And springing down from his car whose steeds had been slain, Rāvana's son, his charioteer having been pounded, charged the son of Sumitrā with arrows. And then Lakshmana resembling the great Indra, on (Indrajit's) best of chargers having been despatched, in the encounter began to terribly rive with arrows discharged (his foe) footing on the earth and showering excellent sharpened shafts."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Having his steeds slain, the night-ranger—Indrajit, standing on the ground, waxing fiercely angered, flamed up in energy. And armed with bows, they, desirous of slaying each other with shafts resembled an elephant and a bull in a forest, came out for securing victory in encounter. And slaughtering owe another, the Rākshasas and the wood-rangers, rushing this way and that, did not (for a moment) leave their lords. Then Rāvana's son, gladdening all the Rākshasas, and himself feeling cheered, addressed them in words of praise, saying,—\"All sides are entirely enveloped in this gloom,—so that, O foremost of Rākshasas, here we do not know who belongeth onto us and who not.—Do ye fight fearlessly for stupifying the monkeys; and I too, mounted on a car, shall come hither into the conflict. Do ye so act that the high-souled rangers of the woods may not attack me as I enter the city\". Saying this, that slayer of foes—Rāvana's son, deceiving the wood-rangers, entered the city of Lankā for providing himself with a (fresh) car. And embellishing a chariot, graceful and adorned with gold, furnished with prāças and swords and arrows, yoked with superb steeds, and driven by a charioteer, knowing horses and possessed of instructions (anent his art),—that victor in battle—the exceedingly energetic son of Rāvana—ascended it. And that hero, Mandodari's son, urged on by the force of the Finisher, went out of the city, surrounded by the foremost Rākshasas; and drawn by fast-speeding steeds, he presented himself before Lakshmana along with Bibhishana. And seeing Rāvana's son seated on the car, the son of Sumitrā and the exceedingly powerful monkeys and the Rākshasa—Bibhishana-—were highly amazed at the lighthandedness of that intelligent one. And Rāvana's son, waxing furious, in that contest began to bring down monkeys by hundreds and by thousands. And that victor in battle—Rāvana's son—fired with wrath, summoning all his celerity, slaughtered monkeys, drawing his bow into a circle. And slaughtered by nārāchas of terrific impetuosity, the monkeys saught the shelter of Sumitrā's son, like creatures seeking the refuge of their Lord. Then the son of Raghu, flaming up in martial wrath, severed his363 bow, displaying his fleethandedness. Thereat, taking another bow, (Indrajit) hurriedly fastened the string to it. And this bow also did Lakshmana cut off by means of a brace of arrows. And when (Indrajit) had his bow severed, Sumitrā's son pierced the son of Rāvana with five shafts resembling the venom of a poisonous serpent. And the shafts discharged from his364 mighty bow, piercing his365 person, dropped to the earth like unto powerful red serpents. And having his bow cut off, Rāvana's son, vomitting blood by his mouth, took up a superior bow powerful to a degree and having a stout string. And then aiming at Lakshmana, he, summoning his utmost celerity, showered arrows, as showereth Purandara in the season of rains. Thereat Lakshmana, subduer of enemies, retaining his calmness, resisted that powerful arrowy shower shot by Indrajit. And then that exceedingly energetic one, Raghu's son, possessing himself in calmness, displayed (his prowess) unto the son of Rāvana; and this was wonderful (to behold). And then displaying his lightness in the use of weapons, Lakshmana, growing furious, pierced the Rākshasas with three arrows each in that mighty encounter; and the lord of Rākshasas struck him with showers of shafts. And pierced sore by that powerful enemy—slayer of foes—he incessantly sent innumerable arrows after Lakshmana. And ere they reached their destination, that slayer of hostile heroes severed them with whetted arrows; and in the encounter that righteous one and foremost of car-warriors with a dart having bent joints, cut off the head of his charioteer mounted on the car. And deprived of their driver, there the steeds, retaining their calmness, began to go in rounds,—and this was wonderful Then Sumitrā's son of steady prowess, fired with anger, in that contest, frightening all, pierced his horses with arrows. And not brooking that act (of his adversary), Rāvana's son in the encounter pierced with ten shafts Sumitrā's son capable of making people's down stand on end. And his shafts resembling thunderbolts, and like unto all varieties of venom, touching (Lakshmana's) mail having a golden splendour, were reduced to naught. Thereat considering Lakshmana as clad in an impenetrable armour, Rāvana's son—Indrajit—growing furiously enraged, displaying his lighthandedness in arms, pierced Lakshmana in the temples with three well-knobbed shafts. And with those arrows lodged in his temples, Raghu's son, delighting in battle, appeared beautiful in the field like a mountain furnished with three summits. Albeit thus smitten in the contest by the Raksha with shafts, Lakshmana swiftly smote him in turn with five arrows; and in the encounter Lakshmana drawing his bow, pierced with shafts Indrajit's face graced with elegant ear-rings. And those heroes—Lakshmana and Indrajit—equipped with exceedingly powerful bows, and endowed with heroism and dreadful prowess, wounded each other with sharp arrows. And both Lakshmana and Indrajit, with their persons bathed in blood in that encounter, appeared like unto flowering Kinçukas. And approaching each other, those bowmen, each telling his heart on victory, wounded each other all over the body with terrific shafts. Then Rāvana's son, carried away by martial rage, pierced Bibhishana in his handsome face With three arrows. And piercing the lord of Rākshasas, Bibhishana, he with three iron-headed arrows, pierced the monkey-leaders each with a shaft. Thereat, enraged at him more furiously than ever, the exceedingly energetic Bibhishana with his mace despatched the steeds of the wicked-minded son of Rāvana. Then jumping down from his chariot with its horses slain, (Indrajit), endowed with great energy, who had his charioteer pounded, discharged a dart at his uncle. And seeing it descend, the enhancer of Sumitrā's joy severed the same with whetted arrows and brought it down in ten fragments to the ground. And Bibhishana of a tough bow, growing enraged, discharged at (Indrajit), who had his steeds slain, five speeding shafts having the touch of the thunder-bolt.—And those arrows furnished with gold at the feathered parts, riving his person, were bathed in blood, and resembled mighty red serpents. Thereat wroth with his uncle, Indrajit took op an excellent shaft—bestowed on him by Yama himself—endowed with terrific force,—the flower of shafts among all the Rakshas. And seeing that mighty shaft set by him (on the bow-string), the highly powerful Lakshmana, possessed of dreadful prowess, (in his turn) took up another arrow, bestowed by Kuvera himself of immeasurable soul in a dream,—unconquerable, and incapable of being borne even by the celestials and Asuras with Indra at their head. And on their best of bows being powerfully drawn with their arms resembling bludgeons, they set up cries like unto Kraunchas. And on those foremost of shafts set on those excellent bows of those heroes, being drawn, flamed up in exceeding splendour. And those flaming arrows, discharged from the bows, illumining the welkin, with vehemence struck at each other's head. And a concussion took place of those arrows of terrific aspects; and a furious fire sprang up thereat, with embers shooting around. And dashing against each other like unto mighty planets, they, reduced to an hundred shivers in the encounter, saught the earth. Seeing their shafts baffled, Indrajit and Lakshmana, staying on the edge of the battle, were seized with shame and wrath. Thereat Sumitrā's son, flying into a fury, took up a Vāruna weapon. And the conquerer of the great Indra intent on battle, in the encounter discharged a terrific Raudra weapon; and the exceedingly wonderful Vāruna weapon was baffled by him. Then, waxing wroth, that victor in battle—the wondrous energetic Indrajit—as if annihilating the world, discharged a flaming Agneya weapon. And the heroic Lakshmma resisted it with a Solar weapon. Seeing his weapon resisted, Rāvana's son, transported with passion, took up an Asura arrow, capable of rending foes. And from that weapon issued daggers and clubs and darts and bhuçundis and maces and swords and axes.366 And in the conflict, seeing that dire and dreadful weapon, irrisistible to all creatures and capable of riving all arms, the effulgent Lakshmana baffled it with a Māheçwara367 weapon. And the encounter that took place between them was wonderful and capable of making people's down stand on end. And beings stationed in the sky surrounded Lakshmana on all sides. And in that terrific encounter of the monkeys and the Rākshasas resounding with dreadful roars, the welkin was covered with innumerable beings seized with wonderment. And saints and Pitris and deities and Gandharbas and birds and serpents, placing Satakratu in their front, protected Lakshmana in the conflict. And then that hero, Rāghava's younger brother, fixed (on his bow) another superior shaft, having the feel of fire itself, and capable of riving the son of Rāvana; furnished with fair feathers; tapering; having elegant joints; symmetrical; and plated with gold,—an arrow capable of finishing the body; irrisistible; dreadful; terrific unto Rākshasas; resembling the venom of poisonous serpents; and worshipped by the celestial hosts; by which the exceedingly energetic and wonderful Lord riding the horse368—Sakra—of old in the war between the celestials and the Asuras had defeated the Dānavas. And Sumitrā's son, Lakshmana; graced with auspiciousness, drawing on his best of bows that foremost of shafts—the Aindra weapon—invincible in conflict, spoke these words, tending to bring about his success,369—\"If Daçaratha's son—Rāma—is righteous and truthful, and if in prowess he hath no rival, then slay this son of Rāvana\". Saying this, the heroic Lakshmana in that conflict, drawing the straight-speeding arrow up to his ear,370 discharged it at Indrajit. And shooting the Aindra weapon, that destroyer of hostile heroes—Lakshmana—severing from its trunk the head of Indrajit with its corslet, graced with burning ear-rings, brought it down to the ground. And the mighty severed head of the Rākshasa's son, resembling one made of gold, was seen covered with blood. And slain, Rāvana's son dropped to the earth, with his armour and corslet on, and his bow fallen (from his grasp). And then all the monkeys with Bibhishana set up cheers, even as the immortals cheered at the destruction of Vritra. And in the sky there arose the victorious shouts of all beings and high souled saints, and also of Gandharbas and Apsarās. And knowing (Indrajit) fallen (in fight), the mighty army of Rākshasas; attacked by monkeys burning for victory, fled in the ten cardinal directions. And assailed by the monkeys, the Rākshasas, pursued (by their foes), with their senses lost, rushed towards Lankā, leaving their arms behind. And overwhelmed with fright, Rākshasas fled in an hundred directions, all renouncing their arms—bearded darts, and swords, and axes. And harassed by the monkeys, some hurriedly entered Lankā, and some plunged into the sea, and some saught shelter in the mountains. And seeing Indrajit slain and lying down on the field of battle, thousands of Rākshasas fled away. As when the Sun sets, his rays remain no longer, on that Rākshasa having fallen, the Rākshasas dispersed in the ten cardinal quarters, like unto the Sun when his rays have been rendered mild, or fire which hath been extinguished. And the mighty-armed (Indrajit) was utterly reft of life. And on the son of the Rākshasa-chief falling, the world, having its foe slain, with its huge affliction gone off, experienced the bright of joy. And on that unrighteous Rākshasa having been slain, the reverend Sakra together with the Maharshis was filled with delight. And sounds of kettle-drums were heard in the sky proceeding from the celestials. And blossoms were showered by dancing Apsarās and high-souled Gandharbas. And this was wonderful (to behold.) And on that Rākshasa of fell deeds having been slain, the dust was laid, the water became transparent, the sky looked bright, and the deities and Dānavas were filled with rejoicings. And on that Dread of all creatures having been slain, the gods, Gandharbas and Dānavas, assembled together in joy, said,—\"Now let the Brahmanas who have their sins removed, with their anxiety gone off, range about\". And then the monkey-leaders, seeing that foremost of Nairitas of unparalleled prowess slain in battle, began to gladly pay homage (unto Lakshmana). And Bibhishana and Hanumān and Jāmbavān—leader of bears—saluted and hymned Lakshmana on the score of his victory. And shouting and bounding and roaring, the monkeys at this hour of high joy stood surrounding Raghu's son.371 And flourishing their tails and striking the earth (with them), the monkeys shouted,—'Victory unto Lakshmana!' And embracing each other, the monkeys with delighted spirits began to converse in various ways touching Rāghava's welfare. And beholding that deed, difficult of being done, performed by their beloved friend—Lakshmana—and hearing their foe—Indrajit—slain (in battle), the celestials attained the summit of joy."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Having in the conflict slain that conquerer of enemies, Lakshmana graced with auspicious marks, with his body bathed in blood, experienced delight. And then supporting himself on Bibhishana and Hanumān, the exceedingly powerful Lakshmana endowed with prowess, taking Jāmbavān, Hanumān and all the monkeys with him, speedily went to the place where Sugriva and Rāghava were. And then going round Rāma and saluted him, Sumitrā's son stood before his brother, like Indra's brother staying before Sakra. And approaching with a look which of itself was significant,372 the heroic Bibhishana described unto the high-souled Rāghava the dreadful destruction of Indrajit. And then the delighted Bibhishana related unto Rāma how the high-souled Lakshmana had cut off the head of Rāvana's son. And as soon as that exceedingly powerful one heard of the destruction of Indrajit by Lakshmana, he experienced a huge accession of joy, and thus delivered himself,—\"Excellent, O Lakshmana! Pleased am I (with thee). Thou hast performed a difficult feat. The son of Rāvana having been slain, know for certain that we have been victorious\". And then smelling the head of the bashful Lakshmana, enhancer of fame, (Rāma) endowed with prowess, from affection forcibly hugged him into his lap. And making him seat on his lap, and overpowering him with embraces,373 (Rāma) again and again tenderly eyed his brother, Lakshmana. And moved with grief, that best of persons, Rāma, smelling the head of Lakshmana, wounded with darts and having his person pierced (with arms), sighing and breathing hard—and nursing his body with his hand, addressed Lakshmana, soothing him,—'To-day his son having been slain, I deem Rāvana himself as slain in fight. On that wicked-minded enemy of mine having been destroyed, I am victorious (in encounter). By luck, O hero, hast thou in conflict severed the right arm of the fell Rāvana. Verily he (Indrajit) was his stay. Both Bibhishana and Hanumān have done mighty deeds in battle. In three days and nights, (my enemy) hath been brought down. To-day have I been made foeless. Now Rāvana will for certain march forth,—backed by a mighty phalanx. Rāvana will for certain sally out, hearing his son brought down. That unconquerable lord of Rākshasas, aggrieved for the destruction of his son, marching out,—shall I slay, environed with a mighty force. O Lakshmana, the conqueror of Sakra having in battle been slain by thee—who art my lord—Sitā and the (entire) earth are not incapable of being obtained by me\". Having thus soothed and embraced his brother, Raghu's son—Rāma—highly rejoiced, calling Sushena, said,—\"Do thou so act that this highly wise son of Sumitrā, devoted to his friends, may be healed and be eased. Do thou without delay heal Sumitrā's son, attached to his friends, of his wounds. And do thou also carefully relieve all those heroes in the army of bears and monkeys fighting with trees,—as well as others, who have been wounded and have got sores (in consequence)\". Thus addressed by Rāma, the high-souled monkey-leader administered a potent medicine to the nose of Lakshmana. And smelling the same, he got healed; he was relieved of his pain and his outgoing vitality was shut up. And at the mandate of Rāghava he likewise treated his friends headed by Bibhishana and all the principal monkeys. And restored to his natural condition, Sumitrā's son, healed, and with his exhaustion removed, and his suffering gone off in a moment, experienced exhilaration of spirits. And Rāma and the monkey-king and Bibhishana and the powerful lord of bears along with their hosts, seeing Sumitrā's son risen hale, rejoiced greatly in delight. And the high-souled son of Daçaratha honored exceedingly that exceedingly hard feat of Lakshamana; and the monkey-king, hearing that the conquerer of Sakra had fallen in fight, was filled with joy."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "When the counsellors of Pulastya's son, hearing of Indrajit having been slain, speedily conveyed the tidings unto the Ten-necked one, who was ignorant374 of the same. \"O mighty monarch, in our very sight thy exceedingly effulgent son hath been slain by Lakshmana with the help of Bibhishana. And that hero confronted by the (other) hero, hath been vanquished in fight. And the hero, thy son, the conquerer of the celestial chief, hath also been slain by Lakshmana. And having gratified Lakshmana with his shafts, he hath repaired to the supreme regions\". Hearing of that mighty terror, viz., the rueful and dreadful destruction of his son, Indrajit, in battle, he straightway swooned away. Then regaining his consciousness after a long while, that foremost of Rākshasas—the king—overwhelmed with grief for his son, and distressed, burst into lamentations, with his senses wildered,—thus,—\"O foremost in the Rākshasa army! O my child endowed with high might! Having conquered Indra himself, wherefore to-day hast thou come under the sway of Lakshmana? Doubtless, thou enraged could pierce with thy arrows the Destroyer of Time himself, and the summit of Mandāra,—what shall I say of Lakshmana in encounter? To-day king Viwaçwata hath raised himself immensely in my estimation, for to-day he, O mighty-armed one, hath brought thee under the law of Time. But this is the way of capable warriors as well as celestials. He that layeth down his life for his lord, repaireth to heaven. To-day seeing Indrajit slain, the deities and the guardians of the worlds, and the mighty saints, their fear gone off, shall sleep peacefully. This triple world and this entire earth with her woods, reft of one—Indrajit—appear to me as vacant. To-day shall I hear the cries of the daughters of the Nairitas in my inner apartment, like unto the roars of she-elephants in a mountain-cavern. Renouncing thy state of an heir-apparent, and Lankā and the Rakshas, O subduer of enemies, and thy mother, and me, and thy wife—whither hast thou gone, (leaving) us all? O hero, I having gone to the region of Yama, thou ought to have performed my last rites, but thou standest in a relation the very reverse of this.375 And Sugriva living and Lakshmana and Rāghava, without extracting my dart, whither hast thou gone, leaving us all? And then vising from the disaster that had befallen his son, a mighty wrath overcame the lord of Rākshasas—Rāvana, as he was thus indulging in lamentations. And even as in summer, the (Solar) rays flame up the Sun, the destruction of his son flamed up all the fiercer, him, who was naturally irascible. And as he kept yawning in passion, a flaming fire with smoke darted from his mouth, even as it did from the mouth of Vritra. And burning in grief for the destruction of his son, and coming under masterdom of passion, that hero—Rāvana—reflecting (awhile) in his mind, resolved upon slaying Vaidehi. And naturally red, and reddened (still more) by the fire of wrath, Rāvana's glowing eyes were dreadful (to behold). And his form, terrific by nature, in consequence of the fire of his wrath having possessed it entirely, resembled the form of the enraged Rudra. And from the eyes of that infuriated one fell drops of tears as drop from a flaming lamp drops of burning oil. And as he grinded his teeth, the gnashing resembled the sounds sent by the machine376 drawn by the Dānavas and churning the deep. The Rākshasas durst not approach that one eying round and resembling the Destroyer himself, intent, on devouring both mobile and immobile. Then exceedingly enraged, Rāvana—lord of Rākshasas—spoke in the midst of the Rākshasas, inciting them to battle,—\"I practised severe austerities for thousands of years; and gratified the Self-sprung at times. Neither from Asuras nor from celestials can any fear spring to me. My mail conferred on me by Brahmā, which in effulgence resembles the Sun himself, was not broken by blows like unto thunder-bolt at the war between the deities and demons. To-day who will come forward against me in battle accoutred in that and mounted on a car in the conflict? Not even Purandara himself. Do ye, beating hundreds of drums, to-day raise that mighty and dreadful bow of mine which, with arrows, had been bestowed on one by the gratified Self-sprung at the war of the gods and Asuras,—so that I may therewith compass the destruction of Rāma and Lakshmana in mighty battle\". Burning (in grief) for the destruction of his son, the fell Rāvana, coming under the influence of anger, reflecting (in his mind), resolved to slay Sitā. And eying round, that copper-eyed and dreadful one of a terrific aspect, distressed, in a piteous voice addressed all the night-rangers, saying,—\"By his power of illusion, my beloved child, for deceiving the wood-rangers, slaying something (else), had shown it unto them as Sitā. Now will I do that good office myself,—Vaidehi will I slay—even her that is devoted to that friend of Kshatriyas\". Having spoken thus unto his counsellors, he swiftly took up a sword; and raising it, of excellent temper and of cerulean hue, he rushed out vehemently, surrounded by his wives and counsellors. From grief for his son. Rāvana with his consciousness wildered, taking up a sword, in rage, rushed towards the place where Mithilā's daughter was. Seeing the Rākshasa rising on, some, emitted leonine roars, and seeing the Rākshasa enraged, embracing each other, said,—\"To-day those two brothers, seeing this one, will be exceedingly pained. By this one, influenced with passion were the four guardians of the worlds conquered; and many other foes were brought down in battle. Procuring gems from the three worlds, Rāvana enjoyeth them. Neither in strength nor in prowess is there any one on earth who is his compeer\". As they were speaking thus, Rāvana, reft of his senses by wrath, rushed against Vaidehi, who had taken up her abode in the Açoka wood. And dissuaded by his friends endowed with good intelligence, he, wrought up with high wrath, darted (against Sitā), even as an enraged planet377 rusheth against Rohini378 in the firmament. And the blameless daughter of Mithila protected by the Rākshasis, saw the infuriated Rāvana bearing that best of blades in his hand. Seeing (Rāvana) approach, sword in hand, despite the earnest entreaties of his friends, Janaka's daughter, Sitā, pained and overcome by grief, said, weeping,—\"From the way in which, wrought up with wrath, this wicked-minded one is rushing on at me personally, it appears that he will slay me, who have a lord, as one who hath not. He did urge me much ever devoted to my lord, saying 'Be thou my wife but forsooth I disregarded him. And plainly in consequence of my refusal, he hath given way to despair. And overcome by anger and passion, he is ready to slay me. Or it may be that to-day for me those foremost of men, the brothers—Rāma and Lakshmana—have been slain in encounter by this inglorious one. I heard a furious and fearful uproar raised by countless Rākshasas rejoicing, and expressing their delight.—Alas! O fie! For me those princes have met with destruction. Or it may be that not without slaying Rāma and Lakshmana, this terrific Rākshasa, having his heart set on sin, from grief for his son, will slay me. Fool that I am, I did not then act agreeably to Hanumān's words. If I had gone away seated on his back, without waiting for the victory (of my lord), I devoted to him, placed on his lap, should not have come by this repentance. When Kauçalyā, having an only son, will hear of her son slain in battle, I fancy, her heart shall burst. And, weeping, she will remember that high-souled one's birth and boyhood, and youth and pious acts and loveliness. And that one bereft of her consciousness, filled with despair, after having performed his srāddha379 will doubtless enter into fire or water. Shame on the unchaste and hump-backed Mantharā, having her heart fixed in sin, for whose sake this grief shall exercise Kauçalyā!\" Seeing the distressed daughter of Mithilā lament thus, like unto Rohini come under the sway of a planet in the absence of the Moon, in the meanwhile his380 pure and good courtier, named Suparçwa, endowed with intelligence, albeit prevented by other courtiers, spoke unto Rāvana, foremost of Rākshasas,—\"Wherefore, O Ten-necked one, O thou who art the very younger brother of Vaiçravana himself, Dost thou desire to slay Vaidehi, forsaking righteousness? Why, O hero! O lord of Rākshasas! having led the Brahmacharyya mode of life, studied the Vedas, and returned from the house of thy spiritual guide, and ever engaged in religious acts, to-day dost thou intend to slay a woman? Do thou, O king, now stay expecting Mithilā's daughter381 endowed with loveliness; and do thou along with us vent thy wrath on him.382 To-day being the fourteenth day of the dark fortnight, do thou this very day prepare for conflict; at amāvasyā,383 environed with thy forces, do thou march for victory. Heroic, and intelligent, a mighty car-warrior and swordsman, thou, mounted on a car, slaying the redoubtable son of Daçaratha, wilt obtain Mithilā's daughter\". Thus exhorted by his friend, the unrighteous Rāvana accepted his virtuous speech; and then that powerful one went (back) to his house, and, surrounded by his friends, entered the court."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Entering his court, the king, distressed, and exceedingly aggrieved, sat him down on the foremost seat sighing like an enraged lion. And stricken with grief in consequence of his son's death, that highly powerful Rāvana, with folded hands, addressed all the heroic Rākshasas, saying:—\"Do ye all proceed to battle with elephants, horses and cars. And encircling Rāma only and discharging shafts at him, delightedly, like unto clouds, in the rainy season, pouring water, do ye slay him. Or I shall slay him to-morrow in the presence of all, wounded by you in the mighty encounter with sharpened arrows\". Hearing the speech of their lord the Rākshasas, with a huge army and a host of cars, speedily issued out for battle. And they all threw at the monkeys life-destroying Parighas, Pattiças, arrows, daggers and Paraskwadhas. And the monkeys too threw crags and trees at the Rākshasas. Thus on the eve of sun set there arose a terrible conflict between the Rākshasas and the monkeys. And they struck each other in the conflict with clubs, chitras, Prasas, daggers and Paraskwadhas. The conflict being thus carried on, there arose a mighty dust which was again destroyed by the current of blood gushing out of the persons of the Rākshasas and the monkeys. Elephants and cars were like the banks of that river of blood, the arrows were like the fishes, and the flags were the trees on their banks and the corpses were like planks afloat there. Being thus wounded and assailed by the Rākshasas, those heroic monkeys leaped and broke down the flags, armours, cars, horses and other weapons. And with their sharp teeth and nails they scratched the hair, ears, foreheads and the noses of the Rākshasas. Like unto vultures falling upon a felled tree, hundreds of monkeys fell upon one Rākshasa in that encounter. And the Rākshasas resembling mountains, with huge clubs, prāsas, daggers and parāshwadhas, struck the monkeys (in their turn). Being thus assailed by the Rākshasas, the mighty host of monkeys took refuge of Rāma, the son of Daçaratha, the worthy refuge of all creatures. Thereupon the highly effulgent and powerful Rāma, taking up his bow, entered the Rākshasa host and began to make a downpour of arrows. And Rāma entering the field, those terrible Rākshasas, being burnt with the fire of his arrows, could not stand before him like unto clouds disappearing before the Sun in the welkin. And the night-rangers only espied the dreadful feats performed by Rāma and which were above the power of others. Except when guiding the huge army or driving the cars they could not see Rāma like unto the wind invisible in a forest. They all beheld the Rākshasa force scattered, wounded, burnt down with arrows, broken and assailed with weapons, by Rāma, but none could see the quick-moving Rāma. As people cannot see the soul which governs all objects of sense so they could not see Rāma, who was thus inflicting wounds on them. \"It is he who is destroying the soldiers riding the elephants, it is he who is breaking down the mighty cars, and it is he who with sharp arrows is slaying the cavalry—rider and horse\". Thus saying those Rākshasas, in that conflict and in the very presence of Rāma, highly enraged, began to slay each other. They were all bewildered by the huge Gandharba weapon discharged by the high-souled Rāma and so they could not see Rāma, who was thus burning down their force. And the Rākshasas sometimes beheld thousands of Rāma in the battle field and again saw one Rāma only. They at times saw the quick-moving golden end of the bow of that high-souled one, resembling a circular fire brand but they did not behold Rāghava. And he looked like kāla chakra, having his middle body as its navel, his own strength as its lustre, the arrow for its radius or spoke, the bow for the circumference, the twang of the bow for its sound, his power and intelligence for its brightness, and the aim of the celestial weapons for its limit. And in the eighth division of the time by Rāma alone with arrows resembling the flame of fire were destroyed ten thousands swift-coursing cars, eighteen thousand elephants fourteen thousands horses and riders and two million Rākshasa infantry assuming shapes at will. And those night-rangers, who were still left, having their horses killed, cars and flags broken, fled in fear of life to the city of Lankā. And the battle field, filled with slain horses elephants and infantry, looked like the high-souled and enraged Rudra's arena of sports. Thereupon the celestials with Gandharbas, Siddhas and the great ascetics glorified the wonderful feat of Rāma. And the virtuous-souled Rāma addressed Sugriva, Bibhishana the monkey Hanumān, the leading monkey Jāmbavān, Mainda and Divida who were near him, saying—\"This is the power of my weapons and as well as that of Rudra\". The high-souled Rāma, equalling Sakra in prowess, thus slaying the huge host of the lord of Rākshasas and assailing them with shafts and weapons—the celestials, delighted, sang his praises."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "By Rāma, of unwearied actions, with flaming arrows feathered in burning gold, were destroyed thousands of elephants—many horses with their riders, many a car crested with flaming banners; thousands of heroic Rākshasas assuming shapes at will, engaged by Rāvana, and armed with clubs and parighās; and golden pennons. Beholding and hearing of this the remaining night-rangers assembled and were greatly bewildered, poorly and stricken with anxiety. The widows and those who had lost their children or kinsmen approached those Rākshasas and overwhelmed with grief, bewailed piteously,—\"Alas! why did the aged and grim-visaged Surpanakhā, having her belly extending down-ward, behold in the forest Rāma graceful like Kandarpa. And beholding him of great beauty and prowess, ever engaged in the welfare of all creatures, that ugly one, worthy of being slain by people, was excited with lust. Why did that ugly-faced she-demon, devoid of all qualities, address Rāma, having a beautiful countenance, gifted with many virtues and great effulgence? Alas for the misfortune of the Rākshasas, the aged Rākshasee brought before him such a vile proposal, hated of all and worthy of creating laughter. For the destruction of Khara, Dushana and other Rākshasas that ugly one approached Rāghava with such a vile intention. It was for her that Rāvana created enmity (with Rāma) and Sitā was carried away by the Ten-necked Rākshasa. But he could not spread his influence upon Sitā the daughter of king Janaka and deep rooted and eternal became the enmity with the highly powerful Rāghava. And beholding the Rākshasa Birādha slain by Rāma alone—(Rāvana) wishing Vaidehi should have regarded that as a sufficient proof of his prowess. And fourteen thousand Rākshasas of terrible deeds were slain by him in Janasthāna with shafts resembling the flame of fire. Khara, Dushana as well as Triçirā were slain by him in conflict with arrows resembling the Sun—this was a sufficient proof (of his power). Yoyanabāhu and Kavandha, drinking blood, were slain by him, roaring with wrath—this too was a sufficient proof of his power. Rāma slew the powerful Vāli, the son of the thousand eyed one, resembling the cloud—that too was the sufficient proof of his prowess. By him Sugriva, poorly and living in the mount Rishyamukha, having all his desires frustrated, was placed on the throne—that too even was the sufficient proof of his power. He (Rāvana) from foolishness did not like the becoming speech of Bibhishana conducive to the acquirement of piety and wealth and securing the welfare of the Rākshasas. Had the younger brother of the lord of wealth (Rāvana) observed the words of Bibhishana, Lankā would not have been overwhelmed with grief and reduced to the state of a cremation ground. Hearing of the destruction of the highly powerful Kumbhakarna by Rāma. of the irrepressible Atikaya by Lakshmana as well as of his beloved son Indrajit, Rāvana did not come to his senses.384 There is audible in every house of the Rākshasas, the cry,—'My son, my brother, my husband is slain in battle.' In conflict have been destroyed by the heroic Rāma, thousand cars, horses, serpents and infantry. Perhaps Rudra, Vishnu, Mahendra or the performer of hundred sacrifices, or even Death, in the shape of Rāma, is slaying us. By Rāma all the heroes have been slain—despair has taken possession of our minds—we do not behold the end of our terror and are bewailing being deprived of our lords. Does not the Ten-necked hero, who has obtained boons (from Brahmā) perceive that a mighty disaster shall befall him from Rāma? Neither the celestials, Gandharbas, Piçachas nor Rākshasas shall be able to save him from Rāma in conflict. In every battle many an accident befalls Rāvana—this bespeaks of his destruction at the hands of Rāma. The great Patriarch, being pleased, conferred upon Rāvana the boon that no fear would proceed unto him from the celestials, the Dānavas or the Rākshasas—but he did not beg of him, security from men. Forsooth, he is that fearful man who shall slay Rāvana and the Rākshasas. The celestials, being thus oppressed by Rāvana, who had obtained the boon, worshipped the great Patriarch with severe austerities. And being propitiated with them, the high-souled Patriarch, for their welfare, addressed the celestials, with the following pregnant speech. \"From to-day shall the Rākshasas and Dānavas roam for ever, afraid of the celestials\". Thereupon the celestials headed by Indra engaged in propitiating Mahādeva, the slayer of Tripura, and who rides upon a bull. And being pleased, Mahadeva addressed them, saying,—\"For your welfare there will be born a woman who shall be the cause of the destruction of the Rākshasas\". As hunger, being engaged by the celestials, did destroy in olden time, all the Dānavas, so shall she (Sitā) the root of the extinction of Rākshasa race destroy us all with Rāvana. Alas! for the foolishness of the vicious-minded and insolent Rāvana destruction has faced us and we are overwhelmed with grief. We do not see any such being in the world who can afford us shelter. Rāghava has attacked us like unto the fire of dissolution. There is no refuge for us who have been stricken with fear as no help reaches the elephants in a forest beset with fire. The high-souled Bibhishana did the just thing in proper time—he took shelter of him from whom he expected danger\". Thus bewailed piteously and loudly—the she-demons holding each other by the neck and being stricken with fear and grief."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Whereupon Rāvana heard in every house of Lankā the piteous cries of the she-demons possessed by sorrow. And sighing hard he engaged in meditation for some time. And terrible-looking as he was, Rāvana was greatly worked up with ire. Having his eyes reddened with anger, and gnashing his teeth and biting the lips, that one, irrepressible by other Rākshasas, looked like the fire of dissolution incarnate. Thereupon the lord of Rākshasas in anger as if burning down everything with his look, addressed the Rakshas who were near him—Mahodara, Mahāpārsha, Birupāksha—\"Do ye speedily speak to the soldiers that they should sally out for battle at my command. Hearing his speech—those Rakshas, possessed by fear, asked by the command of the king, the Rākshasa soldiers to be ready. And thereat all those grim-visaged Rākshasas saying 'so be it' and performing benedictory ceremonies proceeded to the battle-field. And those mighty car-warriors, worshipping Rāvana, and desiring the victory of their lord, stood before them with folded hands. Thereupon Rāvana, beside himself with anger, laughing, adddressed those Rākshasas, Mahodara, Mahāpārsha, and Birupāksha, saying—\"To-day shall I despatch both Rāma and Lakshmana to the abode of Death with arrows resembling the sun at the time of dissolution, discharged off my bow. And slaying the enemies I shall repair the loss of Khara, Kumbhakarna, Prahasta and Indrajit. The atmosphere, the quarters the sky and the deep being enveloped with the cloud of arrows shall become invisible. I shall slay to-day all the heroic monkeys with my winged arrows. Ascending my car gifted with the velocity of the wind shall I churn to day the monkey host with arrow-like waves coming from the ocean-like bow. I shall like an elephant distress to-day the monkey-like pools having their countenances for the blown lotuses, and the lustre of their bodies for the filaments. To-day in the encounter, the leaders of the monkey hosts, with their heads transfixed with arrows, shall cover the earth, like unto lotuses with their stalks. I shall to-day with a single arrow, cleave hundreds of heroic monkeys fighting with trees in their hands. I shall wipe to-day the tears of those whose brother or son has been slain by destroying their foe. In the encounter to-day I shall, with the monkeys deprived of their breath and clept with my arrows, so cover the earth that it may not be seen by any. I shall satisfy to-day with the flesh of the enemies slain by my shafts, the crows, vultures and others who live upon flesh. Get ready soon my car and bring my bow. And let the remaining night-rangers follow me in battle\". Hearing his words Mahāpārsha addressed the leaders of the army who were near him, saying,—\"Get your soldiers ready\". And the commanders too quickly went round all the houses in Lankā and asked the Rākshasas to be ready soon. Thereupon began to issue out in a moment terrible-looking Rākshasas, emitting roars, having dreadful faces and with various weapons in their hands—daggers, Pattiças, maces, clubs, furrows, sharpened saktis, traps, various rods, sharpened chakra, parashwadhas, vindipalas, satāghnis and various other excellent weapons. Thereupon at the command of Rāvana the commanders brought one Nijuta (a hundred thousand) cars, three Nijuta elephants, sixty million horses, asses and camels and numberless infantry. They arranged the soldiers before the king and in the interval the charioteer brought the car—filled with excellent celestial weapons—richly adorned, containing many an armour, girt with a network of tinkling ornaments, crested with various jewels, having jewelled pillars and a thousand golden jars. Beholding the car the Rākshasas were greatly astonished. And Rāvana, the lord of Rākshasas, rising up all on a sudden, ascended that car, brilliant like the flaming fire and the aggregate rays of a million sun, quick-coursing, having a charioteer, drawn by eight horses, huge and shining in its native lustre. Thereupon proceeded Rāvana, encircled by many a Rākshasa as if rending the earth with the excess of his prowess. There arose a huge sound of bugles accompanied with that of Mridangas, drums, conchs, and kalāpas. The lord of the Rakshas—wicked, the slayer of the Brahmins—the thorn of the celestials, and who hath brought away Sitā by stealth, has come with his umbrellas and chowries to fight with the foremost of Raghus—this cry was heard everywhere. And with his tremendous roar the earth shook. And hearing all on a sudden that sound, the monkeys fled away in fear. And the highly effulgent Rāvana, having huge arms and surrounded by his ministers, came there being certain of gaining victory. Being commanded by Rāvana, Mahāpārsha, Mahodara and the irrepresible Birupāksha ascended the car. They, desirous of winning victory, issued out emitting dreadful roars in delight and as if rending the earth therewith. Thereupon the highly effulgent (Rāvana) resembling Death, with uplifted bow, sallied out for battle along with the army of Rakshas. And that mighty car-warrior, went out in his chariot drawn by quick-coursing steeds by that gate which led to where Rāma and Lakshmana were. Thereat the sun lost its brilliance—the quarters were enshrouded with darkness; the birds sent forth dreadful cries and the earth shook. The celestials poured down bloody rains—the course of the horses was slackened—the vultures sat on the banners and jackals emitted inauspicious cries, his left eye and the left arm began to shake—his countenance became pale and his voice grew harsher. The Ten-necked Rākshasa thus going out for battle there appeared many bad omens indicating his destruction. From the sky fell a fire-brand accompanied with the sound of thunder; vultures and crows emitted inauspicious cries. Disregarding these dreadful omens which appeared then, Rāvana, incited by death, foolishly went out to slay his (enemies). And by the wheel-sound of the chariots of the great Rākshasas the host of monkeys calling each other, excited with anger and willing to gain victory, addressed themselves for fight. Thereupon the Ten-necked one, enraged, with his arrows feathered in gold, made a dreadful slaughter of the army of monkeys. And some of those heroic monkeys were beheaded by Rāvana—some had their hearts rent and others were shorn of their ears. Some had their breath choked, some were killed and others had their sides broken. Some had their hands cut off and others had their eyes put out. And wherever in the encounter, the Ten-headed Rākshasa, whirling his eyes in ire, went in his car—the monkey leaders could not stand the vehemence of his arrows."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "There the earth was covered with monkeys whose bodies were rent with the arrows of the Ten-necked (Rāvana). As the flies cannot stand before the flaming fire so they could not bear the vehemence of Rāvana's shafts. Being thus assailed with pointed arrows they fled away crying, like unto elephants being burnt by fire. And Rāvana with his arrows pursued in conflict the course of clouds. Thus slaughtering the monkeys the lords of Rākshasas speedily reached in the encounter where Rāghava was. And beholding the monkeys assailed and afraid Sugriva placing Sushena in charge of a gulma385 addressed himself for the battle. And placing that heroic monkey, his equal in prowess, in that command Sugriva sallied out with a tree in his hand to meet the enemy. And followed him on all sides the leaders of the monkeys with huge crags and various trees. The heroic Sugriva emitted terrible roars in the conflict and assailed the heroic Rākshasas and many others. The huge-bodied monkey-chief crushed the Rākshasas like unto the wind uprooting the trees at the time of dissolution. He began to make a downpour of crags at the Rākshasa host like unto the cloud pouring down hailstorms at the birds in the forest. And being beheaded by the crags discharged by that monkey chief the Rākshasas fell down like unto mountains cleft. The Rākshasas being thus attacked and shattered by Sugriva and roaring and falling down on all sides, an irrepressible Rākshasa, skilled in archery, by name Birupāksha, pronouncing his own name, got down from the car and mounted an elephant. And mounted on the elephant that highly powerful Birupāksha sent forth leonine roars and dashed against the monkeys. Exciting the joy of the Rākshasas and removing their anxiety he discharged dreadful shafts at Sugriva and his army. And being assailed by the pointed arrows of that Rākshasa that lord of monkeys roared in anger and made up his mind to destroy him. Thereupon uprooting a tree the heroic monkey, skilled in warfare, leaped and struck that huge elephant down in his presence. And being assailed greatly by Sugriva that huge elephant proceeded a little within the range of the bow and roared and died. And being; greatly enraged on the destruction of that elephant the highly powerful Rākshasa dashed forward to face the enemy. That one of quick movements took up his dagger and armour and viling, approached Sugriva. And beholding his movement Sugriva took up a huge crag resembling a cloud and hurled it against Birupāksha. That highly powerful leading Rākshasa, finding the crag about to fall, turned a little away and struck the monkey with his dagger. And being assailed with dagger by that powerful Rākshasa the monkey remained senseless for sometime on the ground. And rising up all on a sudden he, clenching his fist, struck that Rākshasa in the mighty encounter on his breast and got him down. Being struck with the fist the night-ranger Birupāksha greatly enraged cut down with his dagger Sugriva's armour and tumbled him down with his feet. And the monkey rising up again was about to deal him a blow, hard as a thunder-bolt, with a dreadful sound. And receding a little, he baffled its aim and returned one on Sugriva's breast. Finding his aim baffled and himself struck in return by the Rākshasa, Sugriva, the lord of monkeys, was excited with anger. And the monkey-chief was now on the look-out for an opportunity to strike Birupāksha. And immediately in anger he struck him down with a blow on his forehead. And being thus assailed with the fist resembling the thunder-bolt of Mahendra, he fell down on the earth bathed in a pool of blood. And blood gushed out of the person of Birupāksha like unto water issuing out of a fountain. And the monkeys beheld their enemy (Birupāksha) with his eyes disfigured in anger, bathed in a foam of blood, his whole body discoloured, trembling, rolling and crying piteously. Thereupon those two armies of the monkeys and Rākshasas, being ready to engage in the encounter, began to roar like unto two mighty oceans having their banks broken. And observing that highly powerful Rākshasa, of discoloured eyes, slain by the king of monkeys, the monkeys and Rākshasa forces engaged in fight and looked like the rising Ganges."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Like unto a pond in the summer both the armies became gradually reduced. Beholding his own army and Birupāksha slain, Rāvana, the lord of Rākshasas, was doubly excited with ire. And observing his army reduced and slain by the heroic (monkeys) he perceived ill omens in the fight and was accordingly pained at heart. And he addressed Mahodara, who was near him, saying, \"O thou of great arms, all my hopes of success are now centered in thee. Do thou slay the enemy's force, O hero, and display thy prowess. Now hath come the time of returning the favours of thy master. Do thou fight bravely\". Being thus accosted that Rākshasa-chief Mahodara, saying \"so be it\" entered the enemy's army like unto a fly entering into a flame. Excited by his master's command and empowered by his own prowess that (Rākshasa) gifted with great strength, began to assail the monkeys. And the highly powerful monkeys too taking up huge crags dashed against the dreadful army of the enemies and crushed all the Rākshasas. And Mahodara, greatly angered, severed in that mighty encounter, with his arrows feathered in gold, the hands, feet and thighs of the monkeys. Then the monkeys, in fear of the Rākshasas, fled away to different quarters and some sought shelter of Sugriva. And beholding his powerful monkey force thus assailed in the conflict, Sugriva dashed forward and fronted Mahodara. And taking up a huge and dreadful crag resembling a mountain, the monkey-king hurled it with great vehemence to slay him. Thereupon finding that crag about to fall, Mahodara fearlessly severed it with his arrows. And being sundered into a thousand pieces by the arrow of that Rākshasa, it fell down on the earth like unto a band of vultures. And beholding that crag thus severed, Sugriva was beside himself with ire; and uplifting a sāla tree hurled it: and the heroic Rākshasa, the slayer of enemy's force, severed it into several pieces with his arrows. Thereupon excited with wrath he saw a parigha on the ground. And hurling that flaming parigha and displaying his (light-handedness) he struck his excellent horse therewith. And having his horse slain, that hero—the Rākshasa Mahodara, ascended his car, and in great anger took up his club. Those two heroes, with club and parigha in their hands, engaged in battle, roaring like two bulls or clouds accompanied with lightning. Thereupon the night-ranger Mahodara, inflamed with ire, hurled at Sugriva, the club flaming like the Sun. And beholding that dreadful club about to fall the highly powerful Sugriva—the lord of monkeys, uplifting his parigha struck it therewith. And the parigha, being sundered, fell quickly down on the earth. Thereupon the effulgent Sugriva picked up from the ground a musala made of iron and ornamented with gold. Taking that musala up he hurled it at the Rākshasa and who again hurled a club; and both of them being severed fell down on the earth. Having their weapons baffled thus, those two heroes, gifted with great prowess and effulgence and resembling the burning fire, were ready to interchange blows. They, emitting roars again and again, struck each other down on the earth with their clenched fists. And rising up speedily they again assailed each other. Thus those two heroes, unsubdued, struck each other with their arms. Thereupon both of them, highly proficient in fighting with arms, were greatly exhausted. Thereupon they took up daggers. And uplifting them, (those two heroes) with their persons trembling in ire, proficient in fighting and skilled in the use of weapons, dashed on roaring. And both of them enraged with each other and anxious to score success, moving in a circle on each other's right side, addressed themselves for action. Thereupon the vicious-minded, heroic Mahodara, gifted with great vehemence and proud of his own heroism, flung his dagger at (the monkey's) armour. And as he was about to extricate his dagger from the armour, that foremost of monkeys severed with his dagger that Rākshasa's head with helmet and kundalas. And beholding the Rākshasa-chief fall down on the earth with his head off, his forces fled away from the field. And slaying him that monkey-chief, delighted, began to roar along with other monkeys. There-upon the Ten-necked one became highly enraged and Rāghava greatly delighted. And all the Rākshasas, with their hearts broken and countenances rendered poorly and stricken with fear fled away to different quarters. Slaying and striking down on earth Mahodara like unto a portion of a mighty hill severed, that son of the Sun appeared resplendent in his own effulgence and became irrepressible like unto the Sun. And winning victory in the action that lord of monkeys was espied by the celestials, Siddhas and Yakshas along with all creatures on earth, having their eyes flushed with joy."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Mahodara being thus slain by Sugriva, the highly powerful Mahāparshwa, having his eyes reddened with ire, looked towards him. And the Rākshasa, with his weapons, assailed the dreadful army of Angada as well as the leading monkeys. The Rākshasa severed the heads from the bodies of the monkeys like unto the wind throwing away the fruits from trees. And he cut off, with his arrows, the arms of some and some were deprived of their sides. The monkeys were thus assailed by Mahāparshwa with a shower of shafts. All the monkeys were thus stricken with grief and rendered senseless. And hearing of the anxiety of his own army thus assailed by the Rākshasa, Angada, gifted with great vehemence, taking his parigha made of iron and resembling the rays of the sun, dashed on like the rising deep during the lunar half of a month. And that foremost of monkeys encountered Mahāparshwa, who, thus struck by the monkey, became insensible with his charioteer and fell down on the earth. Thereupon leaped on the battle-field the highly powerful and effulgent lord of bears, having the hue of red collyrium, with his army resembling the cloud. And excited with ire, he, taking up a huge crag resembling the summit of a mountain, speedily struck down his horses and broke down his car. And regaining his senses in a moment the highly powerful Mahāparshwa, again assailed Angada with many arrows. He struck Jāmbavān, the lord of bears, on his breast with three arrows and assailed Gabāksha with many shafts. And beholding Jāmbavān and Gabāksha overwhelmed with arrows, Angada, beside himself with ire, took up a dreadful parigha. And holding with two hands that parigha made of iron and bright like the rays of the sun, Angada, the son of Vāli, with his eyes reddened in wrath, hurled it at Mahāparshwa who was stationed at a distance, to slay him. And being hurled by the highly powerful (Angada) the parigha, struck down from his hands the bow with arrows and the helmet of the Rākshasa. And approaching him vehemently, Vāli's son, gifted with great prowess, in anger, struck him, with clenched fist, on his ears having excellent kundalas. There-upon Mahāparshwa gifted with great vehemence and effulgence, highly angered, took up in his hands a huge parashivadha, sharpened with oil, bright and hard as iron and discharged it at Vāli's son, and struck him therewith on his left shoulder. And Angada baffled that parashwadha. Thereupon that hero, powerful like his own father, clenching his fist, hard as thunder-bolt and resembling even Indra's açani, dealt it, in great anger, upon the Raksha's breast. And being struck with that fist the Rākshasa's breast was shattered and lie fell down on earth. He falling down on earth slain, his soldiers were greatly sorry and Rāvana attained to an excess of ire in the conflict. The noise set up by the delighted monkeys like unto a dreadful leonine roar, as if rending the city of Lankā abounding in edifices and gates, resembled the great roar of the celestials along with Indra. And hearing the noise of the celestials and monkeys, the lord of Rākshasas, the enemy of the gods, in great anger, again proceeded towards the battle field."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Beholding Mahodara, Mahāparsha and the highly powerful Birupāksha slain in the encounter Rāvana attained to an excess of ire. And ordering his charioteer to hurry on he gave vent to the following words—\"All my courtiers have been slain and my city is shut up—I shall remove my grief consequent on all these by slaying Rāma and Lakshmana. I shall destroy Rāma-like tree in the conflict whose flower is Sitā and whose branches are Sugriva, Jāmbavān, Kumuda, Nala, Divida, Mainda, Angada, Gandhamādana, Hanumān and all other leading monkeys\". And resounding the ten quarters with the sound of his chariot wheels that mighty car-warrior proceeded quickly towards Rāghava. With that sound all quarters were filled, and the earth, with rivers, mountains and forests shook and all the lions, deer and birds were terrified. He created a dreadful darkness with the discharge of his sharp weapons and burnt down the monkeys who fled away to different directions. Dust was raised on the ground by those monkeys assailed and flying to various directions. They were unable to withstand the power of that weapon made by Brahmā himself. Beholding his own army, assailed and cut into hundred pieces by the excellent weapons of Rāvana, Rāghava dashed forward. And assailing the monkey-host, that foremost of Rākshasas espied Rāma, unconquered, at a distance with his brother Lakshmana like unto Bāsava with Vishnu, holding a huge bow like one painted on the sky, having expansive eyes like lotus-petals, long arms, and always subduing the enemies. Beholding the monkeys slain in the encounter and Rāvana approach, the heroic and highly powerful Rāma, with Sumitrā's son in his company, delightedly set arrows on his bow. And as if rending the whole earth with that dreadful sound he began to draw the string of his excellent bow. With the sound of Rāvana's arrows and the twang of Rāma's bow hundreds of Rākshasas fell down on earth. And coming within the range of the arrows of those two princes, Rāvana appeared like Rāhu in presence of the sun and the moon. And desiring to fight with him first Lakshmana setting sharp arrows on his bow, discharged shafts at him resembling the flame of fire. And the highly powerful Rāvana too with his arrows stopped the course of those shafts in the sky as soon as they were discharged by Lakshmana, skilled in archery. And displaying his light-handedness, he, with one arrow, severed Lakshmana's one, with three his three and with ten his ten. Surpassing thus the son of Sumitrā, Rāvana, ever victorious in battle, confronted Rāma in the encounter, standing like another hill. And approaching Rāghava, Rāvana the lord of Rākshasas, with his eyes reddened in ire, began to make a shower of arrows. Thereupon beholding the arrows shot off Rāvana's bow fall on all sides, Rāma speedily took up a valla.386 And Rāghava sundered with his sharp valla his dreadful arrows flaming and resembling poisonous serpents. With various sharpened arrows Rāghava assailed Rāvana, and he again assailed Rāma in return. And forming a circle, they passed each other by the right side. Uprooting the earth with the vehemence of their arrows, irrepressible by each other, fighting equally discharging arrows, they looked dreadful like Death himself—and created terror in all creatures. The sky was filled with their various weapons, like unto clouds in the rainy season accompanied with lightning. And the welkin appeared full of windows with that shower of arrows, sharpened, shot with great vehemence and winged like vultures. The earth was stricken with darkness caused by these arrows like unto clouds appearing after sunset. There took place a dreadful conflict between them, desiring to slay each other, having their prowess unknown and fighting like Vitra and Vāsava. Both of them were proficient in archery, skilled in the art of conflict and foremost of those conversant with the use of weapons. And they began to veer round the battle-field. And wherever they went, there appeared arrows like unto waves of the deep roused by the winds. Then that destroyer of creatures—Rāvana—with his hand engaged in discharging shafts, shot at Rāma's forehead a network of arrows. And thereat Rāma on his head bore that shower of shafts shot from his terrific bow, having the lustre of the petals of blue lotuses; nor did he experience any pain, And then reciting a formula, the exceedingly energetic Rāma endowed with prowess, wrought up with wrath, engaged in incessantly shooting his shafts, taking his Raudra weapon and again seizing his arrows, discharged them at that lord of Rākshasas. And alighting at the impenetrable hail of the Kakshasa-chief, resembling a mass of mighty clouds, those arrows did not then occasion him any pain. Again Rāma skilled in all weapons, from a powerful weapon discharged arrows at the sovereign of the Rākshasas mounted on his car. And piercing Rāvana, those like unto five-hooded serpents, resisted by him, entered the earth, hissing. Having baffled Rāghava's weapon, Rāvana, transported with passion, took up a dreadful Asura weapon; and discharged sharpened shafts having the faces of lions and tigers, and the faces of kankas and kokas387 and the faces of vultures and hawks, and the faces of jackals, and the faces of wolves,—with gaping mouths,—and terrific of aspect; five-mouthed and red-hued. And that highly powerful one, enraged, sighing like a snake, by his power of illusion shot at Rāma other keen arrows having the faces of mules and the faces of bears, and the faces of dogs and cocks, and the faces of makaras388 and venomous serpents,—these as well as others. Covered with that Asura weapon, that foremost of the Raghus, himself resembling fire, discharged an exceedingly vigorous weapon informed with fire; and shot various shafts having faces filled with live flames, and faces like unto suns,—and hued like unto planets and stars,—and furnished with faces resembling mighty meteors, or resembling tongues of lightning. And those terrific shafts of Rāvana, resisted by Rāghava's weapon, were annihilated in the sky, and destroyed (monkeys) by thousands. And seeing that weapon (of Rāvana) destroyed by Rāma of untiring deeds, all those heroes, the monkeys—headed by Sugriva, capable of wearing forms at will, shouted, surrounding Rāghava. And the high-souled son of Daçaratha—Rāghava—having by his might destroyed that weapon discharged by Rāvana's arms, was delighted; and the monkey-chiefs, filled with glee, began to emit shouts."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "On that weapon of his having been baffled, Rāvana—lord of the Rākshasas—was fired with double fury, and the highly effulgent Rāvana from wrath set about discharging at Rāghava a dreadful Raudra weapon, which had been conferred on him by Maya. And from his bow began to issue forth in large numbers darts and maces and clubs, flaming and having the might of thunder; and various kinds of sharp clubs and daggers and nooses and flaming thunderbolts began to descend like unto the winds at the universal tumbling. And thereupon the graceful and exceedingly effulgent Rāghava—foremost of those accomplished in noble arms—resisted that weapon with a powerful Gāndharva weapon. On that weapon being baffled by the high-souled Rāghava, Rāvana, with his eyes rendered coppery with passion, took up a Solar weapon. Thereupon from the bow of the wondrous vehement and intelligent Ten-necked one rushed out discuses flaming and mighty. And the firmament all round blazed up with those impendent (arms), as blaze up the cardinal quarters on the Sun and the Moon and the planets dropping down. Thereat Rāghava in the van of that army by means of vollies of shafts cut off Rāvana's wonderful weapons and discuses. And seeing that weapon destroyed, Rāvana—lord of Rākshasas—with ten arrows pierced Rāma all through his vitals. And pierced by Rāvana with those ten shafts discharged from his mighty bow, the exceedingly powerful Rāghava did not so much shake. Then Rāghava—victor in fight—waxing wondrous wroth, with countless shafts pierced Rāvana all over his person. In the meanwhile Rāghava's younger brother, the mighty Lakshmana—destroyer of foes—growing enraged, took up seven arrows. And with those highly impetuous arrows that exceedingly effulgent one severed the human-headed standard of Rāvana. And the mighty and graceful Lakshmana with a shaft cut off the head of the Nairita's charioteer, illumined with ear-rings. And then with five sharpened arrows Lakshmana severed the bow of the Rākshasa-chief, resembling the trunk of an elephant. And Bibhishana, bounding up, with his mace despatched Rāvana's excellent steeds, resembling hills or dark-blue clouds. Thereat, leaping down from his mighty car, whose horses had been slain, Rāvana was fired with high wrath against his brother. And the powerful lord of Rākshasas endowed with immense strength, hurled at Bibhishana a dart resembling the flaming thunder-bolt. And ere the dart had reached its destination, Lakshmana severed it with three shafts; and thereat in that mighty conflict there arose a mighty uproar from the monkeys. And the dart dight with networks of gold fell down in three fragments, as droppeth a mighty meteor from the firmament, flaming and shooting out scintillations. Then (Rāvana) took up a huge dart, glowing in its own energy, celebrated as being irrisistible, and incapable of being borne by the Destroyer himself. On being whirled by the impious and strong Rāvana, the dart possessed of exceeding energy, flamed up. In the meanwhile the heroic Lakshmana swiftly came to the side of Bibhishana,389 whose life was placed in peril. And in order to save him, that hero—Lakshmana—drawing his bow, covered the dart-handed Rāvana with showers of shafts. On being covered with arrows shot by that high souled one, Rāvana, with his prowess baffled, made up his mind to let (his brother) go. And seeing his brother delivered by Lakshmana, Rāvana, facing Lakshmana, spoke these words,—\"O thou proud of thy prowess! as Bibhishana hath this wise been delivered by thee, passing by the Rākshasa, this dart, discharged from my bludgeon of an arm, will depart, depriving thee of thy life\". Having said this, Rāvana, waxing furiously enraged, discharged at Lakshmana that dart forged by Maya with his power of illusion, furnished with eight bells, having mighty sounds,—incapable of being resisted,—competent to finish foes; and flaming in energy,—and shouted simultaneously. And hurled with terrific force, the dart sending sounds resembling that of Vajra or the thunder-bolt, vehemently alighted at Lakshmana in that encounter. Thereat, as the dart descended, Rāghava addressed390 it, saying,—\"Peace be to Lakshmana! Be thou frustrated; and let thy energy go out of thee\". But the dart discharged in the encounter by the enraged Rāvana, resembling a venomous serpent, dived into the dauntless and heroic Lakshmana; and (the dart) exceedingly splendid and blazing, possessed of dreadful impetuosity; and resembling the tongue of the king of serpents, smote Lakshmana in his mighty chest. And with his breast riven by the dart, driving deep through the force of Rāvana, Lakshmana fell down to the earth. And Rāghava, standing by, seeing Lakshmana in that plight, had his heart overspread with sorrow. But reflecting only for a while, he, with his eyes surcharged with tears, was filled with greater martial ardour, and resembled the fire risen at the universal dissolution. Then thinking,—'This is not the time to indulge in grief;' he, gazing at Lakshmana, entered into a terrific encounter, resolved upon slaying Rāvana, laying under contribution his dearest energies. And Rāma saw Lakshmana with his chest riven by the dart in the mighty conflict, lying drenched in blood, and resembling a hill with serpents present in it—And in spite of all their efforts, the foremost monkeys failed to extract the dart which had been hurled by the powerful Rāvana.—And, further, they were (all the while) sore assailed with showers of shafts by the foremost Rākshasa of them all. The dart, having pierced Sumitrā's son, had entered the earth. In the encounter the mighty Rāma, grasping the dreadful dart with his hands, extracted the same and wrathfully snapped it.391 As he (Rāma) was engaged in pulling the dart out, the mighty Rāvana kept pouring marrow-piercing shafts all over his person. Thinking nothing of those arrows, Rāma, embracing Lakshmana, spoke unto Hanumān and the mighty monkey, Sugriva,—\"Ye foremost of monkeys, do ye stay here, surrounding Lakshmana. The opportunity for putting forth my prowess which I had sought, is present. I shall slay this wicked-minded Ten-necked one, who is resolved to pursue the course of unrighteousness. Even as on the expiry of summer the Chātaka is eager for the sight of clouds, I had long been eager to obtain a sight of (Rāvana.) Ye monkeys, this, I swear unto you,—this very hour not long after ye will see this world without Rāvana or Rāma. To-day having slain Rāvana in battle, I shall renounce all sorrow arising from the loss of my kingdom, from my sojourn in the woods, from my wandering in Dandaka, from the ravishment of Vaidehi, from encounter with the Rakshas,—all the terrible evils that I have suffered, and all the troubles resembling hell. He for whom I have brought over the monkey-forces, made Sugriva king, slaying Vāli in battle, for whom I have crossed the ocean and constructed a bridge over the deep—the same hath been come at by me in conflict, and the same hath come within the range of my vision.—And having come within my ken, Rāvana will not live, even as one coming within ken of a serpent of poisonous sight, doth not live; or even as a serpent doth not live, coming within ken of Vinatā's392 son. Do ye, ye irrepressible ones, ye foremost of monkeys, seated at the brow of the mountain, behold the battle between me and Rāvana. To day let the three worlds with the Gandharvas, and the Siddhas, and the Chiranas, see that for which Rāma is Rāma. To-day I shall do a deed of which the worlds with the mobile and the immobile and the gods, shall speak as long as the Earth sustaineth (creatures.)\" Having delivered himself thus, Rāma, concentrating his attention, began to charge the Ten-necked one in encounter with whetted arrows decked with burnished gold. And in the same way Rāvana showered on Rāma great nārāchas and clubs, even as clouds pour down showers. And there arose a tremendous uproar of mighty arrows discharged by Rāma and Rāvana, smiting one another. And the shafts shot by Rāma and Rāvana, severed and scattered, with flaming heads dropped to the Earth. And the mighty twangs of the bow-strings of both, terrifying all creatures, were wonderful to behold.393 And then even as clouds disperse on being trampled by the Winds, Rāvana, covered with showers of arrowy networks by that high souled one and reduced to sore straits by that one (Rāma) of a glowing bow, fled away in fear."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Seeing the heroic Lakshmana brought down by the dart discharged by the powerful Rāvana, and lying drenched in blood, he (Rāma) after having fought furiously with the wicked-minded Rāvana,—and having showered vollies of shafts, addressed Sushena, saying,—\"This heroic Lakshmana brought down to the earth by the prowess of Rāvana, lieth like a serpent, enhancing my sorrow. Seeing this hero, dearer to me than life, what power have I, with my soul overwhelmed with dole, to fight? If this brother of mine graced with auspicious marks, delighting in battle, breathe his last, what shall life avail me or happiness? My prowess is ashamed; my bow falleth off from my hand; my arrows droop; my sight is dimmed with tears; my limbs weaken as do those of men in a dream; thought racks me; and I even desire death\". Seeing his brother wounded by the wicked-minded Rāvana, crying in preternatural accents, and sore stricken in his vitals, (Rāma) overcome by a mighty sorrow, lamented with his senses wildered. \"Seeing my brother, Lakshmana, wounded, and lying over the dust of the field, even victory, O hero, doth not seem to me sweet. If the Moon is hid from the sight, whom doth he then delight? What have I to do with battle? What have I to do with life? I have no more to do anything with fighting, seeing that this Lakshmana wounded, lieth in the field of battle. As this highly effulgent one had followed me into the forest, so will I in the same way follow him to the abode of Yama. Ever seeking my welfare and ever devoted to me, he hath been reduced to this pass by Rākshasas fighting in crooked ways. In land after land one meets with wives, in land after land one meets with friends, but country find I none where a uterine brother may be met with. What, O irrepressible one, shall I do with the kingdom without my Lakshmana? And what shall I say unto mother Sumitrā, fond of her son? And I shall never be able to bear the reproach Sumitrā shall cast upon me. And what shall I say unto Kauçalyā, and what unto mother Kaikeyi? And what shall I say unto Bharata, and what unto the exceedingly powerful Satrughna? 'Thou hadst gone to the woods with him. Why then dost thou come (back) without him?' 'Tis better (for me) to renounce my life here, instead of bearing the censure of friends. What a sin had I committed in another birth, seeing that my virtuous brother, staying before me, hath been slain? Ah, my brother! Thou best of men! O master, who wert the foremost of heroes! Why, forsaking me, dost thou repair to the other regions. Wherefore, brother, dost thou not speak to me, who am lamenting? Get up. See! Why dost thou lie down? Look on me with thine eyes. O mighty-armed one, in the woods and mountains thou didst ever use to cheer me, tried by grief and pining in despondency, with my mind overwhelmed (with woe)\". As Rāma was speaking thus with his senses overwhelmed with emotion, Sushena, soothing him, spoke these pregnant words,—\"O foremost of men, cast off this train of thought tending to overwhelm thy understanding,—this anxiety giving birth to grief, and resembling the shafts of foes in the van of the embattled forces. Lakshmana enhancer of auspiciousness is not dead. His face is not distorted or blackened. Do thou look at his countenance, which is beautifully bright and cheerful. His hands have palms resembling lotus-petals, and his eyes are pleasant. O king, one dead doth not look thus. (Therefore), O hero, do not grieve. O subduer of enemies, this one is instinct with life. As he is lying down on the ground, stretched at length, his heart, O hero, trembling momentarily, testifieth to his respiration\". Having spoken thus unto Rāghava, the highly wise Sushena thus addressed the mighty monkey, Hanumān, saying,—\"O placid one, hieing hence to the mountain, Mahodaya, which, O hero, had formerly been mentioned unto thee by Jāmbavān, bring hither the mighty drug sprung at its right summit—Viçalyakaranī by name, and Sāvarnyakaranī,394 and Sanjīvakaranī, O hero, and the potent medicine—Sandhānī. Do thou bring (these) in order that the hero—Lakshmana—may be revived\". Having been thus instructed, Hanumān, repairing to the Medicinal mountain, was wrought up with anxiety, not knowing the drugs. And then the thought sprang up in the mind of the Wind-god's offspring of immeasurable prowess,—\"I shall go, even taking this (entire) summit of the mountain. In this very summit must that delightful drug have sprung. This I infer, inasmuch as Sushena had forsooth said so. If I fail to take Viçalyakaranī, I shall come by disgrace,—and if I spend much time (in thought), that would be fraught with evil\".395 Having reflected thus, the exceedingly powerful Hanumān, foremost of monkeys,—swiftly drawing up to that best of mountains, and giving three shakes to the mountain filled with various flowering trees,—raised it up with his hands. And taking that summit of the mountain resembling dark-blue clouds charged with rain, Hanumān from the earth bounded up into the sky. And arriving (at his quarters), that wondrous vehement one, putting down the mountain-peak, and reposing for a while, spoke unto Sushena,—\"I did not find the drug, O best of monkeys; and therefore have I brought this entire summit of the mountain\". When the Wind-god's offspring had spoken thus, that foremost of monkeys—Sushena—praising him, uprooted the herb and secured it. Seeing Hanumān's feat, incapable of being done by even the celestials, the choicest of the monkeys were amazed. Then crushing the healing herb, that best of monkeys—the exceedingly effulgent Sushena, made Lakshmana smell the same. And thereupon the wounded Lakshmana,—slayer of hostile heroes—smelling it, cured of his wound and ailments, speedily rose up from the ground. Seeing Lakshmana rise up from the earth, the monkeys, exceedingly rejoiced, honoring Lakshmana, exclaimed, \"Excellent! Excellent!\" \"Come!\" said that slayer of hostile heroes—Rāma—and with his eyes filled with tears, he deeply embraced Lakshmana. And having embraced Sumitrā's son, Rāghava then addressed him, saying—\"By good fortune it is that, O hero, I see thee returned from (the mansion of) Death.—Verily my life, or Sitā, or Victory is worthless (without thee). And thou being dead, what is my life worth?\" When the high-souled Rāghava had spoken thus, Lakshmana, aggrieved on account of the words (of Rāghava) expressive of infirmity of purpose, said,—\"Having bound thyself by that vow, it doth not, O thou having truth for prowess, behove thee to speak like one fickle and feeble. Those speaking the truth, never falsify their promise: the mark of a great one is even observance of vow. O sinless one, do not suffer thyself to be overcome by despair on my account. Do thou to-day by slaying Rāvana, make thy promise good. Thy foe coming within the sway of thy shafts, will not hence, living, even like a mighty elephant coming before a sharp-toothed roaring lion. I wish the speedy destruction of this impious one, ere the maker of day, having performed his work, has ascended the Setting-hill.396 If thou wishest to slay Rāvana in battle, if thou desirest to recover the princess, then, O noble one, O hero, to-day speedily set about what I say\"."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Hearing the words uttered by Lakshmana, that slayer of hostile heroes—Rāghava—endued with prowess, taking his bow, set shafts on it, and in the brunt of battle began to discharge dreadful arrows at Rāvana. And mounted on another car, Rāvana—lord of Rākshasas—rushed against Kākutstha, even as Swarbhānu rusheth against the Sun. And even as a mass of clouds poureth down torrents on a mighty mountain, the Ten-necked one, mounted on his car, smote Rāma with shafts resembling thunder-bolts. And in the encounter Rāma, concentrating his thoughts, showered on the Ten-necked one arrows embellished with gold and looking like living fire. And celestials and Gandharvas and Kinnaras declared that there had been no other battle like unto the encounter of Rāma stationed on the ground and the Raksha mounted on his car. Then the foremost of celestials—Sakra—hearing their ambrosial speech, summoning Mātali, said,—\"Taking my car, hie to the best of the Raghus. And reaching the earth, do thou, welcoming (him), bring about great good unto the gods\". Thus accosted by the sovereign of the celestials, Mātali—celestial charioteer—bending down his head, addressed that celestial, saying,—\"Speedily shall I go, O lord of the celestials; and I shall also do the office of a charioteer (unto Rāghava)\". Then yoking with steeds that best of cars, curiously wrought with gold; adorned with hundreds of small bells; resembling the Sun new risen; having its pole studded with lapises; yoked with excellent horses caparisoned in gold; furnished with white chowris,—drawn by steeds resembling the Sun; decked with golden net-works,—and provided with a golden standard,—the graceful car of the sovereign of the celestials,—Mātali, commanded by the king of the immortals, ascending the car, went out of the celestial regions and came to Kākutstha. And with his hand holding the reins, the charioteer of the thousand-eyed (Deity) with joined hands addressed Rāma, saying,—\"O Kākutstha, in order that thou mayst obtain the victory, the thousand-eyed (god) hath sent thee this car. And, O exceedingly powerful one! O graceful (hero)! thou that slayest thy foes! this is the redoubtable bow of Indra,—and this is the mail resembling fire,—and these are the arrows looking like the very Sun; and this is the dart shining and fraught with fair fortune. Ascend thou this car, O hero. Slay the Rākshasa—Rāvana, with me as thy charioteer, even as the lord of the celestials slayeth Dānavas\". Thus addressed, Rāma, going round the car and saluting it, ascended the same, illumining the worlds with his splendour. And the encounter that took place between the two cars with the mighty-armed Rāma (on one side), and the Raksha—Rāvana—(on the other), was wonderful to behold. And Rāghava highly proficient in weapons with a Gāndharva weapon resisted the Gāndharva weapon of the Rākshasa king, and with a celestial weapon, his celestial weapon. And then that lord of Rākshasas—the night-ranger—fired with high rage, again discharged an exceedingly dreadful Rākshasa weapon. And the gold-decked shafts shot from Rāvana's bow, becoming furiously venomous serpents, covered Kākutstha. And vomitting living flames, they of terrific aspect, having flaming faces, showered over Rāma with gaping mouths. And those flaming venomous serpents, having the feel of Vāsuki himself, covered all sides and enveloped all quarters. And seeing those serpents descending in the encounter, Rāma employed a dreadful Gāruda weapon. And discharged from Rāghava's bow, those arrows plated with gold at the feathered parts, and furnished with the splendour of peacocks, becoming golden birds—began to range (the field of battle) as the enemies of the serpents. And the shafts of Rāma capable of wearing forms at will, turned into birds, destroyed all the exceedingly swift-coursing arrows having the forms of serpents. On his weapon having been baffled, Rāvana—lord of Rākshasas—waxing Wroth, poured tremendous showers of shafts on Rāma. And smiting Rāma of untiring deeds with thousands of shafts, (Rāvana) pierced Mātali with vollies of arrows. And with an arrow, Rāvana severed the standard; and having brought down the golden standard on the floor of the car, Rāvana wounded even Indra's steeds with a net-work of arrows. And seeing Rāma hard pressed, celestials and Gandharvas, and Chāranas along with Dānavas, and Siddhas, and the supreme saints were overcome with sadness; and the foremost monkeys together with Bihhishana were aggrieved. And seeing a Moon of Rāma Chandra in the grasp of a Rāhu of Rāvana, that bringer of evil unto creatures—Budha—stood, assailing the Prayāpatya star—Rohini—beloved of the Moon. And the enraged Ocean, heaving with smoking surges, and flaming as it were, swelled up, seeming to the touch the Sun. And the Sun was blackened and assumed a stern aspect, with his rays dimmed. And he was seen with a headless trunk on his lap, and he was in conjunction with a comet. And that star of the Koçalas, relating to the deities—Indra and Agni—Angaraka—stood in the sky, attacking Viçākhā. And the Ten-necked one, having ten faces and twenty arms, equipped with his bow, looked like the mountain—Maināka. And Rāma reduced to sore straits by the Ten-necked Raksha, could not discharge his arrows in the conflict. And then the enraged Rāma with his eyes slightly red, flew into a tremendous passion, as if burning up the Rākshasas. Seeing the face of the enraged Rāma endued with understanding, all the creatures were overwhelmed with fear and the Earth herself shook. And mountains abounding with lions and tigers began to tremble, and trees to shiver. And even the deep—lord of streams—was wrought up wondrously. And rough and terrific clouds in the sky sent forth fierce roars. And stormy clouds rumbling went about the heavens. And seeing Rāma wrought up with a mighty passion, and the fearful disastrous omens, all creatures were possessed by fright and Rāvana was struck with dismay. And then stationed in the sky, celestials and Gandharvas and mighty serpents and saints and Dānavas and Daityas and those related to Gāruda—fowls—beheld that conflict like unto the universal tumbling, as the two heroes fought on with various dire arms. And as they looked on the mighty encounter, the celestials and the Asuras, who had come to the conflict, from feeling of regard397 cheerfully spoke (these words). And the Asuras staying there said unto the Ten-necked one, 'Be victorious!' and the celestials again and again said unto Rāma, 'Be victorious!' In the meantime, the impious Rāvana, desirous of slaying Rāghava, from wrath took up a mighty weapon, fraught with the essence of the thunder-bolt; sending terrible sounds; capable of destroying all foes,—furnished with forks resembling mountain-peaks; tending to strike terror unto mind and sight; sharp-pointed, resembling the smoking fire risen at the hour of universal dissolution; exceedingly terrible; irrisistible (in battle); unbearable even by the Destroyer,—the terror of all creatures—terrific; and competent to rive (all things). Flaming up with wrath, Rāvana took this dart. And fired with furious wrath, that powerful one took the dart in the encounter, surrounded in that contest by many heroic Rākshasas. And uplifting (the dart), the huge-bodied Rāvana, with his eyes reddened in passion, emitted mighty roars. And the shouts of the Rākshasa sovereign made the earth and the sky and the cardinal quarters and all sides tremble. And at the roars of that wicked-minded and huge-bodied one, all creatures were struck with terror, and the sea was vexed.398 And the exceedingly energetic Rāvana, taking that mighty dart, and sending up furious shouts, addressed Rāma in a harsh speech, saying,—\"O Rāma, I in wrath uplift this dart having the strength of the levin. This will utterly deprive of life thee who art assisted by thy brother. O thou that delightest in battle, to-day swiftly slaying thee, I shall make thee even with those heroic Rakshas slain in the van of the forces. Stay now. O Rāghava, thee shall I slay with this dart\". Saying this, the lord of the Rākshasas hurled the dart. And discharged from Rāvana's hand, (the dart), surrounded with garlands of lightning, furnished with eight bells, sending mighty roars,—rising to the sky, looked exceedingly splendid. Seeing the dart, flaming and of terrific aspect, Raghu's son—Rāma—endowed with prowess, drawing his bow, discharged arrows. And with vollies of shafts Rāghava resisted the descending (dart), even as Vāsava extinguished the fire of doomsday with his showers. Then even as a flame consumeth insects, the mighty dart of Rāvana burnt up those shafts shot from the bow of Rāma. Seeing those shafts reduced to ashes and crushed on coming in contact with the dart, as they were coursing in the sky, Rāghava was transported with passion. And then waxing wondrous wroth,—Raghu's son—Rāghava—took up a javelin, liked by Vāsava himself, brought by Mātali. And on being wielded by that strong one, the javelin, resonant with bells, made the welkin blaze up, like a burning meteor on the occasion of universal rack. And when hurled, it alighted on that same dart of the Rākshasa-chief. And thereat, with its splendour lost, the mighty dart, riven, dropped (to the earth.) Then Rāma, shooting straight-speeding arrows, pierced his (Rāvana's) exceedingly fleet steeds. And then he pierced Rāvana in the chest with whetted arrows. And the energetic Rāghava hit (Rāvana) in the temples with three feathered shafts. And thereat with all his limbs pierced (with arrows), and his body laved in blood, the lord of Rākshasas furnished with many limbs, looked like a flowering Açoka. And with his person pierced with the shafts of Rāma, the lord of night-rangers having his body drenched with blood, was stricken with sadness in the midst of his forces,—and was also overwhelmed with terrific wrath."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "On being greatly harassed by Kākutstha in anger, Rāvana, delighting in battle, came under the sway of a towering passion. And with his eyes aglow, that powerful one from wrath and fury assailed Rāghava in mighty encounter. And even as clouds pour down from the sky on a pool, Rāvana showered thousands of arrows on Rāghava. And covered with vollies of shafts discharged from (Rāvana's) bow in the conflict, Kākutstha like unto a mighty mountain did not shake. And that one endowed with prowess stood in the field, resisting those networks of arrows, and took up shafts resembling the rays of the Sun. Then the fleet-handed night-ranger, fired with rage, discharged a thousand arrows at the chest of the high-souled Rāghava.—And thereat in that encounter Lakshmana's elder brother, with his body bathed in Mood, appeared like a mighty Kinçuka tree in a forest. And with his ire aroused by the blows he received, the exceedingly energetic Kākutstha took up arrows resembling the Sun risen at the time of the universal dissolution. And in the darkness spread by the arrows (discharged), Rāma and Rāvana both fired with wrath could not be discovered of each other. Then that hero—Daçaratha's son—Rāma, overcome with wrath, addressed Rāvana, laughing, in a harsh speech, saying,—\"Thou vilest of Rākshasas, in consequence of having through lack of sense carried off my wife from Janasthāna and brought her under thy subjection, thou hast been deprived of thy prowess. Having forcibly carried away Vaidehi staying in that mighty forest, forlorn and without me, thou thinkest—'I am a hero.' Outraging the helpless wives of others,—doing this craven deed, thou thinkest—'I am a hero.' O thou having thy dignity destroyed! shameless wight! O thou of volatile character, having through thy violence brought destruction on thyself, thou thinkest,—'I am a hero.' A great and' famous act hath been performed by thee,—a hero, and the brother of the Bestower of riches, surrounded with thy forces! To-day receive the mighty fruit of that infamous act done through pride, productive of evil.399 O wicked-minded one, thou thinkest of thyself—'I am a hero;' but thou that hast taken away Sitā like a thief, hast no feeling of shame. Hadst thou forcibly outraged Sitā in my very presence, thou, slain by my shafts, wouldst have seen thy brother—Khara. By luck, O thou of an evil soul, thou hast come within the range of my vision. To-day by means of sharp shafts shall I bring thee to death's door. To-day beasts of pray will drag thy head having burning ear-rings, severed by my shafts and covered with the dust of the battle-field. O Rāvana, vultures will alight on thy breast, as thou wilt lie low on the ground; and, athirst, they will drink the blood gushing out from thy wounds. To-day fowls of the air will keep pulling at thee pierced with my shafts, and lying lifeless, as birds do serpents\". Having spoken thus, that slayer of foes—Rāma—showered arrows on the lord of Rākshasas, staying before. And the prowess and strength and spirits and force of arms of Rāma burning for the destruction of his foe, were doubled. And all the Weapons400 presented themselves before that one cognisant of self; and the fleet-handedness of that exceedingly powerful one increased immensely from exhilaration of spirits. Seeing all these auspicious omens coming of themselves, Rāma, finisher of Rākshasas, set about smiting his foe more energetically than ever. And assailed with stones by the monkeys and showers of shafts by Rāghava, the Ten-necked one felt his heart undergoing a revolution.401 And when through the stupifaction of his inner self, he could not discharge any weapon, or draw his bow, or put forth his prowess, (Rāma) did not persist in smiting him. And the shafts and various arms discharged by him betokened his death; and his last moments were present. And his charioteer, driving his car, perceiving this, calmly took the car away from the field of fight. And then, seeing the king shorn of prowess, and dropt, his charioteer, struck with fear, swiftly turned away his dreadful car having the clatter of clouds, and went away from the field of battle."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "After gradually regaining his senses, Rāvana, urged on by the force of the Finisher, getting into a furious passion, with his eyes reddened in wrath, addressed the charioteer, saying,—\"O thou of perverse sense, disregarding me as devoid of prowess, and incompetent, and bereft of vigor,—as cowardly, light, nerveless and shorn of energy,—and as divorced by the power of illusion and debarred by arms,—thou actest on thine own understanding. Wherefore disregarding me, and not minding my purpose, hast thou taken away my car from before the presence of the enemy? O abject one! by thee have my long-earned renown and energy and prowess and credit been brought to naught. In the very sight of an enemy of renowned prowess, and one capable of being gratified with valorous deeds, hast thou made me, burning for battle, look as if I were a coward. As, O wicked-minded one, thou dost not even through heedlessness, take the car to the field of battle, I infer for certain that thou hast been bribed by the foe. The act that thou hast done, doth not appear as that of a friend seeking our welfare; but to-day thou hast acted like an enemy. If thou hast been maintained by me, if thou rememberest my merit, do thou swiftly turn the car before my enemy has departed\". Thus admonished by him of slender sense, the charioteer possessed of intelligence, humbly spake onto Rāvana words fraught with good,—\"I am not afraid, nor stupified, nor have I been bribed by the foe, nor am I negligent. And I have not forgotten thy affection or thy good offices. And studious of thy welfare, I have saved thy fame; and with a mind over-flowing with affection I have done (unto thee) this unpalatable good. O mighty monarch, for this, thou shouldst not, like a frivolous and base one, criminate me that am ever engaged in what is good and dear unto thee. Listen! I shall render thee reason why I turned away from the field the car, rushing like a river when the sea is swelled up.402 I knew that thou hadst been fatigued in consequence of thy mighty exertions in the fight. And I could not perceive that thy prowess then stood superior (to that of the foe).403 And the steeds of my car were worn out by carrying it; and they were battered, and helpless, and perspired like kine in a shower. And bad omens fast sprang up before us. And on these occurring, I perceived that things would go against us. O thou endowed with exceeding might, a charioteer should be conversant with season and place, with omens, and the expressions of emotions; as also with depression of spirits, exhilaration, and grief. And he should have a knowledge of low, level and uneven grounds, and the time for conflict, and he should be able to perceive the shortcomings of the enemy. And a charioteer mounted on a car, should know when to draw near an enemy, when to turn away from him; when to stay; and when to turn round from before the foe—all these (he should know). What I, for bringing respite unto thee as well as the horses of the car, have done by way of removing the terrific exhaustion, is proper. I did not, O hero, turn away the car of my own sheer will. What I have done, O lord, had been dictated by my affection for thee. Command me. What thou sayest, O destroyer of foes; I will do every way, O hero, with my whole soul\". Thereat, well-pleased with the speech of the charioteer, Rāvana, eager for encounter, after praising him in various ways, said,—\"O charioteer, do thou swiftly take the car towards Rāghava. Without slaying his foe in fight; Rāvana turneth not away (from the field)\". Speaking thus, Rāvana—lord of Rākshasas—gave the charioteer on the car an excellent ornament for the hand. Hearing Rāvana's words, the charioteer drove the car. And urged on by the speech of Rāvana, the charioteer drove on the steeds,—and in a moment the mighty chariot of the Rākshasa chief appeared before Rāma in the field of battle."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Then the revered Agastya, who, desirous of witnessing the fight, had along with the deities come there,—seeing Rāvana spent with the toil of conflict, staying in the field plunged in thought, and stationed before Rāma for engaging in encounter,—addressed Rāma, drawing near to him, saying,—\"Rāma, Rāma, O mighty-armed one, hearken to the eternal secret, whereby, my child, thou wilt conquer all foes in fight,—Aditya-hridaya,404 sacred, capable of destroying all foes, bringing victory—the recitation, enduring and indestructible,—and supremely good; fraught with all welfare, removing every sin,—chasing away anxiety and grief, bringing length of days; and excellent. Do thou worship Vivaçwata's offspring—the Sun—lord of the world, furnished with rays,—who maketh people engage in work, and who is bowed down to by deities and Asuras.

And he is Ātapi443 and Mandali444 and Mrityu.445 And he is Pingala,446 and the destroyer of everything, and the Omniscient, and he having the universe for his form,447 and the exceedingly energetic one, and the beloved of all, and that one lording it over all kinds of actions. And he is the lord448 of stars and planets and constallations, and the origin of everything, and the one powerful pre-eminently of powerful things449—and the one having twelve forms.450 I bow unto thee (having these forms and functions). Salutation unto the Eastern mount and the mount of the West. Salutation unto the lord of the stellar bodies and salutation also unto the lord of day. Salutation and salutation unto him that bringeth victory, and the joy that springeth up from victory; and unto him of yellow steeds. Salutation, salutation, O thousand-rayed one; Salutation and salutation unto Āditya. Salutation unto him that keepeth his senses under subjection; Salutation and salutation unto the Hero,451 and unto Sāranga452 and unto him that awakenest the Lotus.453 And (salutation) unto thee, O fierce one. Salutation unto the Lord himself of Brahmā, Içāna454 and Achchyuta,455 and unto Sura456 and unto him that constitutes the knowledge of Āditya, and unto him that unfoldeth me and not-me; and unto the devourer of all, and unto the form of the destroyer of the darkness of ignorance, Salutation unto the destroyer of darkness, and unto the destroyer of enemies, and unto him of immeasurable Soul, and unto the destroyer of the ingrate, and unto the deity, and unto the lord of all stellar bodies. And salutation unto him that boasteth of the splendour of burning gold, unto the destroyer of all mental obscurity,—and unto the maker of the universe. Salutation unto the remover of darkness; unto the illuminator of the Soul; unto the all-beholding one of all the worlds. The lord createth everything and verily destroyeth it. And with his rays he sucketh up, and destroyeth and createth (everything). When all are asleep, this one waketh, and he is resident in the hearts of all creatures. This one is both Agnihotra as well as the fruit reaped by the sacrifices thereof. And he constitutes the gods and the sacrifices and the fruit also thereof; and he is the lord of all acts that are performed by creatures. If a person recites this (hymn), he, O Rāghava, doth not come by misfortune, when he is in peril of his life, or is ill, or in a lonely place, or in fear. Do thou, with concentration, worship this god of gods, this lord of the universe. By reciting (this hymn) instinct with the three virtues, thou wilt obtain victory in battle. This very instant, O mighty-armed one, thou wilt conquer Rāvana\". Having said this, Agastya went whither from he had come. Hearing this, that exceedingly energetic one had his grief gone, Then, well pleased, Rāghava, exerting himself, contemplated (the hymn). And reciting this, he beholding the Sun, attained excess of joy. And sipping water again and again, and becoming purified, that powerful one, taking up his bow, and viewing Rāvana, advanced with a delighted heart, to obtain victory. And he became intent on his death with his dearest energies. Then exceedingly delighted, and filled with rejoicings, the Sun, in the midst of the celestial hosts knowing that the destruction of the Sovereign of the night-rangers was at hand,—spoke unto Rāma \"Bestir thyself\"."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Then the charioteer fully drove with speed Rāvana's car, capable of bringing down the hosts of foes, resembling in form a city of the Gandharvas, having elevated streamers, yoked with surpassingly superb steeds, engarlanded in gold; stocked with war-like implements; furnished with ensigns and standards; appearing to devour the welkin; making the earth herself resound; destructive to hostile hosts; and filling its own party with delight. And as it speedily descended, the monarch of men beheld that Rākshasa-king's resounding car, having huge standards, yoked with black chargers, and endowed with fierce splendour; as if flaming in the firmament; having the resplendance of the Sun himself; with thronging lightning pennons; displaying the glow of Indra's weapon;457 showering arms; and resembling rain-charged clouds. Seeing the enemy's car resembling a mass of clouds having a chatter resembling the sounds sent by a cleaving mountain rived by the thunder, Rāma, vehemently drawing his bow curved like the infant moon, addressed Mātali—charioteer unto the thousand-eyed (deity),458 saying,—\"O Mātali, behold the enraged chariot of my foe as it courseth on. From the furious speed with which he is again wheeling at my right, it appeareth that he hath set his heart on slaying me in encounter. Do thou therefore heedfully drive the car right against the vehicle of my foe. I wish to destroy this one even as the wind scattereth clouds that have appeared. Do thou with all thy wits about thee, without trepidation, and holding thy heart as well as thy eye in calmness, swiftly drive the chariot ruled by the reins. Worthy of Purandara's car, thou ought not to be taught by me. Desirous of encounter and my whole soul bent on fight, I simply remind thee—not teach thee\". Pleased with these words of Rāma, the excellent celestial charioteer—Mātali—drove the car. Then leaving Rāvana's mighty car on the right, he enveloped Rāvana with the dust raised by the wheels. Thereat the Ten-necked one, enraged, with his eyes coppery and dilated (in passion), covered with arrows Rāma staying in front of his car. Enraged at the smiting, Rāma, with his ire aroused, but summoning up patience, took up in the encounter the bow of Indra endowed with exceeding vehemence; as well as highly impetuous shafts having the resplendance of the solar rays. And then there began a furious encounter between those (two) eager for slaying each other; confronting each other like unto flaming lions. And then desirous of destruction of Rāvana,—celestials with Gandharvas, and Siddhas and supersaints assembled to go to behold the encounter taking place between the two cars. And for the destruction of Rāvana and the success of Rāghava, there occurred round about the cars terrible bodements capable of making people's down stand on end. The god poured down showers of blood on the car of Rāvana; and a violent tornado eddied on his right. And a mighty swarm of vultures, wheeling in the heavens, pursued the car wherever it moved. And Lankā was enveloped with evening resembling the red javā flowers and even in day appeared ablaze. Lightnings and firebrands accompanied by a terrible sound began to fall down on all sides. And beholding these omens inauspicious unto Rāvana all the Rākshasas were greatly sorry. And wherever Rāvana moved the earth shook and the hands of all the Rākshasas fighting were as if paralysed. The copper coloured, the yellow, the red, and the white rays of the sun falling before Rāvana appeared like melted metals of a mountain. And the jackals followed by vultures, vomitting forth fire and casting their looks at him, began to emit inauspicious cries. And in that battle-field the unfavourable wind began to blow raising dust and obstructing the vision of the king of Rākshasas. On the Rākshasa host on all sides dreadful lightnings were showered without the sound of the clouds. All the quarters were enshrouded with darkness and the welkin became invisible being covered with darkness. And setting up a dreadful quarrel hundreds of terrible Sharikas459 began to fall down on his chariot. The horses emitted forth sparks of fire from their hips and tears from their eyes. These and various other dreadful omens arose there announcing the destruction of Rāvana. And there appeared on all sides many an auspicious and good sign intimating the approach of Rāma's victory. And beholding all those auspicious marks announcing Rāma's success, Lakshmana was greatly delighted and considered Rāvana as slain. Thereupon beholding all those auspicious signs, Rāghava, well qualified to decipher them attained an excess of delight and became anxious to display a greater prowess."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Thereupon there ensued a mighty and dreadful encounter of two cars between Rāma and Rāvana, creating terror unto all people. And the army of Rākshasas and the mighty host of the monkeys, although they had weapons in their hands, became stupified (for the time being). And beholding them (Rāma and Rāvana) fight, all the Rākshasas and monkeys, having their minds agitated, were greatly surprised. With various weapons and hands uplifted for fight, they, greatly wondered, stood there beholding them and did not address themselves to fight with each other. The Rākshasas beholding Rāvana, and the monkeys beholding Rāma with wonder-stricken eyes, the whole army appeared like a picture. And espieing all omens Rāghava and Rāvana began to fight, undaunted, firm, resolute and unagitated by anger. And determining that Kākutstha would win victory and Rāvana would die, they began to display their own prowess. Thereupon the highly powerful Rāvana, setting his arrows in anger, discharged them at the pennon stationed on Rāghava's car. Those arrows reaching the flag staff of the Purandara chariot and perceiving its might fell down on the earth. Thereupon the highly powerful Rāma, wroth, stretching his bow, made up his mind to return the blow. And aiming at Rāvana's flag staff he discharged a sharpened shaft flaming unbearably by its own lustre like a huge serpent. And the effulgent Rāma discharged a shaft aiming at (Rāvana's) banner which, piercing the Ten-necked demon's flag fell, down on the earth. And beholding his flag staff thus broken down the highly powerful Rāvana became ablaze as if burning down every tiling with his unbearable ire And being possessed by wrath he began to make a downpour of shafts. Rāvana then, with flaming arrows, pierced Rāma's steeds. The celestial horses were not bewildered thereby nor their course was slackened. And they remained thoroughly unagitated as if they were stricken with lotus stalks. Beholding the steeds thus unmoved Rāvana was again exercised with wrath and began to discharge afresh his various weapons—gadās, parighas, chakras and musalas, mountain tops, trees, darts and parashus and thousands of other shafts by virtue of his illusive powers. And unmoved was his energy. And that downpour of various weapons became huge and terrible in the conflict creating terror and making a dreadful noise. Thereupon leaving aside Rāghava's car he began to assail the monkey-host and enveloped the sky with a continual discharge of arrows. The Ten-necked demon let loose many a weapon even at the risk of his own life. And beholding Rāvana in the encounter thus actively engaged in the discharge of arrows, Kākuthstha, smiling, set up pointed shafts, and discharged them by hundreds and thousands. Beholding them Rāvana again filled the welkin with arrows—and thus with shafts discharged by them both another flaming sky was created. None (of the arrows) missed the aim, none of them failed to pierce another and none of them was fruitless. And the arrows discharged by Rāma and Rāvana stricking each other fell down on the earth. And they standing on their right and left began to make a continued downpour of arrows and enveloped the sky entirely. And they opposing each other, Rāvana slew Rāma's steeds and Rāma in his turn slew Rāvanan's. They, thus enraged fought with each other and for sometime there ensued a terrible encounter capable of making ones down stand on end. And the highly powerful Rāvana and Rāma460 righting with each other in the conflict by means of sharpened arrows, the lord of Rākshasas beholding his flag staff broken down became enraged with the foremost of Raghus."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Rāma and Rāvana thus opposing each other in battle, all the animals beheld them, stricken with astonishment. And those two great heroes, highly angered, began to dash towards and assail each other; and being determined to slay each other they looked greatly dreadful. And their charioteers drove the cars on, displaying their skill by moving in circles, in rows and diverse other ways. And those two excellent heroes, discharging their shafts and influenced by illusions, assailed each other proceeding and receding, Rāma attacking Rāvana and Rāvana withstanding him. And these two cars coursed the earth for sometime like clouds accompanied by showers. And displaying many a movement in the conflict they again stood facing each other, the forepart of one car touching that of the other and the heads of the steeds touching each other; and the pennons, stationed on one touched those of the other. Rāma, with four sharpened arrows, shot off his bow, removed the flaming horses of Rāvana to some distance. And finding his steeds thus removed he was exercised with wrath. And the Ten-necked one discharged sharpened arrows at Rāghava. And he was pierced by those arrows coming from the powerful Ten-necked demon. He was neither overwhelmed nor pained therewith and he again discharged arrows resembling the thunder-bolts. And the Ten-necked demon again discharged arrows at the charioteer, which fell with great vehemence on the person of Mātali. Mātali was not the least pained or overwhelmed in that encounter. And beholding his charioteer thus assailed Rāma was excited with wrath and overwhelmed his foe with a net of arrows. And the heroic Rāghava showered on his enemy's chariot shafts by twentys, thirtys, sixtys, hundreds and thousands. And the lord of Rākshasas, Rāvana, who was stationed on the car, wroth, attacked Rāma in the conflict with maces and Musalas. And there again ensued a terrible conflict capable of making one's down stand on end. And the seven oceans were overwhelmed with the sound of maces, musalas, Parighas and gold feathered arrows. And those inhabiting the regions under the agitated oceans, all the Dānavas and thousands of Pannagas were greatly pained. And greatly shook the earth with her mountains, forests and gardens. The Sun was shorn of its resplendance and the wind blew very rough. Thereupon the celestials, with Gandharbas, Siddhas, great saints, Kinnaras and serpents were all worked up with anxiety. And beholding the dreadful encounter between Rāma and Rāvana capable of making people's down stand on end, the celestials with ascetics began to pray,—\"May good betide the Brahmins and cows, may people live in peace and may Rāghava defeat Rāvana, the lord of Rākshasas, in the conflict\". And the crowd of Gandharbas and Apsaras beholding that wonderful battle between Rāma and Rāvana, said,—\"The ocean resembleth the sky and the sky resembleth the ocean—forsooth this encounter between Rāma and Rāvana befits them only\". Thereupon Rāma of long-arms, the enhancer of the glory of Raghu's race, enraged, set his arrow, resembling a serpent, on his bow, and cut assunder Rāvana's head wearing shinning Kundalas. And that head in the presence of the inhabitants of the three regions fell down on the earth. Instantly there arose another head resembling the former; and it was speedily cut off by the light-handed Rāma. As soon as the second head was chopped off in the encounter by means of shafts another appeared again. And that was again severed by Rāma's shafts resembling thunder-bolts. And thus were severed hundred heads all equal in brilliance. But the end of Rāvana's life was not seen by him. Thereupon the heroic Rāghava, conversant with the use of all weapons, the enhancer of Kauçalyi's joy, began to reason within himself in various Ways,—\"Verily these are the arrows by which Māricha was killed, and Khara with Dushana was slain—Viradha was destroyed in the forest of Krauncha—the headless demon in the forest of Dandaka—Salas and mountains were broken—the ocean was agitated—and Vāli was killed;—I do not perceive the reason, why they are becoming fruitless when discharged at Rāvana\". Thinking thus Rāghava made himself ready In the conflict and began to shower arrows on Rāvana's breast. Thereupon Rāvana too, the lord of Rākshasas, seated in a car and highly enraged, assailed Rāma in the conflict with a downpour of maces and Musalas. That dreadful and huge conflict, capable of making hairs stand on end, continued for seven nights before the eyes of the celestials, Dānavas, Yakshas, Pisāchas, Uragas and serpents stationed in the sky, on the earth or on the mountain-tops. Neither for the night nor for the day, nor for a moment did the fight between Rāma and Rāvana cease. And beholding the conflict between Daçaratha's son and the lord of Rākshasas, and Rāghava's victory, the high-souled charioteer of the lord of the celestials spake speedily unto Rāma engaged in the conflict."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Thereupon Mātali, reminding him, spake unto Rāghava—\"Why dost thou, O hero, as if not knowing, fear him? Do thou, O lord, discharge at him the weapon obtained from the great Patriarch. The time for (his) destruction, as described by the celestials, hath arrived\". Being reminded by those words of Mātali, Rāma took up the flaming shaft, breathing as if like a serpent. The great Rishi Agastya first conferred this upon him. This is a huge and dreadful shaft given by Brahmā, and highly useful in battle. It was made by Brahmā of undecaying prowess for Indra and conferred by him upon the Lord of celestials desirous of acquiring victory. In its wings there is wind, in its head there is fire and the Sun, in its body there is the sky and in its weight there are the (hill) Meru and Mandara. It is resplendent by its own lustre, well feathered and adorned with gold—made of the essence of all objects and bright as the rays of the Sun. It is like the fire of dissolution enveloped in smoke—like the flaming serpent, capable of piercing men, serpents and horses and was swift-coursing. (It can) rend the gateways, Parighas and hills—is soaked in blood, dipped in marrow, and extremely dreadful. It is hard as the lightning—producing a dreadful sound, assailing various (divisions of the) army, creating terror unto all, dreadful and (as if) breathing like a serpent. It is terrible as the Death in the conflict and provides food always for the herons, vultures, cranes, jackals and the Rākshasas. It is the enhancer of the monkey-leaders' joy and the repressor of the Rākshasas and is feathered like unto a bird with many a picturesque wing. And the highly powerful Rāma, consecrating in accordance with the mantras laid down in the Vedas, that huge shaft—the foremost of all in the world, removing the fear of the Ikshwāku race, destroying the fame of the enemies and conducing to the joy of its own party, set it on his bow. And that excellent arrow being mounted on his bow by Rāghava all the animals were stricken with fear and the earth shook. And (Rāma) highly enraged, and greatly wary, suppressing (his breath) discharged that shaft at Rāvana—piercing to the vitals. (That Brahmā weapon) irrepressible as the thunder, dreadful as the Death and discharged by Rāma, fell down on Rāvana's breast. And that shaft, capable of bringing about death and gifted with velocity, when discharged, cleft the breast of the vicious-souled Rāvana. And that body-ending arrow, bathed in blood, stealing away the life of Rāvana, entered the earth. That shaft, slaying Rāvana, soaked in blood and successful, again entered the quiver461 humbly. And from his hand, who was deprived of his life, fell down instantly on earth his shafts and bow. And fell down on the earth from the chariot, the highly effulgent Rāvana, gifted with dreadful velocity and shorn of his life. And beholding him thus fallen down, the remaining night-rangers, deprived of their lord and stricken with terror fled away to various quarters. And beholding the destruction of the Ten-necked (demon) and the victory of Rāghava, the monkeys, fighting with trees, pursued them on all sides. And being assailed by the monkeys and having their countenances full of tears in consequence of their lord being slain they fled away to Lankā in fear. Thereupon the monkeys being greatly delighted roared out the victory of Rāma. The celestial bugle was sounded in the sky and there blew the excellent air carrying the celestial fragrance. Flowers were showered upon Rāma's car which was covered therewith. The celestials in the sky began to chaunt the glory of Rāma and praise him. And Rāvana, the dread of all people, being slain, the celestials with the Charanas were greatly delighted. And slaying that foremost of the Rākshasas, Rāma satisfied the desire of Sugriva, Angada and Bibhishana. Thereupon the celestials attained their peace, the quarters were delighted, the atmosphere was clear, calm air began to prevail all over the earth, and the Sun appeared in its full rays. Thereupon Sugriva, Bibhishana and Lakshmana, welcomed Rāma, of unmitigated prowess, singing his glory. And there appeared beautiful at the battle-field Rāma of firm promise, slaying his enemy and encircled by his army and friends, like unto the Lord of the celestials surrounded by the gods."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Beholding his brother defeated, slain and lying down on the battle-field, Bibhishana, overpowered with the weight of his grief, began to lament—\"O hero, well-known for thy prowess, wise and conversant with polity, thou wert used to excellent beds, why dost thou lie down on the earth, spreading (on the earth) thy long and actionless arms, always adorned with Angadas and being shorn of thy helmet having the resplendance of the Sun? O hero, thou hast come by what I had anticipated and what did not please thee who wert possessed by delusions. Prahasta, Indrajit, Kumbhakarna, Atikāya, Atiratha, Narāntaka, yourself and others—none of you paid heed, out of haughtines, to what I had said which hath now been brought about. Oh! the bridge of the pious hath been broken, the figure of the virtue hath been spoiled, the refuge of the strong and powerful hath disappeared and thou hast attained to the state of the heroes! The sun hath fallen down on the earth, the moon hath been shorn of its lustre, the fire hath been extinguished and virtue hath desisted from its action, this hero, the foremost of those using weapons, falling down on the earth. O thou the foremost of the Rākshasas lying down in the dust on the battle field like one asleep, whom else have these remaining (Rākshasas) deprived of their power and energy, got? The huge tree, of the lord of Rākshasas, having patience for its leaves, velocity for its flowers, the power of asceticism and heroism for its firm roots, hath been uprooted by the Rāghava wind. Mad-elephant-like Rāvana, having prowess for its tusk, family rank for its back bone, anger for its legs, and delightedness for its trunk, hath been laid low on the ground by the lion of the Ikshwāku race. The powerful Rākshasa-fire, having prowess and energy for its rays, angry breath for its smoke, own strength for its power of burning, hath been extinguished in battle by Rāma-*like cloud. The Rākshasa bull ever defeating others and powerful as the wind, having Rākshasas for its tail, hump and horns, and fickleness for its ears and eyes, hath been slain to-day by *Rāma-tiger\". Hearing these words, pregnant with sound reasonings from Bibhishana and beholding him overwhelmed with grief Rāma said,—\"(This lord of Rākshasas) of dreadful prowess hath not been slain in battle disabled. He is gifted with great prowess and energy and devoid of the fear of death.462 The heroes abiding by the virtues of the Kshatriyas, who fall at the battle field for enhancing their glory, when dead, should not be mourned for. This is not the time to mourn for him although possessed by death, by whom gifted with intellect, Indra with the three worlds was terrified in conflict. Besides success in battle is not perpetual; either one slays his enemy or meets with his destruction at his hands in the conflict This procedure of the Kshatryas was laid down by the ancient preceptors that a Kshatrya, when slain in battle should not be mourned for. Beholding this to be certain and attaining calmness, do thou be freed from thy sorrow and think what should be done now. Thereupon Bibhishana stricken with grief addressed the powerful son of the king speaking thus with words tending to his brother's well-being. \"Thou hast, like the ocean breaking down its banks, broken him down, who had not been ere this even defeated by Bāsava and the celestials. By him were conferred many a gift on those who wanted them, were enjoyed many a luxury, were maintained many a servant, distributed wealth unto friends and slain the enemies. He propitiated fire, performed great austerities, was conversant with the Vedas and the great performer of sacrifices. I desire to perform, by thy instructions, his becoming obsequies\". Being thus addressed by Bibhishana with piteous accents, the high-souled son of the lord of men, gifted with great energy, ordered him to perform his obsequies and said. \"With death our enmity hath terminated and our object hath been accomplished: he is as dear unto me as unto thee: perform (therefore) his funeral rites\"."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Beholding Rāvana slain by the high-souled Rāghava Rākshasees, stricken with grief, issued out of the inner appartments. Stricken with grief and with dishevelled hairs they rolled in the dust albeit prevented again and again like unto cows separated from their calves. And coming out by the northern gate along with the Rākshasas, entering the dreadful arena of battle and searching their slain lord the she-demons cried piteously—\"O lord, O husband, O our all\" and moved along the battle field soaked in blood and filled with headless corpses. With eyes full of tears and overwhelmed with the grief of their husband they began to move about like she-elephants without the lord of their herd. Thereupon they beheld there on the earth the huge-bodied and the highly powerful and effulgent Rāvana slain like red collyrium. And beholding their lord lying down on the battle-field they all fell on his body like creepers torn assunder. Some wept embracing him respectfully—some holding his feet and some placing themselves around his neck. And some taking up his hand rolled on the ground and some were beside themselves (with grief) beholding the slain (Rāvana's) countenance. And some placing her head on his lap, and beholding his face, wept, bathing it with tears like a lotus enveloped with snow. Seeing their husband Rāvana thus slain on the earth, they stricken with grief, bewailing again and again in sorrow, wept profusely. He by whom the king Vaisrabana was deprived of his flower car, who terrified the high-souled Gandharbas, ascetics and the celestials in battle field, who did not know of any fear from the Asuras, celestials and the Pannagas, hath now been overpowered by a man. He, whom the celestials, the Dānavas and the Rakshas could not slay, hath been slain in conflict by a man walking on foot. He, who was incapable of being killed by the celestials, Yakshas and Asuras, hath met with death like one devoid of prowess at the hands of a mortal\". Speaking in this wise, the she-demons, over-powered with sorrow, wept and bewailed again and again (saying),—\"Not hearing (the counsels) of thy friends, always pointing out thy welfare, thou didst bring Sitā for thy destruction as well as that of the Rākshasas. Although thy brother Bibhishana addressed thee with words pregnant with thy welfare—thou, for thy own destruction, out of thy misgivings, didst excite his anger and hast (now) seen (the result thereof). Hadst thou returned Sitā the daughter of the king of Mithilā to Rāma, this mighty and dreadful disaster, destroying the very root, would not have befallen us. Rāma's desire would have been encompassed—his friends would have been successful (through Bibhishana)—we would not been widowed and our enemies would not have got their desires fulfilled. By thee, Sitā was kept by force in captivity in a ruthless manner, and the Rākshasas, ourselves and thyself—all three equally have been slain. O foremost of the Rākshasas, forsooth this is not thy own folly—it is Accident that uniteth all things and it is Accident again that bringeth about destruction. O thou of huge arms—the destruction of the monkeys and the Rākshasas as well as that of thyself hath been brought about by Accident. When the course of accident is about to bring about result—wealth, desire, prowess or command—nothing is capable of with-standing it\". Thus wept piteously the wives of the lord of Rākshasas like unto so many she-elephants—rendered poorly, stricken with grief and with tears in their eyes."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "The foremost of the wives of the Rākshasa (king) bewailing piteously cast her looks poorly towards her husband. And beholding her Ten-necked husband slain by Rāma of inconcievable actions Mandodari bewailed there piteously,—\"O thou of huge arms! O younger brother of Baishravana! Even Purandara feared to stand before thee when enraged. The great Rishis—the far-famed Gandharbas and the Chāranas, fled away to different quarters in thy fear. And then (how) hast thou been overpowered in battle by Rāma who is a mere man? Why is it that thou art not ashamed of it, O king, O lord of the Rākshasas? Conquering the three worlds with thy prowess thou didst attain thy glory; and it is unbearable, that a man, ranging in the forest, hath slain thee. Thou, who art capable of assuming shapes at will, hast been slain in conflict by Rāma, in the city of Lankā unapproachable by men. I do not believe that thy destruction,—who hadst always been crowned with success, before the forces, is work of Rāma. (Methinks) Death (himself) came there in the shape of Rāma and spread illusions unconsciously for thy destruction, O thou of great strength. Or thou hast been slain by Vāsava—(no) what power has he got to face thee in the conflict gifted with great strength, prowess and energy and an enemy of the celestials as thou art? It is evident that the great ascetic Vishnu, having truth for his prowess—the soul of all beings, ever existing, without beginning, middle or end, greater than the great, the Preserver of the Nature, holding conch, discus and club, having Sribatsa463 on his breast, always beautiful, incapable of being conquered, without destruction, devoid of end, and the lord of all men, assuming this shape of a man and encircled by the celestials, assuming monkey shapes, hath for the behoof of mankind, slain (thee) the dreadful enemy of the gods with all (thy) family and Rākshasas. Subduing all thy passions, thou didst conquer the three worlds—remembering their grudge they have now over-powered thee. Rāma is not a man since he slew at Janasthāna thy brother Khara encircled by many a Rākshasa. We were sore-distressed when Hanumān, by his own prowess, entered the city of Lankā, incapable of being approached even by the celestials. And I prevented thee from creating enmity with Rāghava, but thou didst not pay heed to my words and this is the result (thereof). O foremost of Rākshasas—thou of a vicious understanding, for the destruction of thy wealth, thyself and thy relatives, thou didst suddenly cherish amour for Sitā, greater than (even) Arundhuti and Rohini. Forsooth thou didst perpetrate an unbecoming deed by distressing the adorable Sitā ever devoted unto her lord, an earth464 even unto Earth herself and a Sree465 even unto Sree herself. And having brought in a false guise from the solitary forest the sorrowful and chaste Sitā, having a blameless person, thou didst bring on the destruction of thy family. Thou didst fail to encompass thy desire for the company of Sitā. But now, forsooth, O my lord, thou hast been burnt down by her devotion who is devoted unto her husband.466 Thou wert not burnt down when thou didst captivate that middle-statured (damsel) whom fear all the celestials headed by Indra and Agni.467 O husband, (proper) time appearing the perpetrator gets the result of his vicious deeds: there is not the least doubt in this. The performer of the good receives good (result)—the perpetrator of the vicious (deeds) meets with bad (result). Bibhishana hath attained to happiness and thou hast met with this thy end. There are damsels in your seraglio far more beautiful than she but thou possessed by cupid couldst not perceive this. Maithilee is not my equal nor superior either in birth, beauty or accomplishments, but thou didst not perceive this by thy misgivings. Death doth not always visit all men without any cause—and Maithilee is the cause of thy death. And death, in consequence of Maithilee, hath taken thee far away. And she, shorn of all sorrow, shall enjoy in the company of Rāma, and I, of limited piety, am now sunk in the the ocean of grief. Roaming at large with thee in a car unequalled in beauty on the hill Kailāça, Mandara, Maru, in the garden of Chaitraratha and ail other celestial gardens, beholding many a country, wearing variegated clothes and garlands, I have been deprived of all pleasures and enjoyments, O hero, by thy death. And I am a widow now. O fie on fickle fortune! O king, in lustre of countenance thou art like the Sun, in grace like the Moon, in beauty like the lotus; thou art graceful, O thou having excellent brows; thou hast got excellent skin, high nose and thy countenance is graced with a brilliant crown and Kundalas. Oh how beautiful, thou didst look with various garlands when thy eye whirled with intoxication on the drinking ground and how beautiful were thy smiles, O lord. Thy countenance doth not shine now—being severed with Rāma's shafts, bathed in a pool of blood, having thy back-bone and brain deranged and covered with the dust raised by the wheels of the chariots. Alas! by my ill-luck I have attained to that after state making me a widow which I did never think of. My father is the king of Dānavas, my husband the lord of Rākshasas, and my son the subduer of Sakra. I was greatly proud of this and always confident that my protectors were undaunted, dreadful, repressors of the enemies and famous for their strength and manliness. O ye foremost of the Rākshasas, how could this fear from man overwhelm you all who were so powerful? (This thy body) is cool, green like Indraneela, high like a huge mountain, and adorned with Keyura, Angada, jewels and garlands of flowers. It was graceful in places of enjoyments and incapable of being looked at in the field of battle. It was brilliant, being decked with ornaments like unto clouds accompanied by lightnings. And this thy person hath been pierced with shafts to-day; (and knowing) that it is not easy of attainment for me I am incapable of embracing (it), covered with shafts piercing through the very vitals. O king (this thy body) green-hued (but now) blood-red is now lying on the ground like unto a mountain shattered with thunder-bolts. That thou wouldst be slain by Rāma was like a dream, but it hath proved true! Thou wert like death unto Death himself, why hast thou been possessed by him then? Thou wert the enjoyer of the three worlds' wealth and dread unto them; thou wert the conqueror of the deities presiding over various quarters; thou didst shake Sankara (himself)—thou wert the subduer of the proud and thy prowess was well-known; thou didst repress the people and slay many a pious man—thou didst, by thy prowess, use to give vent to haughty words before the enemies; thou wert the maintainer of thy kinsmen and servants and the slayer of many perpetrating dreadful deeds; thou wert the destroyer of thousands of celestials, Dānavas and Yakshas; thou wert the subduer of Nivata Kavachas in the encounter; thou didst hinder the performance of many sacrifices and wert the protector of thy relatives; thou wert the obstructer of pious observances, creator of illusions in conflict and thou didst bring away from hither and thither the daughters of the celestials, demons and men; thou didst aggrieve the wives of thy enemies; thou wert the leader of thy own men, the protector of the island of Lankā and the performer of many a dreadful deed; thou didst confer upon us the enjoyment of many a pleasure—and wert the foremost of car-warriors. Beholding such a husband slain by Rāma, I am, deprived of my dear lord, still maintaining my being; (forsooth) my heart is very hard. O lord of Rākshasas, used ere to many a valuable bed, why art thou sleeping on earth covered with dust? When my son Indrajit was slain by Lakshmana in conflict I was greatly pained—but to-day I am slain. Deprived of my friends and relatives, separated from thee O my lord, deprived from the enjoyment of many pleasures I shall lament for thee perpetually. Thou hast, O king, reached the way, long and hard to be treaded—do thou take me, who am stricken with grief and who shall not be able to live without thee. Why dost thou wish to go leaving me behind who have been rendered poorly? Why dost thou not welcome me, unfortunate and poor, who am bewailing? Why art thou not angry, lord, beholding me, having put off my veil, walk out on foot by the city-gate? O beloved of thy wives, do thou behold thy wives—who have thrown off their veils. Why art thou not angry seeing them all come out (of the city)? I was thy companion in sports, my lord; I long for having thee; why art thou not consoling and welcoming me? O king, being imprecated by those damsels, not one, devoted to their husbands, pious and ever engaged in attending upon their superiors, who had been widowed by thee, thou hast been overpowered by thy enemy. The carte, proceeding from them who had been ill-treated by thee, hath borne fruit. O king, the saying, that the tears of chaste damsels do not uselessly fall on the ground, hath been verified (here) forsooth. O king, conquering the worlds with thy prowess, how couldst thou, always honored by the king, cherish the vile desire of stealing away women? Taking away Rāma and Lakshmana from the hermitage by an illusionary deer, thou didst steal away Rāma's spouse. I remember to have never heard thee lament in battle. Forsooth, it is our misfortune and the sign of impending death (that thou didst do this) conversant as thou art with the past, present and future. Beholding the daughter of the king of Mithilā brought (in the city of Lankā) what, thy younger brother Bibhishana, thinking and sighing, said, hath now proved true, O thou of long-arms. This destruction of the leading Rākshasas hath proceeded from the disaster arising from thy anger and lust. For thy (vicious) deeds all our good fortune is lost—(and from them) hath proceeded the great disaster exterminating the race. And by thee all the Rākshasa families have been deprived of their lords. Thou, well-known for thy strength and manliness, art not worthy of being grieved by me. On account of my effeminate nature my understanding is possessed by sorrow. Carrying thy pious and iniquitous deeds thou hast attained to thy own state—I am only lamenting for me who have been sorry for thy destruction. O Ten-necked one, thou didst not bear the words of thy friends and brothers, who spoke those well meaning words out of affection. Thou didst not obey the words uttered by Bibhisana, duly and mildly, pregnant with meaning and reasoning and tending to thy welfare. Maddened with thy own prowess thou didst not hear the words of Māricha, Kumbhakarna as well as those of my father—and this is the result thereof. O thou resembling the red clouds, O thou wearing yellow cloth and excellent Angada, stretching thy person on the ground why art thou in the long run bathed in blood? Why dost thou not, like one asleep, welcome me who am stricken with grief? I am the grand-daughter of the highly powerful Rākshasa Sumāli who never flies away from the field of battle: why dost thou not welcome me? Rise up! rise up! why dost thou lie down (on this occasion of) new discomfiture? To-day have the rays of the Sun entered fearlessly the city of Lankā. The Parigha, by which, brilliant as the rays of the Sun, thou didst distress the enemies in conflict, which was always adored by thee like the thunder of the wielder of thunder-bolt, which slew many in battle, and which was adorned with golden nets, now lieth shattered into thousand pieces by arrows. Why dost thou lie on the battle-field embracing her like your beloved spouse? Why dost thou not wish to welcome me like one not beloved unto thee? Oh fie on this heart of mine which is not sundered into thousand (pieces) albeit distressed with the grief of thy death!\" Bewailing thus, she, with profuse tears in her eyes, and with her heart overflowing with affection, became senseless. And being beside herself she flung herself on Rāvana's breast, like unto the bright lightning appearing on red evening clouds. Thereupon the other wives, of Rāvana, greatly distressed and weeping, and raising her up who was greatly weeping, began to console her saying:—\"Dost thou not know, O worshipful dame, that the life of beings is very uncertain, and with adverse circumstances even the royal fortune becometh fickle?\" Being thus accosted she again wept aloud, bathing with tears her breast and beautiful countenance. In the meantime Rāma said to Bibhisana,—\"Do thou perform the funeral ceremonies of thy brother and console his wives\". Whereto the intelligent Bibhisana replied with the following words—pointing out wealth and piety, and judging by his understanding what is proper. \"I do not think it proper to perform his cremation ceremony who had renounced all pious deeds, was wicked, cruel, liar and who had ravished others' wives. He is my enemy in the shape of a brother ever engaged in doing injury unto others—and Rāvana is not worthy of my adoration albeit he is adorable by virtue of his being my elder brother. O Rāma, perhaps people of this earth will call me cruel but they will again recognise my act as good when they will hear of his vicious deeds\". Hearing those words, Rāma, the foremost of the pious and conversant with the skill of speech, greatly delighted, spoke unto Bibhishana (equally) skilled in speech,—\"It behoveth me to encompass thy welfare since by thy help I have gained the victory. O lord of Rākshasas, forsooth, thou shouldst hear my well-meaning words. Although this night-ranger perpetrated many vicious and impious deeds, still he was ever powerful, heroic and strong in warfare. I have heard that this high-souled Rāvana, gifted with strength and a dread unto all people, was not defeated (even) by the celestials headed by the performer of a hundred sacrifices. Enmity extendeth up to death—so it hath ended; there is no necessity (of carrying it on). Do thou (therefore) perform his cremation ceremony—he is unto thee as he is unto me. O thou of long-arms it behoveth thee to perform, speedily with due rites and religious ceremonies, his funeral ceremony—thou shalt be the object of praise (unto people)\". Hearing the words of Rāghava, Bibhishana hastened on and began to make arrangements for the cremation of his slain brother Rāvana. And entering the city of Lankā, Bibhishana, the lord of Rākshasas, speedily got out Rāvana's Agnihotra,468 carts, brass utensils, fire, (and brought) Jajakas,469 sandal-wood, other woods, essences, Agura, other fragrant substances, precious stones, pearls and corals. Thereupon arriving immediately accompanied by Rākshasas and Malyavāna he engaged in the performance of cremation ceremony. Thereupon the twice-born ones, with tears in their eyes, covered the Rākshasa-king Rāvana's body, with a silken cloth and placed it on a golden celestial litter. With the sound of various bugles they began to chaunt his praise. And taking up this litter adorned with various charming paintings and flags and carrying fire woods, all the Rākshasas headed by Bibhishana proceeded towards the South.470 The Brahmins, versed in Yayur Veda and with burning fire in their hands, proceeded and were followed by the attendants. And the damsels of the seraglio followed speedily leaping (being ever unused to walking). And placing Rāvana on the cremation ground, they, greatly stricken with grief, prepared the funeral pyre according to due rites with sandalwoods, Padmakas,471 Ushiras472 and sandal and spread an antelope-skin thereon. They (then) performed the excellent obsequies of the manes of the lord of Rākshasas. And raising an altar at the south-east corner they placed fire at the proper place. They then poured curd and clarified butter upon (Rāvana's) shoulders. And placing Sakata on his legs, Ulukhala473 on his thighs, and the brass untensils, Arunis and Musals in their proper places, they celebrated (the obsequies of his manes). Thereupon slaying beasts according to the rites laid down in Sāstras and pointed out by the great saints, the Rākshasas (made a coverlet dipped in their marrow and clarified butter) and placed it on the face of the lord of Rākshasas. And decking Rāvana with fragrant garlands and various clothes, the friends, of Bibhishana, with depressed heart and tears in their eyes, showered dried paddy (on his person). And Bibhishana according to due rites put fire to his (funeral pyre). Bathing and with wetted cloth, offering duly linseed and sacrificial grass mixed with water and consoling (Rāvana's) wives again and again, he entreated them to go back. They then entered the city. And those damsels having entered the city, Bibhishana, the lord of Rākshasas, approaching Rāma, stood by his side gently. And Rāma too, along with his army, Sugriva and Lakshmana, was greatly delighted after slaying his enemy like unto the wielder of thunder-bolt after slaying (the demon) Vitra. Thereupon leaving aside his bow with arrows, and the huge armour conferred by Mahendra and renouncing ire after the destruction of his enemy Rāma assumed gentle mein."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Beholding the destruction of Rāvana the celestials, Gandharbas and Dānavas ascending their respective cars went away chanting this excellent theme. And talking of Rāvana's dreadful destruction, Rāghava's prowess, the excellent warfare of the monkeys, the counsels of Sugriva, the devotion and prowess of the Wind-God's son and Lakshmana and Sitā's devotion unto her husband, those high souled ones, delighted, repaired to their respective quarters. And Rāghava, having long arms, permitting the charioteer to take back the celestial car bright as the sky sent by Indra, honoured him greatly. And being commanded by Rāghava Mātali, the charioteer of Sakra taking the celestial car, rose up in the welkin. And that charioteer rising up into the celestial region, Rāghava, the foremost of car-warriors, greatly delighted, embraced Sugriva. And embracing Sugriva, bowed unto by Lakshmana and worshipped by the monkey he repaired to the camp of his soldiers. Thereupon Kākutstha spoke unto Lakshmana—the son of Sumitrā gifted with auspicious marks who was near him—\"O gentle one, take this Bibhishana to the city of Lankā ever devoted and attached unto us, and who had done us good. This is my great desire that I may behold Bibhishana the younger brother of Rāvana installed on the throne of Lankā\". Being thus addressed by the high-souled Rāghava, the son of Sumitrā, saying—\"So be it\" and greatly delighted, brought a golden jar. And placing that jar at the hands of the lord of monkeys, that one, gifted with great energy, ordered them to bring water from the Ocean. And repairing speedily those excellent monkeys came back with water from the ocean. And taking that jar and placing him on an excellent seat Saumitri with that water sprinkled Bibhishana as king of Lankā in the presence of all the Rākshasas, at Rāma's command. And (Lakshmana) encircled by friends sprinkling him according to rites laid down in the Vedas, all the Rākshasas, devoted unto him, his counsellors and the monkeys attaining incomparable delight, sang the glory of Rāma. And beholding Bibhishana the lord of Rākshasas installed in the city of Lankā, Rāghava along with Lakshmana attained to an excess of delight. And consoling his subjects he went to Rāma. And the monkey citizens, delighted, brought him curd, fried grain, sweetmeats, fried paddy and flowers. And taking all those things indicating auspiciousness, he, irrepressible and gifted with energy, conferred them upon Rāghava and Lakshmana. And beholding Bibhisbana crowned with prosperity and success, Rāma accepted them, all for his satisfaction. Thereupon Rāma spoke unto the heroic monkey Hanumān, resembling a a mountain and standing before him humbly with folded hands, saying—\"O gentle one, obtaining permission from the king Bibhishana, do thou enter the city of Lankā and enquire after Maithili's welfare. Do thou, O foremost of monkeys, inform Vaidehi of the destruction of Rāvana in conflict after communicating unto her mine health as well as that of Lakshmana and Sugriva. O lord of monkeys, it behoveth thee to return with the tidings of Vaidehi after informing her of this pleasant news."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Being thus commanded, Hanumān, the son of Maruta, worshipped of the night-rangers, entered the city of Lankā. Entering the city with Bibishana's permissiom, Hanumān, again permitted, entered the Briksha Vatika.474 And entering there duly, the monkey, who was already known to Sitā, espied her, having her person not cleansed, like Rohini, oppressed by Rāhu, sitting at the foot of a tree, devoid of joy and encircled by she-demons. And approaching her and bowing unto her, he stood there humbly and unmoved. And beholding the highly powerful Hanumān arrived there the worshipful dame stood silent for sometime and then recognising him became greatly delighted. And beholding her gentle countenance, Hanumān, the best of monkeys, began to relate unto her what Rāma had said—\"O Vaidehi, it is all well with Rāma, Sugriva and Lakshmana. He hath enquired after thy welfare. He hath accomplished his end subduing his enemies—and his enemy is slain. O worshipful dame, the powerful Rāvana hath been slain by Rāma, helped by Bibhishana and accompanied by the monkeys and Lakshmana. I do relate unto thee this pleasant news, O worshipful dame; I do again delight thee; it is by thy grace, O thou conversant with piety, O Sitā, victory hath been gained. Do thou be consoled and relieved of thy anxiety. The enemy Rāvana hath been slain and the city of Lankā, hath been brought under submission. (Rāma said),—'For discomfitting thy enemy a bridge was constructed over the sea by me who was determined and who did not sleep (for days) and thus my promise hath been fulfilled. Do thou not be afraid for living in Rāvana's abode for I have placed at Bibhishana's hands the sovereignty of Lankā. Do thou be consoled thinking as if that thou art living in thy own house. To behold thee, Bibhishana, delighted, shall soon proceed\". Being thus accosted the worshipful Sitā, having a moon-like countenance, and her voice choked in delight, could not utter any thing. And beholding Sitā incapable of replying the foremost of monkeys said,—\"What art thou thinking of, O worshipful dame? Why art thou not welcoming me?\" Being thus addressed by Hanumān, Sitā, ever treading the paths of morality, greatly delighted, replied with words suppressed by tears. \"Hearing this pleasant news concerning the victory of my husband—and being brought under the control of joy I am speechless for sometime. O monkey, I do not perceive any such thing which I can confer upon thee, in return, for this pleasant news. I do dot see any such thing on this earth which can match thy pleasant tidings and bestowing which upon thee I may be happy. Silver, gold, or diverse jewels or the kingdom of the three worlds—nothing is a becoming return for thy speech\". Being thus addressed by Vaidehi the monkey replied—folding his hands with delight and stationed before Sitā,—' O blameless damsel, forsooth this excellent speech becometh thee, who is ever engaged in the welfare of thy husband and ever desirous of his victory. I do consider, O worshipful dame, these words of thine, far greater than the wealth, jewels or even the sovereignty over the celestials. Forsooth I have gained the kingdom of the celestials and other things since I have beheld Rāma slay his enemy, victorious and peaceful. Hearing those words of (Hanumān) Maithili the daughter of king Janaka spoke unto the Wind-god's son far more excellent words—\"Thou art capable of speaking words, chaste, pleasant and significant of eight sorts of knowledge. Thou art the praise-worthy son of the Wind-god and greatly virtuous; strength, prowess, heroism, knowledge of Sāstras, noble-mindedness, energy, forgiveness, patience, endurance, humility and many other excellent qualities crown thee\". Thereupon not being elated the least, he again, humbly folding his hands with delight and stationed before Sitā, said—\"If dost thou permit me I may slay all these she-demons who had tortured thee before, distressed thee in the forest of Açoka, stricken with grief of thy lord, and who are cruel, have grim eyes and who perpetrate always dreadful deeds. O worshipful dame, I have heard that these grim-visaged she-demons distressed thee greatly with harsh words at the command of Rāvana. I desire to slay all these dreadful, crooked, ugly (she-demons) having fearful eyes, meting out unto them various punishments. I wish to slay all these she-demons, who had used harsh words and had always offended thee, stricking them with fists, fingers, arms, dreadful knee-joints, teeth, chopping off their ears and noses, and pulling them by their hairs: do thou confer upon me this permission. O far famed lady, I shall slay them by these various means, by whom, dreadful as they are, thou hadst been distressed before\". Being thus addressed by Hanumān, she, ever kind unto the poor, thinking and meditating, said to him—\"O foremost of monkeys, why art thou angry with these she-slaves, who subject as they are to the command of their lord, have done this in accordance with another's order. For my adverse fortune and vicious deeds perpetrated in another birth I have been subject to such a plight and been suffering the consequence thereof. Do thou not speak thus, O thou of huge arms. Such is the course of Fortune. Forsooth by my ill-luck I have met with (this misfortune). I forgive, out of pity, all these she-servants of Rāvana; they used to torture me at the command of that Rākshasa. And he being slain they shall not repress me any longer, O son of the Wind-god. Do thou, O monkey, hear of a Sloka, related in a Purāna and pregnant with religious import, which was uttered by a boar to a tiger. 'No one taketh upon himself the iniquity of a perpetrator of vicious deeds. So it behoveth the pious crowned with an excellent character to observe the rules (of piety). So it is proper to show compassion even upon those who perpetrate crimes and are worthy of being slain. Who is there who doth not commit a crime? It is not proper to act cruelly even by them who take delight in killing men, although they commit various iniquitous deeds.'\" Being thus addressed by Sitā, Hanumān, skilled in speech, spoke unto the blameless Rāma's spouse, saying—\"Thou art the worthy spouse of Rāma, religiously wedded and crowned with many qualities. Permit me, O worshipful dame, to proceed where Rāghava is\". Being thus accosted by Hanumān, Vaidehi, the daughter of king Janaka, said,—\"I wish to see my lord, ever fond of those who are devoted unto him\". Hearing these words, the high-minded Hanumān, the son of Maruta, pleasing Maithili said—\"Thou shalt behold Rāma, having a countenance like the full moon, with Lakshmana, surrounded by his friends and having his enemies slain as Sachi beholdeth Indra the king of the celestials\". Addressing these words unto Sitā appearing like Sree herself the highly effulgent Hanumān returned where Rāghava was. Thereupon Hanumān, the foremost of monkeys, related duly all what did the daughter of king Janaka say unto Rāghava resembling the lord of the celestials."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Thereupon bowing unto Rāma, the foremost of bow-men, having eyes resembling lotus-petals, the highly wise monkey said,—\"It behoveth thee now to see Maithilee, stricken with grief for whom thou didst initiate all these works and the fruit whereof hath now been attained. Hearing of thy victory Maithilee, possessed by grief and having eyes full of tears, expressed her desire to see thee. And I was told by her, confident of her previous trust, with profuse tears in her eyes,—\"I wish to see my husband\". Being addressed by Hanumān, Rāma the foremost of the pious being bathed in tears, engaged instantly in meditation. Thereupon sighing hard and casting his looks upon the ground he spoke unto Bibhishana resembling clouds, who was near him. \"Do thou speedily bring Sitā here—the daughter of the king of Mithilā—bathed, sprinkled with celestial paste and adorned with celestial ornaments\". Being thus addressed by Rāma, Bibhishana hastened on and entering the inner appartment sent information unto Sitā through the female attendants. And beholding the great Sitā, the graceful lord of Rākshasas—Bibhishana, humbly and placing his joined palms on his crown, said,—\"O Vaidehi, may good betide thee; sprinkled with celestial paste and adorned with celestials ornaments do thou ascend this car; thy husband wisheth to see thee\". Being thus addressed Vaidehi replied unto Bibhishana,—\"O lord of Rākshasas, without bathing even I wish to see my husband\". Hearing those words Bibhishana replied,—\"It behoveth thee to do what thy lord Rāma hath said\". Whereto the chaste Maithilee, regarding her husband as God and filled with devotion unto her husband, replied saying \"So be it\". Thereupon placing Sitā, bathed, performing the due rites wearing valuable clothes and adorned with valuable ornaments, on a palanquin, carried by many a capable Rākshasa, brought her (unto Rāma). Thereupon approaching the high-souled Rāma, who, being informed of (Bibhishana's approach) was engaged in meditation, Bibhishana bowing down and delighted communicated unto him the arrival of Sitā. And hearing of her arrival who had lived long in the abode of the Rākshasa Rāghava, the slayer of enemies attained (simultaneously) to anger, delight and depression. And considering Sitā, who was in the patanquin, over-whelmed with grief, Rāghava delighted addressed Bibhishana with the following words. \"O lord of Rākshasas, O gentle (king), O thou ever engaged in encompassing my success, do thou speedily bring Vaidehi nearer to me\". Hearing these words of Rāghava, Bibhishana, conversant with piety speedily cleared (the people out of that place). And attendants with armours and head-dresses on and with cane and drums in their hands began to move about driving away the crowd thereform. And the crowds of bears, monkeys and Rākshasas being driven on all sides began to fly at a distance. And they being thus driven there arose a huge noise resembling that of the ocean when agitated by the wind. Beholding the monkeys driven on all sides and troubled, Rāghava out of anger and compassion prevented him. And thereupon as if burning (every thing) with his angry eyes Rāma addressed the highly intelligent Bibhishana with the following angry words—\"Why dost thou insult me by destroying all these? Do thou remove their anxiety—they are all my own men. Neither the houses, clothes, walls nor reception like these are the veils of women. There is no sin consequent upon seeing women in danger, difficulty, war, Svyambara475 sacrifice and marriage. She is now in great danger and difficulty—there is no sin in seeing her specially in my presence. Therefore leaving behind the palanquin let her come here on foot and let the monkeys behold Vaidehi in my presence\". Being thus addressed by Rāma, Bibbishana, being sorry, humbly brought Sitā near him. There-upon bearing Rāma's accents, Lakshmana, Sugriva and the monkey Hanumān were greatly sorry. As if hiding herself in her own person in shame Maithili, following Bibhishana, approached her husband. And she, having a gentle countetiance and always regarding her husband as her god, fixed her looks upon her lord's face out of surprise, joy and love. And beholding the gentle countenance of her dearest lord, resembling the full moon she removed her mental distress. Thereupon she appeared (beautiful) having the countenance of the clear moon."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Beholding Maithili standing humbly by him, Rāma began to give vent to his pent-up feelings—\"O gentle one, destroying all the enemies in the arena of battle I have subdued thy enemy—I have done all that can be accomplished by manliness. I have reached the other end of my anger, rubbed off (the insult) for my spouse being taken away by the enemy and have killed simultaneously my disgrace and enemy. My manliness hath been displayed to-day, my labour hath been crowned with success and to-day I have fulfilled my promise by my own prowess. That accidental misfortune, under the influence whereof thou wert carried away by the fickle-minded Rākshasa in my absence, hath been subdued to-day by me, a man. What is the use of his manliness, who when insulted, cannot remove it? Even if he be a great man he may be called mean. The praise-worthy works of Hanumān—the crossing of the deep and the devastation of Lankā, have been crowned with success to-day. The labour of Sugriva with his army, who displayed valour in the encounter and gave me good counsels, hath borne fruit to-day. To-day also the labour of Bibhishana hath borne fruit—who renouncing his brother, devoid of all good qualities, came to my side\". Hearing those words of Rāma, Sitā began to look wistfully like a hind, with eyes full of tears. And beholding his beloved spouse near him and afraid of popular ignominy his heart was broken into two. Thereupon he spoke unto the exquisitely beautiful Sitā, in the midst of the monkeys and Rākshasas, having eyes resembling lotus-petals and black and curling hairs, saying,—\"As the southern quarter, incapable of being got at by the people, was conquered by the self-controlled great ascetic Agastya, so for thee slaying Rāvana, I, (always) anxious to have honour, have removed my insult—as is the duty of a man. May good betide thee—do thou know that all my labour, in the battle-field, backed by the prowess of my friends, is for thee, To uphold the dignity of my well-known family, to remove the ignominy consequent upon thy being stolen away as well as to wipe off my own insult I have encompassed this. I have suspected thy character; thou, (therefore) standing before me, art distressing me like unto a lamp before one who is subject to an eye-disease. Do thou therefore proceed, daughter of king Janaka, wherever thou likest to one of these ten quarters. I permit thee, O gentle one. I have nothing to do with thee. What powerful man, born in a high family, take back his wife considering her as friend out of lust, who hath lived long in another's house? Thou wert taken by Rāvana on his lap, beheld by him with sinful eyes; how can I, taking thee back, bring disgrace upon my great family? The object, with which I have gained thee back, hath been accomplished. I have got no attachment for thee—do thou go wherever thou wishest, gentle one. I speak these unto thee impelled by my sense of duty. If thou wishest thou mayest live with Lakshmana, Bharata or Satrughna or with Sugriva or Rākshasa Bibhishana. Do thou settle, O Sitā, where you may find thy own pleasure. O Sitā, (I do not think) Rāvana hath overlooked thee, who lived in his house, beholding thee so graceful and beautiful\". Thereupon hearing those unpleasant words from her beloved (husband) Sitā, always sensitive and who had never heard such unpleasant words, trembling like a creeper torn by the trunk of an elephant, began to weep shedding tears profusely."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Being this addressed by Rāghava, enraged, with those harsh words Sitā was greatly pained. And hearing those words of her lord, unheard of, before the great assembly Maithili was greatly humiliated with shame. As if entering unto her own person (with shame) and greatly pained with these arrow-like words the daughter of king Janaka began to shed tears. Thereupon wiping the tears off her countenance, she with sorrowful words, addressed her husband—\"Why dost thou, O hero, like a common man addressing an ordinary woman, make me hear these harsh and unbecoming words painful unto ears? O thou of long arms, I am not what thou hast taken me to be. Do thou believe me I do swear by my own character. Seeing the ordinary women thou art distrusting the whole sex. Do thou renounce this suspicion since thou hast tried me. O lord, though my person was touched by another—but it was not in my power; nor was it an wilful act (of mine); accident is to blame in this. My heart is under my control and that is in thee;—and what could I do of my body which was subject to another and of which I was not the mistress. O thou the conferrer of honour—our affection towards one another was increased by our living continually for a long time; even then if thou hast not been able to understand me I am ruined for ever. O king, when the great hero Hanumān was despatched by thee to Lankā to see me why didst thou not renounce me then? Hadst thou deputed the monkey with that message I would have renounced my life there and then, O hero. Thou wouldst not have been required to undergo this toil at the risk of thy own life and giving unnecessary trouble to thy friends. O foremost of kings, being subject to ire—thou dost not perceive anything but womanhood in me, like an ordinary man. Although I am known to have a father but in fact I am born of the earth. Thou dost not sufficiently honour my character, O thou conversant with characters. Thy marriage with me in boyhood shall be disproved and thou art not sufficiently considering all my devotion and good conduct unto thee\". Saying thus with accents choked in tears and weeping Sitā spoke unto Lakshmana, poorly and engaged in meditation. \"Make a funeral pyre for me, O Saumitri, that is the only remedy for this disaster. Being thus branded with an unfounded stigma I do not like to keep my life. To adopt the proper course for me who had been renounced before this assembly by my disaffected husband I shall enter this\". Being thus addressed by Vaidehi, Lakshmana, the slayer of enemies, being possessed by anger, looked towards Rāghava. And understanding Rāma's intention by gestures and at his command the powerful Saumitri prepared a funeral pyre. None dared there request, speak with or even look at Rāma like unto Death at the time of dissolution. Thereupon circumambulating Rāma, standing with his head down, Vaidehi approached the burning fire. And bowing unto the celestials and Brāhmanas, Maithili, with folded hands, spoke before the fire:—\"As my heart hath never gone away from Rāghava, may thou protect me, O fire, the witness of the people. As Rāghava considereth me vile, who have got a pure character, may fire, the witness of the people, protect me on all sides\". Saying this and going round the fire, Vaidehi, with undaunted heart, entered the flaming fire. The great assembly there, young and old, overwhelmed with grief, saw Maithili enter the flaming fire. And (Sitā) resembling the burning gold entered the flaming fire in the presence of all people. All beheld Sitā, having expansive eyes, enter fire like unto a golden altar. The ascetics, celestials and Gandharbas saw that great damsel enter fire like unto a full oblation in the sacrifice. And beholding her fallen into the fire like unto Vasudhārā, sanctified by Mantras in a sacrifice, all the females began to weep. And the three worlds—the celestials, Gandharbas and Dānavas saw her fallen like unto a celestial from the heaven when imprecited. She having entered the fire, lamentations, unheard of before, rose from all sides from the Rākshasas and monkeys."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Hearing the lamentations (of the Rākshasas and monkeys) the virtuous-souled Rāma, with a poor heart and having his eyes full of tears, engaged in meditation for some time. Thereupon the king Vaisrāvana, Yama with his progenitors, the thousand-eyed lord of the celestials, Varuna, the lord of water, the three-eyed graceful Mahādeva—the rider of bull, Brahmā the creator of the world and the foremost of those conversant with the knowledge of Brahma—all these arriving at the city of Lankā in their cars bright as the rays of the sun, approached Rāghava. Thereupon raising up their huge hands, decked with various ornaments and folding them, those foremost of the celestials said unto Rāghava—\"O lord, thou art the preserver of all the worlds and the foremost of the wise, why dost thou neglect Sitā entering into fire? Why dost thou not understand thyself the foremost of the celestials? Thou wert before the Patriarch of all Vasus,476 by the name of Kratadhāma. And thou art thyself, O lord, the creator of the three worlds. Thou art the eighth of the Rudras477 and the fifth of the Sādkyas;478 the Açwinis are thy two ears and the sun and the moon are thy eyes. O slayer of enemies, thou appearest at the begining and the end of the creation. Why dost thou neglect Vaidehi like an ordinary man?\" Being thus addressed by the deities presiding over quarters, Rāghava, the lord of people and the foremost of the pious, spoke unto those leading celestials, saying:—\"I know myself to be man—Rāma, the son of Daçaratha. Let the great Patriarch tell me, who I am and whence I have come\". Thereupon Brahmā, the foremost of those conversant with the knowledge of Brahma, spoke unto Kākutstha, who had spoken thus, saying,—\"Do thou hear my true words, O thou having truth for thy prowess. O lord, thou art the great and effulgent, Nārāyana holding discus and mace; thou art the boar having one tusk; thou hast conquered the past, present and future; thou art undecaying and without end, O Rāghava; thou art the great virtue of the pious—thou art the propounder of all laws and art four-armed; thou art the holder of bow of time—the subduer of senses—the excellent Purusha (person), unconquerable by sins; thou art Vishnu holding dagger, Krishna and of incomparable strength; thou art the army, the minister—the universe—the understanding, forgiveness and control of passions; thou art the creation and destruction; Upendra and the slayer of (demon) Madhu; thou art the creator of Indra; thou art Mahendra; thou hast a lotus-like navel and thou art the slayer of enemies. The celestials and the great saints style thee as the refuge of those who seek for shelter. Thou art the foremost of Vedas with its thousand branches and hundred regulations. Thou art thyself the creator of the three worlds, O lord. Thou art the refuge of the Siddhas479 and Sādhyas, thou art the Purvaja,480 the sacrifice, Vashatkar,481 Om482 and Parātpara.483 No one is conversant with thy birth and destruction—thou art manifest in all creatures—cows and Brahmins—in all quarters, in the sky, in the mountain, and in the river. Thou art gifted with thousand legs, thousand heads and thousand eyes. Thou dost uphold all creatures, the earth and all the mountains. Thou appearest like the great serpent in the water underneath the earth. O Rāma, thou dost uphold three creations—the celestials, the Gandharbas and the Dānavas. O Rāma—I am thy heart, the worshipful Swaraswati (Goddess of learning) is thy tongue and all other celestials, lord, created by Brahmā are thy down. The closing of thy eye is the night and the opening is the day. The Vedas are significant of thy desire and the control thereof—none hath got independent existence but thee. The whole universe is thy body, the earth is thy patience, the fire is thy anger—the sun and the moon are thy delight; thou hast got Sreebatsha (a peculiar curl of hair); thou didst before tread the three worlds with thy three foot steps; thou didst get the dreadful Bāli bound and make Mahendra king; Sitā is Lakshmi and thou art Krishna and Vishnu the Preserver of people. For Rāvana's destruction thou hast assumed the human shape. Thou hast accomplished that work of ours, O thou the foremost of the pious. O Rāma, Rāvana hath been slain. Do thou go up to heaven delighted. Sure is thy godly energy and never goes for nothing thy prowess. O Rāma, never is fruitless thy view and the chanting of thy glory. And always successful shall be these persons on earth who shall be devoted unto thee. Those who shall be devoted unto thee at one with Purāna484 and the excellent Purasha,485 shall attain all their desires both in this world and the next. Those persons shall never be unsuccessful both in this world and the next who shall chant this theme—excellent, instinct with the knowledge of Brahmā and describing the old history."

With the daughter of the king Janaka, the receiver487 of sacrificial offerings, being incarnate, rose up. And carrying on his lap Vaidehi, wearing a red cloth, resembling the newly risen sun, adorned with ornaments of burning gold—having black curling hairs and decked with fresh garments, Bibhābasu gave her unto Rāma. Thereupon the Deity of Fire, the witness of the people, spoke unto Rāma, saying—\"O Rāma, here is thy Vaidehi—no sin hath visited her. Neither by words, mind, understanding nor eyes, she, good-natured and beautiful—hath deviated from thee who hath got a good character and is heroic. She was in the solitary forest separated from thee, poorly and having no control over herself and hence she was carried away by the Rākshasa Rāvana having enough prowess in him. Although shut up in the inner appartment—well protected and guarded by the dreadful she-demons she had always her mind in thee and was devoted unto thee. Although tempted in many a way and remonstrated with she did not think of that Rākshasa in her inner mind. Her heart is pure and she is not spoiled with sin—do thou therefore take back Maithili. Do thou not speak other-wise—I do command thee\". Thereupon hearing those words—the virtuous-souled Rāma, the foremost of those skilled in speech, with his eyes agitated with delight, meditated for sometime. Being thus addressed, the highly effulgent and intelligent Rāma, of unmitigated prowess—the foremost of the pious, spoke unto that best of celestials saying—\"Beautiful (Sitā) lived in the inner appartment of Rāvana for a long time so she needs this purification in the presence of all people. If I would take the daughter of Janaka without purifying her, people would say that Rāma the son of king Daçaratha is lustful and ignorant of the morality of the people. I know it full well that Maithili, the daughter of king Janaka, hath her mind devoted unto me and hath not given it to anyone (else). As the ocean cannot go beyond its banks so Rāvana could not approach her having expansive eyes protected by virtue of her own chastity. The greatly vicious-souled one could not even by his mind get Maithili, who was beyond his reach like unto the burning flame of fire. Her mind could not have been moved although she lived in the inner appartment of Rāvana—she belongs to none else; Sitā is mine as the rays belong to the Sun. Maithili—the daughter of Janaka hath been purified before the three worlds—So I am incapable of renouncing her as a self-controlled person cannot forsake his (own) reputation. It behoveth me to carry out the well-meaning words of you all—the lords of people who have spoken them out of affection\". Saying this, the victorious, highly powerful, well renowned Rāghava, worthy of enjoying happiness, and having his praise chanted in consequence of his noble action, regaining his spouse, attained to happiness."

It is by good fortune, O Rāma, the dreadful and increasing darkness—the fear of all people—Rāvana, hath been removed by thee in the encounter. Consoling the poor Bharata and the famed Kauçalyā, beholding Kaikeyi and Sumitrā the mother of Lakshmana, obtaining the kingdom of Ayodhyā, pleasing all thy friends, establishing the prestige of thy family, thou of great strength, performing horse-sacrifices, attaining fair fame and conferring riches upon the Brahmins do thou repair to heaven. This king Daçaratha stationed on the car is thy father. He was thy superior on this earth, O Kākutstha. Obtaining thee as his son, that graceful (king) hath repaired to the region of Indra. Do thou bow unto him with thy brother Lakshmana\". Hearing the words of Mahādeva, Rāghava, along with Lakshmana, bowed unto their father who was seated on the top of the car. He with Lakshmana beheld their father shining in his own effulgence and wearing an unsullied cloth. Thereupon beholding his son dearer than his life, attaining great delight (in consequence thereof) placing him on his lap and embracing him with his arms, the great king Daçaratha, having long arms and seated on an excellent seat in the car, said—\"I am now in heaven and am equal with the celestials, but without thee, O Rāma, I do not like it—this is true—I do swear by thee. O thou the foremost of those skilled in speech, I have still in my mind the words which were uttered by Kaikeyi for sending thee away to the woods. Beholding thee all well and embracing thee with Lakshmana I am now shorn of grief like unto the sun, devoid of dues. I have been emancipated, O my son, through thee—a good and high-souled son, as the virtuous-souled Brahmana Kapāla was by Asthabakra. O gentle one, I have heard from the celestials, (that thou art) the excellent Purusha in the guise (of a man) for the destruction of Rāvana. Blessed is Kauçalyā, O Rāma, who shall be greatly delighted, on beholding thee, the slayer of enemies, gone home from the forest. Blessed are those men, O Rāma, who shall behold thee installed in the city as the king of the world. I wish to behold thee reconciled with Bharata, devoted powerful, pure and performing pious observances. O gentle one, thou hast spent fourteen years in the forest with Sitā and Lakshmana. The term of thy exile is over—thy promise hath been fulfilled; and slaying Rāvana, in the conflict thou hast pleased the celestials. Thou hast performed a mighty deed and attained to excellent fame, O slayer of enemies; and placed in charge of thy kingdom do thou with thy brothers attain a long life\". The king speaking thus Rāma spoke unto him with folded hands saying,—\"O thou conversant with piety, do thou be propitiated with Bharata and Kaikeyi. Thou didst imprecate Kaikeyi, saying,—\"I renounce thee with thy son\"—may not that dreadful curse visit her and her son\". Saying \"so be it\" unto Rāma with folded hands and embracing Lakshmana the great king said to him:—\"O thou conversant with piety and fame on this earth, thou shall attain to heaven and excellent state there. O thou the enhancer of Sumitrā's joy—do thou attend upon Rāma; may good betide thee; Rāma is ever engaged in the welfare of all beings. All these celestials headed by Indra, Siddhas and Great saints, bowing unto this high-souled and excellent Purusha, worship him. Rāma, the subduer of foes, is the indescribable and undecaying letter Brahma, which has, been described (in the Vedas) as the heart and secret of the celestials. For serving him along with Sitā, the daughter of king of Videha, thou hast attained piety and excellent fame\". Addressing Lakshmana thus, the king spoke unto his daughter-in-law, who was standing before him with folded hands, saying:—\"It doth not behove thee, O Vaidehi, to be enraged (with Rāma) for renouncing thee; for purifying thee this was done by him ever wishing thy welfare. What thou hast performed, O daughter, to establish the purity of thy character, is hard to perform. What thou hast done, shall glorify all other females. Though there is no necessity for giving thee any instruction as regards thy duty towards thy husband-still I should say that he is thy great god\". Having thus instructed his two sons and Sitā, he repaired, in his car, to the region of Indra. Having advised his two sons along with Sitā, ascending the car, and shining in his effulgence, that excellent king, greatly delighted, repaired to the region of the king of celestials."

Let all these highly powerful monkeys, who have been despatched to the abode of Death, on my account, regaining their life, stand up.

O Purandara, do thou revive all these heroic and powerful (monkeys) who did not care for death, and who worked hard and were distressed (for me). May all those, by thy favour, who were ever devoted unto me and did not care for death (even) regain their life—this is the boon I pray for. O conferror of honour, I wish to see all these monkeys, Golangulas and bears, pale and hurt, unheart and gifted with strength and prowess like before. Let there be flowers, fruits and roots, even out of season wherever these monkeys shall live—and let rivers there be full of clear water\". Hearing those words of the high-souled Rāghava Mahendra replied with words instinct with delight—\"O my boy, O foremost of the Raghus, mighty is the boon thou hast prayed for—my words shall never be falsified, so let them be be fulfilled. Let all those bears and Golangulas rise up who were slain in the conflict by Rākshasas and had their heads and arms severed. Let the monkeys gifted with their pristine strength and prowess rise up unhurt and healthy as if after the end of sleep. And being reconciled with their friends, relatives and kinsmen let them attain to excellent joy. O thou the wielder of a huge bow, all the trees shall be filled with flowers and fruits and all the rivers shall be filled with water even out of season (wherever they shall live)\". Thereupon all these leading monkeys who had their persons wounded but now healed up, rose up like those asleep. And all those monkeys were greatly wondered, saying, \"What is it?\" And beholding Kākutstha of accomplished, end and eulogizing Rāma and Lakshmana, all the celestials, greatly delighted, said,—\"Do thou, O king, repair to Ayodhyā—despatch all the monkeys—console the famed Maithilee, ever devoted unto thee—behold thy brother Bharata observing ascetic vows in consequence of thy grief—and the high-souled Satrughna and all thy mothers, O slayer of foes. And being Installed on the throne do thou conduce to the joy of all citizens\". Having thus addressed Rāma along with Lakshmana, the thousand-eyed Deity, delighted, went away along with the celestials, in their cars resembling the Sun (in brilliance). And saluting all the celestials, Kākutstha, with his brother Lakshmana, ordered the encampment of the army. Thereupon that famous and well-pleased huge army of the monkeys protected by Rāma and Lakshmana, appeared resplendant on all sides like unto a night beautified with the rays of the Moon."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Rāma having spent that night happily and risen up the next morning, Bibhishana, chanting his victory, spoke unto that slayer of foes, with folded hands, saying:—\"Here are various articles for bathing, pastes, clothes, ornaments, sandal and various excellent garlands. And here are present women having eyes like lotuses and conversant with the art of decking. Let them perform their duty, O Rāghava\". Being thus accosted Kākutstha replied unto Bibhishana, saying:—\"Do thou invite all these monkeys beaded by Sugriva to bathe. The virtuous-souled Bharata, having huge arms and ever used to comforts, is greatly distressed on my account. Without Bharata the son of Kaikeyi, ever performing pious rites, I do not value bathing or these clothes and ornaments. Do thou so manage that we may go to the city of Ayodhyā speedily. For difficult is the way leading to Ayodhyā\". Being thus accosted Bibhiskana relied unto Kākutstha,—\"O son of the lord of earth, may good betide thee, I shall soon take thee to that city. The car Puskpaka resembling the Sun, belonging to my brother Kuvera, was brought by the powerful Rāvana. O thou of unequalled prowess, that celestial and excellent car, going everywhere at will, since the destruction of Rāvana in battle, is ready for thee. And that car resembling the cloud is in the city of Lankā, in which thou shalt, relieved of thy anxiety, repair to Ayodhyā. If I am worthy of being favoured by thee, if dost thou remember any accomplishment of mine—if thou hast any friendship for me, do thou, O wise one, wait here with thy brother Lakshmana and spouse Vaidehi till I accomplish all my desires by worshipping thee. And then thou shalt go (to Ayodhyā) O Rāma. I shall worship thee with great delight and do thou, O Rāma, with thy friends and army, accept that adoration. O Rāma, out of love, honor, and brotherly feeling, I do crave thy permission. I am a servant I cannot command thee\". Being thus addressed, Rāma replied unto Bibhishaua in the presence of all the Rākshasas and monkeys, saying:—\"I have been worshipped by thee, O hero, with thy excellent counsels, with thy earnest endeavours and with thy great friendship. Do not think, O lord of Rākshasas, that I do not comply with thy request—my heart hastens me to behold my brother Bharata, who, to take me back, did come to the mount Chitrakuta, who laid low his crown at my feet and whose words I did not keep. (I am anxious to see) Kauçalyā, Sumitrā, Kaikeyi, with my friends, citizens and villagers. Do thou regard me, O Bibhishana, O gentle one, as worshipped. O friend do thou be not angry—I request thee. Do thou speedily being the car for me, O lord of Rākshasas—my work is done—how can I wish to live here long\". Being thus addressed by Rāma, Bibhishana the lord of Rākshasas, speedily brought the car resembling the Sun."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Thereupon arrived there the car adorned all over with gold paintings, altars crested with Baidurja jewels, having upper rooms, silvered all over, adorned with white flags and flagstaffs, beautified with gilt lotuses, adorned with golden houses, covered with a network of girdles, having windows made of pearls and jems, girt on all sides with a net of bells, giving forth melodious sound, resembling the summit of the mount Meru, constructed by Viçwakarmā (the architect of the celestials) adorned with huge apartments beautified with silver and pearls—having its base crested with crystal, containing excellent seats made of Baidurja, abounding in valuable coverlets and immense wealth, incapable of being broken down and coursing at will. And communicating unto Rāma (the arrival of that car) Bibhishana waited there. Beholding that flowery car, coursing at will and resembling a huge mountain, Rāma, of a generous spirit, along with Saumitri, attained to an excess of astonishment."

Do thou, satisfy them, O Bibhishana, with diverse jewels and riches. With these and thee, I conquered the city of Lankā, lord of Rākshasas. They all fought with a delighted heart, having renounced all fear of life and who did never go away from the battle-field. Do thou, with a gift of riches and jewel, make good the work of these monkeys and bears who encompassed the accomplishment (of my end). Being honoured and delighted by thee grateful, all these leading monkeys shall repair (to their respective quarters). (If thou art found to be) sacrificing, self-controlled, compassionate and (the just) collector of revenues, all shall be attached unto thee. For this I do address you (thus). O lord of men, the soldiers, disgusted, renounce that king who is void of all royal accomplishments, and who uselessly slays soldiers in the conflict\". Being thus accosted by Rāma, Bibhishana, with a distribution of jewels and riches, honoured all those monkeys. And beholding all those leading monkeys worshipped with jewels and riches Rāma ascended that excellent car, taking the bashful, and high-minded Vaidehi on his lap and accompanied, by his powerful brother Lakshmana, a skilled bowman. And being stationed on the car Kākutstha honouring all the monkeys, the highly powerful Sugriva and Bibhishana, said—\"O foremost of monkeys, ye have performed a friendly service—it hath been appreciated by me—do ye repair to your wished-for quarters. O Sugriva, thou, ever afraid of impiety, hast performed all that a loving and well-wishing friend should do. Do thou, encircled by thy army, proceed towards Kishkindhā. Do thou, O Bibhishana, live in thy kingdom, Lankā, conferred upon thee, by me. Not even the celestials, headed by Indra shall be able to assail thee. I wish to return to Ayodhyā, the capital of my father's (kingdom). I wish to obtain your permission (and for this) I have invited you all\". Being thus addressed by Rāma, all the leading monkeys bears as well as the Rākshasa Bibhishana said with folded hands—\"We wish all to go to Ayodhyā. Do thou take us. We shall all range with delight at forests and gardens. Beholding thee installed and bowing unto Kauçalyā, we shall soon return to our respective homes, O foremost of kings\". Being thus accosted by the monkeys with Bibhishana, the virtuous-souled Rāma, spoke unto them and Sugriva and Bibhishana, saying—\"Dearer than the dear, I shall attain to, when returning my city, along with you all, I shall enjoy in the company of all my friends and relatives. O Sugriva, do thou soon ascend the car along with the monkeys. Do thou ascend too, O Bibhishana, lord of Rākshasas, with all thy courtiers\". Thereupon ascended that celestial car Pushpaka, Sugriva, greatly delighted with the monkeys and Bibhishana, with his courtiers. And they all having got up, the excellent car, of Kuvera at the command of Rāghava, rose up in the welkin. And in that car coursing at will and drawn by effulgent ganders, Rāma greatly delighted appeared like Kuvera (himself). And all the monkeys, bears and the highly powerful Rākshasas sat in that celestial car unobstructed and at their pleasure."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Being commanded by Rāma, that excellent car, drawn by ganders, with a huge noise, rose high up in the welkin. And casting his looks on all sides, Rāma, the descendant of Raghus, spake unto Sitā, the daughter of the king of Mithilā, having a moon-like countenance, saying,—\"O Vaidehi, do thou behold Lankā, situate on the summit of the mount Chitrakuta, resembling that of Kailāça and constructed by Viçwakarmā. And behold, O Sitā, that huge arena of battle, bathed in the blood and flesh of the monkeys and Rākshasas. Do thou behold, O thou having expansive eyes, Rāvana, the lord of Rākshasas, the repressor of people and who obtained a boon, lying there, slain by me on thy account. Kumbhakarna was slain there, the night-ranger Prahasta, as well, and Dumrāksha, were slain by the monkey Hanumān. Bidyutmāli was slain there by the high-souled Sushena—and Indrajit, the son of Rāvana, was slain there in the encounter, by Lakshmana. The Rākshasa named Bikata was slain there by Angadi—and Birupāksha, hard to look at and Mahaparsha and Mahodara. And the powerful Akampana was slain (there) and all other Rākshasas—Trishirā, Alikāya, Devāntaka and Narantaka—and the two leading and powerful Rākshasas, mad after conflict—the sons of Kumbhakarna—Nikumbha and Kumbha, Bajradanstra, Danstra and many other Rākshasas were slain and the irrepressible Makarāksha was slain (there) by me in the conflict. Akampana was slain—and the powerful Sonitāksha. And Yupāksha and Prajangha were destroyed (there) in the great conflict. The grim-visaged Rākshasa Viddutsjmha was slain there—and Yajnāsatru and the highly powerful Suptaghna. (And there was slain) Suryāsatru and Brahmasatru. (And there bewailed for Rāvana) his spouse Mandodari, surrounded by his thousand other wives. O thou having an excellent countenance, do thou behold the descending place of the ocean, where I spent the night after crossing the deep for thee. O thou having expansive eyes, for thee, this difficult construction of the bridge was made by me over the deep by the help of Nala. Do thou, O Vaidehi, behold the unagitated deep—the abode of Varuna, appearing as if without the other end, roaring and abounding in conchs and pearl oysters. O Maithili, do thou behold the golden mount, which rose above the deep for affording a resting place unto Hanumān. And on the bank of this ocean I halted with my soldiers. And here Mahādeva, the lord of the celestials, was propitiated with me. It behoveth thee to behold this descending place of the high-souled Ocean, known as Setubandha,488 worshipped of the three worlds, highly sacred and destroying even the worst sin. There, Bibhishana, the king of Rākshasas first came to me. Do thou behold, O Sitā, Kishkindhā, having beautiful gardens, the pleasant city of Sugriva, where Vāli was slain by me\". And beholding the city of Kishkindhā, ruled over by Vāli, Sitā, incited by her love, addressed Rāma, with worthy words, saying—\"O king, I wish to repair to Ayodhyā thy capital with thee, in the company of Tārā, the dear wife of Sugriva, as well as of the wives of other leading monkeys\". Being thus addressed by Vaidehi Rāghava replied—saying, \"this shall be done\" and getting at Kishkindhā he stopped the car. And having beheld the car stationed he spoke unto Sugriva, saying—\"O foremost of monkeys, do thou speak unto all the leading monkeys that they may go to Ayodhyā accompanied by their wives. O thou of great strength—they may all go with Sitā. Do thou hurry them on, O Sugriva. We shall (soon) go, O thou the lord of monkeys\". Being thus addressed by Rāma, of unmitigated prowess—the beautiful lord of monkeys, encircled by them, entered speedily the inner apartment and beholding Tārā there, said—\"O dear, at the command of Rāghava and the kind desire of Sitā, do thou soon go, taking with thee the wives of all the high-souled monkeys. We shall see Ayodhyā and the wives of Daçaratha\". Hearing the words of Sugriva, Tārā, having a perfectly beautiful person, assembling all the wives of the monkeys, said—\"You have been ordered by Sugriva to repair (to Ayodhyā) with the monkeys;—to behold Ayodhyā, is also a dear object of mine. (I shall behold) Rāma enter the city with the citizens and villagers and the wealth and riches of the wives of Daçaratha\". Being thus commanded by Tārā, the wives of the monkeys, putting on all their ornaments and circumambulating (her) ascended the car, with a view to behold Sitā. And beholding the car going up with them all, Rāghava again spoke unto Sitā, near the mount Rishyamuka, saying,—\"Do thou behold there, O Sitā, the huge and foremost mount Rishyamuka abounding in gold and various metals, like unto clouds accompanied with lightnings. There I was joined by Sugriva, the lord of monkeys. And there I entered into an agreement, O Sitā, for the destruction of Vāli. And there is (the lake) Pampā abounding in lilies and skirted by picturesque forest where separated from thee, I bewailed piteously. And on its bank I beheld the pious Savari. And there I slew Kavandha and Yoyanavāhu. Behold there, O Sitā, a beautiful tree, in Janasthāna, where, O thou ever used to luxuries, for thee, the highly powerful and energetic Yatāyu, the foremost of birds, was slain by Rāvana. Do thou behold there, O thou of a beautiful person, O thou of auspicious looks, our hermitage and the beautiful cottage of leaves, wherefrom thou hadst been carried away by force by the lord of Rākshasas. Do thou behold there the beautiful and sacred river Godāveri having clear water and the hermitage of Agastya, surrounded by plantain trees. Do thou behold there, O Vaidehi, the great hermitage of Sarabhanga, where came the thousand-eyed, Sakra, the subduer of enemies' cities. O worshipful dame, O thou having a middle stature—amongst all those ascetics, thou beholdest, there lived Atri, the lord of our family—resembling the fire of the Sun. There was slain the huge-bodied Birādha by me. There thou didst behold, O Sitā, the female ascetic (the wife of Attri) ever performing pious observances. There cometh in view, O thou having a beautiful person, the king of mountains, Chitrakuta, where to propitiate me, came the son of Sumitrā. Behold the beautiful Yamunā, having picturesque forest on its bank and the pleasant hermitage of Varadwāya. Behold there the sacred river Ganges, dividing itself into three branches. Behold there the city of Sringabera, where I made friendship with Guha. Behold there, O Sitā, the capital of my father. Do thou bow unto Ayodhyā, O Vaidehi\". Thereupon all the monkeys and Rākshasas along with Bibhishana rose up delightedly and saw the city. Thereupon the monkeys and Rākshasas beheld the city abounding in white houses having spacious compartments, filled with elephants and horses and looking like Amarāvati, the capital of Mahendra."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Having completed the fourteen years (of exile), the self-controlled elder brother of Lakshmana, arriving at the hermitage of Varadwāya on the fifth day, saluted the ascetic. And bowing unto Varadwāya, having asceticism for his wealth, he said,—\"O thou gifted with six sorts of wealth, hast thou heard of the prosperity and well being (of my city)? Is Bharata still engaged (in guarding the people)? Are my mothers living?\" Being thus addressed by Rāma the great ascetic Varadwāya replied, delighted, and smiling, unto that foremost of Raghus,—\"Abiding by thy command and with matted locks, Bharata is waiting for thee, always honoring thy sandals. And all others are well in thy house. O subduer of thy enemies, I was greatly pained, when I saw thee before entering the huge forest, wearing bark, three with thy wife,489 deprived of thy kingdom for piety only, walking on foot, renouncing every thing, obeying the command of thy sire, deprived of all comforts, like a celestial banished from heaven, deprived of thy kingdom at the words of Kaikeyi, and living on wild roots and fruits; but beholding thee now of accomplished end, with all thy friends having vanquished the enemy, I have attained to highest delight. O Rāghava, I am apprised of immense griefs and happinesses which befell thee when thou didst live in Janasthāna. Thy blameless spouse was carried away stealthily by Rāvana engaged as thou wert in the behoof of the Brāhmanas, and in the protection of all the ascetics. The view of Māricha—the carrying away of Sitā,—the beholding of the headless demon,—thy going to (the lake) Pampā,—thy friendship with Sugriva, where Vāli was slain by thee,—the enquiry of Vaidehi undertaken by the son of Wind-god,—the construction of the bridge by Nala after the whereabouts of Vaidehi had been known—the conflagration of Lankā by the delighted and the leading monkeys—the destruction, in the conflict, of Rāvana proud of his own strength, along with his sons, friends, courtiers, army and steeds—the arrival of the celestials on the destruction of Rāvana, the thorn of gods and the grant of boon by them—I have known all these by virtue of my asceticism, O thou fond of virtue. My disciples used to go hence to that city to bring tidings. I shall even now grant thee a boon, O foremost of those using weapons. Do thou accept my Arghya490 and then repair to Ayodhyā to-morrow\". And respectfully abiding by his words, that effulgent son of the king, delighted, begged of him the boon. \"O thou gifted with six qualities, on my way while proceeding to Ayodhyā, let all the trees, bearing fruits out of season, and producing honey, bear many a nectar-smelling fruit\". No sooner he replied saying,—\"Thy promise shall be fulfilled\" than all the trees there became like those of heaven. Trees without fruits were filled therewithal and trees without flowers were covered with them. All the trees, whose leaves were dried up, were enveloped with foliage and all of them began to pour honey. The way to Ayodhyā for three yojanas was thus filled all over (with trees). Thereupon thousands of monkeys, living, at pleasure and delightedly, on various celestial fruits, thought as if they were in heaven."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Thereupon beholding Ayodhyā, Rāma, the descendant of Raghu, of light movements and desirous of affording delight unto others, thought of welcoming (them). Thinking thus the intelligent and effulgent (Rāma) cast his looks towards the monkeys and spoke unto Hanumān, saying,—\"O foremost of monkeys, speedily reparing to Ayodhyā do thou learn of the welfare of all people in the palace of the king. Arriving at the city of Sringavera, do thou communicate unto Guha, the king of Nishadhas491 having the forest as his kingdon, my well-being, at my command. Hearing that I am hale and hearty and relieved of all troubles, Guha, my friend like my own self, shall attain to delight. And Guha, the lord of Nishadhas, delighted, shall inform thee of the way to Ayodhyā and the well being of Bharata. Do thou ask of Bharata his well-being at my words, and communicate unto him my (arrival) with Lakshmana and my spouse after having made good the vow (of my sire)—the carrying away of Sitā by the powerful Rāvana—the friendship with Sugriva and the destruction of Vāli in the conflict—the search of Maithili instituted by thee having got over the huge lord of rivers—the advance (of the monkeys) to the banks of the deep—the view of the ocean, the construction of the bridge—the destruction of Rāvana,—the grant of boon by Mahendra, Brahmā and Varuna—my meeting with my father by the favour of Mahādeva. Do thou, O gentle one, communicate unto Bharata, my arrival here with the lord of Rākshasas and king of monkeys. (Tell him) 'vanquishing his foes and attaining to excellent fame Rāma hath arrived at the gate of the city with his valiant friends, having satisfied the vow (of his sire).' Thou shouldst read the signs expressive of joy or sorrow that Bharata shall display on hearing this and infer therefrom his attitude towards me. Thou shouldst know, from the colour of his countenance, his looks and his words, all the movements and actions of Bharata. Whose mind doth not change obtaining such an ancestral kingdom, filled with all prosperity and abounding in elephants, horses and chariots? If the effulgent Bharata, the descendant of Raghu, ruling over it, wisheth the kingdom for himself, let him lord over the entire earth. Therefore, O monkey, it behoveth thee to come back speedily apprised of his intention and movements, before we proceed further\". Being thus commanded, Hanumān, the son of Wind-god, assuming a human shape speedily proceeded towards Ayodhyā. Hanumān the son of Māruta rose up in the welkin with velocity like unto Gāruda ready to fall upon a huge serpent. Then crossing the Wind-path and the abode of the birds, getting over the terrible confluence of the Ganges and Yamunā, reaching the city of Sringavera and meeting Guha, the energetic Hanumān, delighted, (addressed him) with the following excellent words—\"Thy friend Rāma, the descendant of Kākutstha, having truth for his prowess, with Sitā and son of Sumitrā, hath enquired of thy welfare. Having spent five nights492 till to-day, he, having obtained permission from the ascetic Varadwāja, shall proceed to-morrow\". Having said this the highly energetic monkey, not caring for the exhaustion of travel, greatly delighted and with hairs erect, rose up with great velocity. Beholding the holy river sanctified with the name of Parasurāma, the rivers—Bālukini, Baruthi, Gomati, the huge forest of Sāla trees, the various countries populated with thousands of people, and proceeding a great distance speedily, that foremost of monkeys got at the trees near Nandigrām493 like unto those of Chaitraratha, the garden of the lord of celestials the flowers whereof were being plucked off by many a damsel accompanied by their children decked in various ornaments. He saw at a distance of one crosa from Ayodhyā, Bharata wearing the skin of an antelope, poorly, greatly reduced, living in a hermitage, wearing matted hairs, having his body covered with dirt, greatly pulled down in consequence of his brother's disaster, living on roots and fruits, self-controlled; living the life of an ascetic, observing pious observances, with a bundle of clotted hairs on his head, wearing bark and deer skin, having control over his passions and senses, effulgent like Brahmarshis, ruling the earth always placing the sandals before him, protecting people of four Varnas against all fear, with courtiers, priests leading a holy life and soldiers all wearing red clothes; around him. All those citizens, fond of piety, did not like to use good clothes beholding the prince use bark and deer skin. Thereupon Hanumān, the son of Maruta spake with folded hands unto him, conversant with piety like virtue incarnate, saying—\"Kākutstha, living in the forest of Dandaka with bark and matted hairs, for whom thou art lamenting, hath enquired after thy welfare. Do thou, O worshipful sire, speak out thy welfare and renounce the dreadful grief. Thou shalt in this moment be reconciled to thy brother Rāma. Slaying Rāvana, and regaining Maithili, Rāma, having accomplished his end, hath arrived here with his valiant friends. The highly effulgent Lakshmana and the famed Vaidehi (have also come). Sitā fareth well with Rāma like unto Sachi in the company of Mahendra\". Being thus addressed by Hanumān, Bharata, the son of Kaikeyi, delighted, fell down all on a sudden in a swoon of joy. Thereupon rising up in no time, and welcoming him, Bharata, the descendant of Raghu, spake unto Hanumān communicating the pleasant tidings, the following words. And embracing the monkey respectfully the graceful Bharata sprinkled him with profuse tears not out of grief but of joy. He said,—\"Art thou a man or god who hast kindly come here? O gentle one, I shall confer upon thee, who hast communicated unto me this pleasant tidings, hundreds and thousands of kine, hundreds of prosperous villages, sixteen young wives, pious, wearing excellent Kundalas, golden-hued, having beautiful noses and breasts, having moon-like countenances, decked with all ornaments and born of respectable families\". And hearing from that leading monkey of that wonderful return of Rāma, the son of the king, delighted became anxious to behold him and again addressed joyously Hanumān with the following words."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "\"I hear the tidings of my brother affording me great delight who hath been living in the huge forest for many a year. The saying of the people appeareth to me as instinct with well meaning that a man, if alive, may attain to joy even after a century. Do thou relate truly unto me, how and in what country the union between Rāghava and the monkeys was brought about\". Being thus accosted by the prince and seated on Kuça, he, thereupon, began to describe Rāma's life in the forest. \"How Rāma was exiled, the two boons conferred upon thy mother, how king Daçaratha died in consequence of (his) son's grief, how by emissaries, O lord, thou wert brought up from the house of thy maternal uncle, how thou didst not wish for the kingdom having entered Ayodhyā, how thy brother, the repressor of enemies, was solicited by thee for accepting the kingdom, reparing to the mount Chitrakuta, who hast ever wended the track of the pious, the renouncement of kingdom (by him) abiding by the words of the king, thy return after taking the sandals of thy revered (brother)—all these, O thou of long-arms, are known to thee. I shall relate unto thee all that happened after thy return. Thyself having returned thence, all the birds and animals were overwhelmed with terror and that forest appeared as if distressed. Thereupon he entered the solitary and huge and dreadful forest Dandaka distressed by the elephants and abounding in lions, tigers and deer. And they entering the dense forest there appeared before them the powerful Birādha494 emitting a dreadful sound. And taking him up roaring aloud like an elephant Rāma threw him with his arms upwards and face downwards into a pit. Having accomplished that difficult work the two brothers Rāma and Lakshmana, arrived in the evening at the pleasant hermitage of Sarabhanga. And Sarabhanga having attained to heaven, Rāma, having truth for his prowess, saluting all the ascetics, repaired to Janasthāna. And by the high-souled Rāghava, living there, fourteen thousand inhabitants of Janasthāna were slain. In the company of one person only and at the commencement of the fight, by Rāma, within the one fourth part of a day, were exterminated all the highly powerful and valiant inhabitants of the forest of Dandaka always putting obstructions in the way of the ascetics. All the Rākshasas were grinded (to death) by Rāghava. Khara was slain in the conflict; Dushana being slain first Trishirā was slain thereafter by him. Thereafter (a she-demon) named Surpanakhā, came to the side of Rāma. Thereupon being commanded by Rāma, the highly powerful Lakshmana rose up all on a sudden and taking a dagger chopped off her ears and nose. Being thus insulted by him that she-demon came to Rāvana. Thereupon a dreadful Rākshasa named Māricha—an attendant of Rāvana, assuming the shape of a jewelled deer, allured Vaidehi. And beholding it, Vaidehi spake unto Rāma, saying,—'Do thou catch it; with it when caught our hermitage shall be more charming.' Thereupon Rāma, with bow in his hand, pursued that deer and with one shaft destroyed it. O gentle one, Rāghava going out on hunting, and Lakshmana having issued out of the hermitage, the Ten-necked (demon) entered therein. And he speedily got hold of Sitā, like unto Rohini possessed by the planet in the sky. Thereupon slaying the vulture Yatāyu in the conflict desirous of rescuing her and getting hold of Sitā that Rākshasa speedily repaired (to his capital). Thereupon some monkeys resembling mountains, stationed on the summit of a mountain, stricken with wondrous fear and astonishment, beheld Rāvana, the lord of Rākshasas proceed with Sitā. Ascending the car Puskpaka, going at will, with Vaidehi and hastening his course that highly powerful Rāvana, the lord of Rākshasas entered Lankā. And entering the huge and excellent golden palace Rāvana consoled Maithili with (diverse) words. But she regarded that foremost of Rākshasas and his words as straw. And Vaidehi was placed in the forest of Asoka. Thereupon returned Rāma after having slain the deer in the forest. Having returned and seen the vulture, dearer than his father, slain, Rāma, the descendant of Kākutstha was pained. And searching Vaidehi and ranging at the banks of Godāveri and forest-lands covered with flowers, Rāma with Lakshmana, met in that huge forest a Rākshasa named Kavandha. Thereupon at the words of Kavandha, Rāma, having truth for his prowess, repairing to the mount Rishyamuka, was united with Sugriva. There had grown mutual love in them before they were known to each other. Sugriva was driven away by his angry brother Vāli. And informed of each other's affairs their friendship grew closer. There-upon slaying the huge-bodied and highly powerful Vāli in the conflict by virtue of the strength of his own arms Rāma obtained (for Sugriva) his own kingdom. And being placed on the throne with all the monkeys, Sugriva promised unto Rāma the enquiry of the Princess (Sitā). Being commanded by the high-souled Sugriva, the lord of monkeys, ten kotis of monkeys repaired to (various) quarters. Among them some of us lost our way in a cavity of the Vindhya mountain, and were striken with great terror—and accordingly much time was lost. The powerful brother of the king of vultures named Sampāti communicated unto us the residence of Sitā in the palace of Rāvana. Thereupon removing the grief of my relatives stricken with sorrow and resorting to my own prowess, I jumped over a hundred yojanas and beheld her placed in the forest of Asoka, wearing a red cloth, pale, deprived of all joy and observing strict penances. And then nearing her and beholding her of a perfectly blameless person I bestowed upon her an ensign a ring with Rāma's name engraven on it. And obtaining a jewel as an ensign, I, with my object accomplished, returned. And having returned I presented Rāma of unwearied actions with that ensign of a brilliant gem. And hearing (of the news of Vaidehi) Rāma regained his life like one on the verge of death regaining his being after drinking nectar. And exciting (his soldiers) for making preparations like unto Fire about to destroy all people he made up his mind for the devastation of Lankā. Thereupon arriving at the banks of the ocean he had a bridge constructed by Nala by which the army of monkey-heroes crossed (the deep). Nala destroyed Prahasta, Rāghava slew Kumbhakarna, Lakshmana killed the son of Rāvana and Rāma himself slew Rāvana. He was then met by Sakra, Yama, Varuna, Siva, Brahmā and Daçaratha. And that graceful descendant of Kākutstha, the slayer of foes, obtained the boon from them as well as from the saints assembled there—(celestial and otherwise). Having obtained the boon he, delighted, met the monkeys and in the car Pushpaka reached Kishkindhā. Again reaching the Ganges he is living with the ascetic; it becometh thee to behold him to-morrow under the auspices of of Pushya,495 without any hindrance\". Thereupon being delighted with the sweet accents of Hanumān, Bharata addressed him, with folded hands, with words affording delight, saying,—\"After a long time my desire hath been fulfilled\"."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Hearing those words affording great delight, Bharata, the slayer of enemies, having truth for his prowess, delighted, ordered Satrughna, (saying),—\"Let all people being purified worship all the deities and altars of the city with fragrant garlands and diverse music. Let all the bards conversant with the chanting of the pedigree, the flatterers, all those conversant with music, the dancing girls, the queens, the courtiers, the soldiers with their wives, Brāhmanas, Kshatryas, and people of all other castes, issue out to behold the moon-like countenance of Rāma\". Hearing the words of Bharata, Satrughna, the slayer of enemies, divided the work amongst the servants, (saying),—\"Do ye level the high and low ground from Nandigrām to (Ayodhyā). Do ye perfectly water the ground with cold water. Thereafter sprinkle all the places with flowers and dried paddy; hoist up flags all over the city; decorate all the houses, before the rising of the moon with garlands, jewels, flowers of gold and things of five other colours. Let hundreds of men watch the thorough-fares\". Hearing the command of Satrughna, issued out with delight Dhristi, Jayanta, Vijaya, Siddartha, Arthasadhaka, Asoka, Mantrapāla and Sumantra. Thereupon issued out men on horse back and in cars with thousands of mad elephants well-decked with pennons and she-elephants with golden seats (on their backs). And some heroes proceeded encircled by a thousand excellent steeds and persons carrying Sakti, Risthi, maces and pennons and thousands of infantry. Thereupon proceeded Sumitrā and all other wives of Daçaratha placing Kauçalya before them and seated in excellent conveyances. And hearing of the return of his brother and attaining to delight, the high-souled and pious Bharata, reduced with fasting, poorly, wearing bark and skin of an antelope and conversant with religion, issued out to receive back Rāma in the company of his counsellors and encircled by the twice-born ones, the people of diverse castes, his own relations and kinsmen and ministers with garlands and Modaka496 in their hands, eulogized by the bards, having his arrival announced with the sound of conchs and bugles and placing the sandals of his worshipful brother on his head and taking white umbrella adorned with white garlands and white Chowries decked with gold and worthy of being used by the kings. Thereupon with the sound of the horses' hoofs and cars, conchs and bugles the earth shook. And the whole city went to Nandigrām. And beholding the Wind-god's son, Bharata said,—\"Didst thou not resort to the usual fickleness of the monkeys? We do not behold the worshipful Rāma, the descendant of Kākutstha—the slayer of foes. Nor do we behold the monkeys assuming shapes at will\". Having been addressed with those words, Hanumān replied, communicating unto Bharata, having truth for his prowess, the truth,—\"Having reached the trees, covered by the favour of Varadwaja, with fruits and flowers and pouring honey, the monkeys are emitting noise like maddened black bees. O slayer of foes, this boon was granted him (Rāma) by Vāsava. (Varadwaya) is treating him with his army with all hospitality. Hear the dreadful noise of the delighted monkeys. Methinks the monkey host hath crossed the river Gomati. Behold the huge upheaval of dust towards the Sāla forest. Methinks the monkeys are agitating the graceful Sāla forest. Behold there at the distance the car resembling the Sun. This celestial car Pashpaka, constructed by Brahmā's mind, was obtained by the high-souled (Rāma) after having slain Rāvana with his friends. This celestial car, resembling the newly risen Sun, coursing at will and carrying Rāma (was gained) by the favour of the Giver of wealth. (There are) the two heroic brothers—the descendants of Raghu with Yaidehi, the highly effulgent Sugriva and the Rākshasa Bibhishana. Thereupon with the sound of \"there is Rāma\" there arose a joyous noise reaching the abode of the celestials from among women, children, the young and the old. Thereupon descending upon the earth from chariots, elephants and horses all people beheld him (Rāma) stationed on the car like unto the moon in the sky. And facing Rāghava and with folded hands Bharata delightedly worshipped him with agreeable words, Arghya and water to wash his feet. There appeared in the car constructed by Brahmā's mind the elder brother of Bharata having expansive eyes like the immortal wielder of thunder-bolt. Thereupon Bharata humbly saluted his brother Rāma seated on the top of the car like unto the Sun on the summit (of the mount Meru). And commanded by Rāma that excellent car drawn by ganders got down on the earth with great velocity. And ascending that car, Bharata, having truth for his prowess, reaching Rāma, delighted, again bowed unto him. And raising Bharata up who had been seen after a long time and placing him on his lap Kākutstha, delighted, embraced him. There-upon Bharata, the slayer of foes, bowed unto Vaidehi and welcomed Lakshmana. And the son of Kaikeyi (then in turn) embraced Sugriva, Jāmbavāna, Angada, Mainda, Dwivida, Nila and Rishava. And he then embraced Sushena, Nala, Gabāksha, Gandhamādana, Sarabha, and Panasa. And assuming human shapes, those monkeys, assuming shapes at will, delightedly enquired after Bharata's well-being. And embracing Sugriva, the foremost of monkeys, the highly effulgent prince Bharata, the foremost of the pious, said—\" O Sugriva, thou art our fifth brother. From brotherliness groweth friendship and doing injury is the sign of an enemy\". And Bharata then addressed Bibhishana with soothing words—\"It is by fortune that through your help he hath accomplished such a difficult work\". Thereupon the heroic Satrughna saluting Rāma and Lakshmana, respectfully bowed unto Sitā. And having approached his mother, pale and pulled down with grief, Rāma humbly touched her feet and enhanced her delight. And thereupon saluting Sumitrā, famed Kaikeyi and all his mothers he approached the priests. Thereupon all the citizens with folded hands welcomed him saying—\"Welcome art thou, O thou of long arms! O thou the enhancer of Kauçalya's joy!\" And the elder brother of Bharata observed the folded hands of the citizens like so many blown lotuses. And himself taking the sandals of Rāma, Bharata, conversant with piety, placed them at the feet of that lord of men. Thereupon Bharata with folded hands spoke unto Rāma, saying—\"This all thy kingdom, which thou didst leave to my care, I return thee. Blessed is my birth to-day and accomplished is my desire, since I behold thee again as king in Ayodhyā after thy return. Do thou examine thy wealth, treasury, palace and army. By thy favour I have increased all these ten fold\". Hearing Bharata speak in that wise and beholding him devoted to his brother all the monkeys and the Rākshasa Bibhishana shed tears. Thereupon placing Bharata, in delight, on his lap, Rāghava, with his army in that car, proceeded towards Bharata's abode. And reaching Bharata's palace Rāghava with his army descended upon the earth. Thereupon Rāma said to the excellent car—\"Do thou (now) go to Vaisrāvana—I do permit thee\". Thereupon being thus commanded by Rāma, that excellent car, proceeding towards the north, reached the abode of the Giver of wealth. That celestial car Pushpaka had been taken away by the Rākshasa (Rāvana); but now at the words of Rāma it reached (again) the Giver of wealth. And touching the feet of his priest the powerful Rāghava sat on a separate and excellent seat like unto Sakra, the lord of immortals (by the side of) Vrihashpati."

  "Yuddhakāndam": "Thereupon having placed her palms on his head Bharata, the enhancer of Kaikeyi's joy, spoke unto his elder brother Rāma, having truth for his prowess, saying,—\"Abiding by my mother's request thou didst confer this kingdom upon me; I do return thee the kingdom thou didst give me. Like unto a young one unable to carry a heavy burden thrown off by a powerful bull I am unable to carry this huge burden (of the kingdom). I do consider this kingdom infested with thieves, difficult to govern, as it is difficult to re-construct a bridge broken down by a powerful current of water. As an ass cannot follow the course of a horse and a crow cannot follow that of a gander, so I am unable, O hero, O slayer of foes, to follow thy footsteps. If a tree planted in the inner appartment of a house, growing huge with a big trunk and many branches, is dried up as soon it blossoms without bearing fruits, his object for whom it is planted, becomes fruitless. And this simili, O thou of long-arms, shall prove good in thee, if dost thou not, our master, govern us, O lord of men, who are thy servants. Let the world, O Rāghava, behold thee installed (to-day) like unto the powerful mid-day Sun burning in effulgence. Do thou sleep and rise up with the sound of stringed instruments, womens' girdles and Nupuras and charming songs. Do thou govern the people as long as the solar system exists and as far as the earth extends\". Hearing the words of Bharata, Rāma the conqueror of enemies' cities, saying,—\"So be it\" sat on an excellent seat. Thereupon at the command of Satrughna, expert, skilful and quick-handed barbers gathered round Rāghava. At first, Bharata, the highly powerful Lakshmana, Sugriva the lord of monkeys, and Bibhishana the lord of Rākshasas bathed. Thereupon shorn of his matted hairs, bathed, with paste excellent garlands and precious clothes on, he appeared there shining in grace. The valiant and graceful Satrughna, the upholder of the dignity of Ikshwaku race, himself got ready the dresses for Rāma and Lakshmana. And all the high-minded wives of Daçaratha with their own hands decked Sitā with various charming (ornaments). Thereupon Kauçalyā, delighted and fond of her son, herself with great care, decorated the wives of monkeys. Thereupon at the words of Satrughna, the charioteer by name Sumantra got ready the perfectly beautiful car. And beholding that celestial car, bright as the fire of the sun, stationed before him, Rāma, having long arms, the conqueror of enemies' cities, ascended it. Sugriva and Hanumān, graceful like Mahendra, bathed, dressed in celestial clothes and wearing excellent Kundalas, proceeded (to view the city). And then went Sitā and all the wives of Sugriva decorated with all ornaments and wearing excellent Kundalas, anxious to behold the city. All the ministers of king Daçaratha in Ayodhyā began to hold consultation respectfully with the priest. Asoka, Vijaya and Siddhartha, with undivided mind, consulted with each other about the welfare of Rāma as well as that of the city. (Thereupon they ordered the servants) saying,—\"Do ye collect materials necessary for the auspicious installation of the high-souled (Rāma) worthy of being crowned with victory\". The priest and the ministers having ordered thus all speedily issued out of the city to behold Rāma. Like unto the thousand-eyed Indra in his car drawn by horses the blameless Rāma, seated in his car, proceeded towards the excellent city. Bharata took up the reins, Satrughna held the umbrella and Lakshmana began to fan him on the head with Chowries. And Bibhishana, the lord of Rākshasas standing on one side, took up the white Chowrie shining like the second moon. There was audible the sweet encomium of Rāma chanted by the crowd of ascetics in the sky, the celestials and the Marutas. Thereupon the highly effulgent Sugriva, the foremost of monkeys, got up upon an elephant named Satrunyaya resembling a mountain. And riding nine thousand elephants proceeded the monkeys assuming human shapes and adorned with various ornaments. And with the music of conches and bugles that foremost of men entered the city abounding in houses. (And the citizens) beheld Rāghava enter the city with a graceful person and seated in the car. And they having bowed unto that descendant of Kākutstha were welcomed by him. And they followed that high-souled one encircled by his brothers. And surrounded by his courtiers, Brāhmanas and subjects Rāma appeared beautiful like unto the Moon encircled by stars. And he went proceeded by men who play on stringed instruments, by people with Karatal and Sustika in their hands and by men chanting delightedly auspicious songs. Persons with Akshata and gold in their hands, kine, girls, Brāhmanas and persons with Modaka in their hands went before Rāma. Thereupon before the ministers Rāma began to describe the friendship of Sugriva, the prowess of the Wind-god's son and the works accomplished by the monkeys. And hearing of the works of the monkeys and the prowess of the Rākshasas, the inhabitants of the city of Ayodhyā attained to astonishment. Having related thus (the works of the monkeys) the graceful Rāma encircled by the monkeys entered (the city of) Ayodhyā abounding in delighted and plump persons. Thereupon the citizens hoisted up flags upon every house and he reached the picturesque abode of his ancestors inhabited by the descendants of Ikshwaku. And having reached and entered his ancestral palace and bowed unto Kauçalyā, Sumitrā and Kaikeyi, the high-souled prince, the enhancer of the joy of the descendants of Raghu, addressed Bharata the foremost of the pious, with sweet words instinct with meaning, saying,—\"Do thou set apart for Sugriva my huge and excellent palace abounding in pearls and Vaidurjas\". Hearing those words, Bharata, having truth for his prowess, taking Sugriva by the hand, conducted him to the palace. And commanded by Satrughna, (servants) speedily entered (that palace) with oil, lamps, bedsteads and beddings. Thereupon the highly effulgent younger brother of Rāghava spoke unto Sugriva, saying,—\"Do thou, O lord, order some (to bring water) for Rāma's installation\". And Sugriva conferred upon four leading monkeys four golden jars crested with diverse jewels and said to them,—\"Do ye so conduct, O monkeys, that ye may return by the dawn with the jars filled with the water of the four oceans\". Being thus addressed by the high-souled (Sugriva) the monkeys resembling the elephants speedily rose up in the welkin like unto quick-coursing vultures. Jāmbavāna, Hanumān, the monkey Vegadarshi and Rishabha brought the jars filled with water from five hundred rivers. Sushena, gifted with prowess, brought that jar crested with gems, filled with water from the Eastern Ocean. And Rishabha speedily brought water from the Southern Ocean. And Gabaya brought, from the great Western Ocean in that golden jar, water perfumed with the fragrance of red sandal and camphor. And the virtuous-souled Wind-god's son, gifted with all accomplishments and the prowess of Gāruda and Wind-god, brought, speedily from the Northern Ocean, water in that jewelled jar. And beholding water thus brought by the leading monkeys for the installation of Rāma, Satrughna, with his ministers, communicated that unto the leading priests and friends. Thereupon the self-controlled Vasishtha, striken in years, along with other Brahmanas placed Rāma with Sitā on a jewelled seat. Vasishtha, Vijayā, Jāvāli, Kātyāyana, Goutama and Bāmadeva, sprinkled that foremost of men, with clear and fragrant water as Vasus did the thousand eyed Vāsava. (He was then sprinkled by) the Rittigas, Brāhmanas, maidens ministers, soldiers and the merchants all delighted. (There-upon) with the juice of Oshadhis497 (he was sprinkled by) the celestials stationed in the sky, the deities presiding over the four quarters and all other celestials collected. And having placed him on a seat crested with various jewels in the arena decorated with gold, various jewels and rich parapharnalia, (he placed on his head) the jewelled crown made by Brahmā, brilliant and with which in the days of yore Manu and other kings, born in his race, were installed. And being decked by the high-souled Vasishtha with that crown, Rāghava was afterwards dressed with the celestial garments by the Rittigas.498 And Satrughna held the white and excellent umbrella and Sugriva the lord of monkeys took the white Chowrie. And Bibhishana the lord of Rākshasas took up another Chowrie resembling the moon. And the wind commanded by Vāsava conferred upon Rāghava, a garland of a hundred golden lotuses, shining in their native lustre. And the wind commanded by Sakra conferred upon that lord of men a jewelled garland crested with diverse gems. The intelligent and worthy Rāma being installed the celestials and the Gandharvas sang and the Apsaras danced. The earth was filled with crops, the trees with fruits and the flowers were fragrant on the occassion of Rāghava's installation. And that foremost of men conferred upon the twice-born ones one million of horses, a hundred thousand cows and a hundred thousand bulls. And Rāghava again conferred upon the Brāhmanas thirty crores of golden coins and diverse costly ornaments and clothes. Thereupon that lord of men conferred upon Sugriva a celestial garland brilliant like the rays of the Sun and crested with gold and jewels. And he, gifted with intelligence, conferred upon Angada, Vāli's son, two Angadas499 brilliant as the rays of the moon and made of Baidurja. And Rāma conferred upon Sitā an excellent pearl necklace crested with precious jems, celestial clothes and various excellent ornaments. And taking off the necklace from her person Vaidehi, the daughter of king Janaka, conferred it upon the Wind-god's son remembering the services (rendered by him) and cast her looks again and again upon her lord and the monkeys. And beholding that (Rāma) capable of reading the gestures, spoke unto the daughter of king Janaka, saying—\"O fortunate and beautiful lady, do thou confer this necklace upon him with whom thou art pleased\". Thereupon the lotus-eyed (Sitā) conferred that upon the Wind god's son. And Hanumān, the foremost of monkeys, in whom perpetually exist, energy, forgiveness, fame, skillfullness, prowess, humility, tactics, manliness, valiance and intellect, appeared with that necklace like a mountain beautified with the rays of the moon and white clouds. And all other elderly and leading monkeys were respectively honoured with clothes and ornaments. And being honoured by Rāma of unwearied actions with enough of jewels and other wished-for objects, Bibhishana, Sugriva, Hanumān, Jāmbavān and other leading monkeys, delighted, returned to their respective habitations. Thereupon, the lord of earth and the slayer of foes conferred, all wished-for things, upon Dwivida, Mainda and Nila. And beholding (the installation of Rāma) the high-souled monkeys, taking leave of the lord of earth, went to Kishkindhā. And beholding the inauguration of Rāma, Sugriva, the foremost of monkeys, honored by Rāma, repaired to the city of Kishkindhā. And having obtained his own kingdom, the greatly famous and virtuous-souled Bibhishana, with all the Rākshasas, repaired to the city of Lankā. Having slain his foes, the highly generous and glorious Rāma, ruled in great delight, the kingdom extending all over the earth. And Rāma, fond of the pious, spoke unto Lakshmana, conversant with piety; saying—\"O thou conversant with piety, do thou with me and four-fold forces, govern this kingdom, ruled by our predecessors. Like unto our ancestors do thou now carry the burden of an associate in the throne\". When the son of Sumitrā did not accept the heir apparentship albeit solicited earnestly again and again, the high-souled (Rāma) conferred upon Bharata that dignity. And that son of king performed various sacrifices such as Paundarika,500 Aswamedha,501 Bājimedha and others. And governing the kingdon for ten thousand years Rāghava performed ten horse-sacrifices with excellent horses and profuse presents. And that highly powerful Rāma, having his arms extended up to the knee-joint, having a spacious breast and Lakshmana as his attendant, ruled the earth (in this wise). And obtaining that excellent kingdom, the virtuous-souled Rāghava performed many sacrifices with his sons, brothers and friends. And Rāma governing the kingdom, the widows were not distressed and there was no fear from voracious animals or from diseases. The people were saved from the thieves and there was no other trouble. And the old were not constrained to perform the funeral ceremonies of the children. All were delighted and devoted to pious observances. And beholding Rāma they did not envy one another. And Rāma governing the kingdom, (people) lived for a thousand years and had a thousand children,—they were freed from diseases and sorrow. And the trees bore fruits and flowers perpetually—there were showers at will and the wind blew pleasant. And the people delighted engaged in their respective works and the subjects grew pious and truthful, under Rāma's regime, and were devoted to the observance of all pious works and gifted with all auspicious marks. And Rāma ruled the kingdom for ten thousand years. And this sacred Epic, the first of its kind, affording piety, fame, and long life, and describing the conquest of the kings, was composed by Valmiki in the days of yore. He, who on this earth, shall hear (this story) shall be divested of sins. People, wishing for children, shall obtain the same and those, wishing for riches, shall get by them. Thus people on this earth shall attain to their wished-for objects hearing of this Rāma's installation—the king may conquer the earth and subdue his foes. Females may obtain sons (in the same way) as Kauçalyā gave birth to Rāma, Sumitrā to Lakshmana and Kaikeyi to Bharata. Hearing the story of this work describing the victory of Rāma of unwearied actions one may attain to a long life. He, who with devotion and having his anger subdued, shall hear the story of this epic written by Valmiki in the days of yore shall get over all troubles. And hearing the story of the Epic composed by Valmiki in the days of yore, one living in foreign countries, shall return home and enjoy in the company of his friends. Hearing this people shall secure all their wished-for objects from Rāghava and the celestials shall be greatly delighted. When this book is kept in a house it becomes free from the disturbance of evil spirits. Hearing this a king may conquer the earth, and one living in a foreign country fareth well. If a female, during her monthly course, hears the story, she shall give birth to an excellent son. By reading and worshipping this ancient history people are freed from all sins and attain to a long life. The Kshatryas, bending low their heads, should hear this daily from the Brāhmanas. Hearing or reading the whole of Ramāyana, forsooth shall people get sons and riches. Rāma is ever pleased with him. He is the ever-existing Vishnu—the first God, the huge-armed Hari, Narayana and Lord. This ancient work produceth such fruits. May good betide ye. Do ye openly declare that Vishnu's prowess may increase. The celestials shall be greatly delighted for reading or hearing this story of Rāma and the progenitors shall be always pleased. Those, who shall write this story of Rāma first recorded by the Rishi (Valmiki) shall reach the region of Brahmā. Hearing this people attain to, on this earth, multiplied relations, increased wealth and crops, beautiful wives, excellent happiness, and the accomplishment of all desires. They attain to long life, health, fame, intellect, prowess, and good brothers. Therefore it behoveth those good men, who wish for prosperity, to hear this story perpetually."

  "Uttara Kānda": "On the Rākshasas having been slain, all the ascetics, forthe purpose of congratulating Rāghava, came to Rāma ashe gained (back) his kingdom. Kauçika, and Yavakrita, andGārgya, and Gālava, and Kanva—son untoMādhālithi,—who dwelt in the east, (came thither); and the reverendSwastyāstreya, and Namuchi, and Pramuchi, and Agastya, andthe worshipful Atri, and Sumukha, and Vimukha,—who dweltin the south,—came in company with Agastya.1 AndNrishadgu, and Kahashi, and Dhaumya, and that mightysage—Kauçeya—who abode in the western quarter, camethere accompanied by their disciples. And Vasishtha andKaçyapa and Atri and Viçwamitra with Gautama andJamadagni and Bharadwaja and also the seven sages,2 whofor aye resided in the northern quarter, (came there). Andon arriving at the residence of Rāghava, those high-souledones, resembling the fire in radiance, stopped at the gate,with the intention of communicating their arrival (to Rāma)through the warder. And that foremost of ascetics—therighteous Agastya—versed in various branches of learningand cognizant of the Vedas along with theirbranches,—addressed the warder, saying,—\"Do thou say unto Daçaratha'sson that we—the sages—have come (here).\" Then at thewords of Agastya, the gate-keeper quick3 and swift presentedhimself with celerity before the high-souled Rāghava. Andthat one versed in polity and emotional expressions, ofworthy ways, possessed of ability and endowed with patience,swiftly seeing Rāma resembling the full moon in brightness,communicated unto him the arrival of that supreme ofsaints—Agastya. Hearing of the arrival of the anchorets,possessed of the effulgence of the sun new-risen, heanswered the warder, saying,—\"Do thou usher them in, havingregard to their comfort.\" And seeing the ascetics beforehim, Rāma with joined hands worshipped their feetwith arghyas, and with regard consecrated a cow untoeach, and saluting them with a collected mind, he ordered seats(for the saints). And having, according to their rank, seatedthemselves on gorgeous and superb seats of Kuça ordeer-skins embroidered with gold, those foremost of sages—thosemighty saints, versed in the Vedas,—along with their disciplesand leaders, having (previously) been asked as to their welfare,addressed Rāma, saying,—\"O son of Raghu. O mighty-armedone, complete welfare is ours. By good luck it is that we seethee fortunate, with all thy foes finished. By good luck it isthat, O king, Rāvana—destroyer of creatures—hath been slainby thee. Sure, O Rāma, it was no great matter for thee (to slay)Rāvana along with his sons and grandsons. Furnished withthy bow, thou canst, without doubt, destroy the three worldsthemselves. By good fortune it is, O Rāma, that Rāvanaalong with his sons and grandsons hath been slain by thee.By good fortune it is that to-day we see thee victoriousalong with Sitā, and, O righteous-souled one, with thybrother, Lakshmana, (ever) compassing thy profit. (By goodfortune it is) that, O king, to-day we behold (thee) incompany with thy mothers and thy brothers. By goodfortune it is that those night-rangers, Prahasta, and Vikata,and Virupāksha, and Mahodara, and the unconquerableAkampana, have all been slain (by thee). By good fortuneit is, O Rāma, that he than whose proportions there are noother's greater on earth,—even Kumbhakarna, was broughtdown (by thee). By good luck it is, O Rāma, that thosehighly powerful night-rangers. Triçiras and Atikāya andDevāntaka and Narāntaka, have been slain by thee. Bygood luck it is that thou hadst been encountered in ahand-to-hand combat with that foremost of Rākshasas, incapableof being slain by the celestials themselves; and achievedvictory (ultimately). To defeat Rāvana in battle was (for thee)a small matter; but it is a piece of good fortune thatRāvana's son, who had confronted thee for combat, hathbeen slain (by thee) in battle. By good fortune it is that thou,O mighty-armed one, hadst been liberated from (the bondsof) that foe of the celestials whose course resembled that ofTime4;—and that thou also hadst secured victory. Hearingof the destruction of Indrajit, we congratulate thee (on thysuccess). He was incapable of being slain by all creatures,and in battle possessed mighty powers of illusion. Hearingthat Indrajit slain, amazement hath seized us all. Havingconferred on us this holy freedom from fear, O Kākutstha,O repressor of enemies, thou through good fortune, wiltgrow in victory.\" Hearing the speech of the ascetics ofsacred souls, Rāma, coming under the influence of a mightywonder, said with joined hands,—\"Ye worshipful ones,wherefore, passing by those exceedingly powerful onesKumbhakarna and the night-ranger, Rāvana—do ye praiseRāvana's son? Wherefore, passing by Mahodara, andPrahasta, and the Rākshasa—Virupaksha—and Matta, andUnmatta, and the irrepressible Devāntaka andNarāntaka—redoubtable heroes all—do ye extoll Rāvana's son? Andwherefore, passing by Atikāya and Triçiras andDhumrāksha,—that night-ranger—all endowed with exceedingprowess,—do you extoll Rāvana's son? What was his prowess? Andwhat his strength? And what his might? And by virtue ofwhat cause did he surpass Rāvana? If I can well hear thesame, (do ye tell it me). I by no means command you. Ifthe thing can bear disclosure, I would hear it. Pray,speak out. How was Sakra vanquished by him, and howalso did he obtain the boon? And how was the sonpowerful,—and not his sire—Rāvana? How could that Rākshasa,surpassing his sire, conquer Sakra in mighty encounter,and how did he obtain the boon? O foremost of anchorets,do thou to-day unfold all this unto me, who ask (for thesame).\""

I shall, O Rāghava,describe unto thee Rāvana's race and birth, as well as theboon that had been conferred on him."

 {
  "Uttara Kānda": "\"Formerly in the Krita age, O Rāma, there was aBrahmarshi—lord (of creatures)—son unto Prajāpati, and likeunto the very self of the great-father. His virtues, springingfrom righteousness and excellency of character, are past alldelineation; I can only say that, forsooth, he went by thename of Prajāpati's son. Verily on account of his being theson of Prajāpati, he was the darling of the deities; as byvirtue of his spotless perfections, that magnanimous one wasloved of all creatures. And on a religious mission thatforemost of ascetics, repairing to the asylum of Trinavinduat the side of the mighty mountain, Meru, took up his abodethere. And with his senses centered on the study of theVedas, that righteous-souled one, going to the hermitage,carried on austerities; but his religious rites were disturbedby certain girls. And daughters of sages and Pannagasand those of Rājarshis,—as well as those of Apsarās, sporting,arrived at that quarter. And on account of every seasonbeing genial at that spot and also of the loveliness ofthe wood, the damsels, repairing to this place, everdisport there. And on account of the beauty of that region,those wenches, coming to where that twice-born one, Pulastyawas, used to sing, to play on instruments, and to dance;and thus those blameless beauties disturbed the rites of thatanchoret practising austerities. Thereat, the mighty ascetic,waxing wroth, said,—'She that comes within my kin, shallconceive.' Hearing the words of the high-souled one, (thedamsels), afraid of a Brāhmana's curse, ceased to haunt thatplace. But Trinavindu's daughter had not heard anythingof all this; and, going to the asylum, she ranged it fearlessly.And she did not see there any of her associates come to thatspot. And at that time that exceedingly energetic andmighty sage, Prajāpati's son, with his soul sanctified throughasceticism, was engaged in the study of the Veda. And,hearing the sounds of Vaidika recitation, and seeing thatstorehouse of asceticism, she had her body turned pale, andsigns of pregnancy displayed themselves. And, seeing thatevil befall her, she was wrought up with anxiety; and,understanding matters, she said,—'What is this?' And,going to her father's hermitage, stayed there. And, seeing herin this condition, Trinavindu said,—'Wherefore is the personthat thou bearest unlike what it used to be?' Thereat, inwoe-begone guise, with joined hands, his daughter repliedunto that one having asceticism for his riches,—'O father,cause know I none whereby I have come by this appearance.But, searching for my associates, I had ere this alone repairedto the noble asylum of the Maharshi Pulastya of a purifiedspirit. But associate found there I none, that had comethither. And seeing this change for the worse of my form,I from fear have come hither.' Thereat the Rajarshi,Trinavindu, having a live effulgence through asceticism,entered into contemplation, and saw the consequence of thesage's act. And coming to know that curse of the Maharshiof a purified spirit, he, taking his daughter, went to Pulastyaand said,—'O worshipful one, O mighty sage, do thou acceptthis daughter of mine, adorned with her native perfections,who of herself hath come to thee as alms.5 She will,without doubt, constantly tend thee, practising asceticism,and having thy senses fatigued.' When that virtuous (sage)had said this, the twice-born Rajarshi, desirous of acceptingthe girl (after due nuptial rites), said unto theformer,—'Well!' Having given away his daughter, the king went(back) to his asylum; and the girl stayed there, gratifyingher husband with her virtues. And that best of ascetics wasgratified with her character and behavior. And well pleased(with her), that highly energetic one said,—'O thou ofshapely hips, well-pleased am I with thee with thy wealthof worth, and therefore, O exalted one, I will to-day conferon thee a son like unto thyself, who will perpetuate boththe lines6—being celebrated as Paulastya. And as thou hadstheard the Veda recited by me, so, without doubt, he shall benamed Viçravā.'7 Thus addressed, that noble damsel withher soul wrought up with delight, in a short time broughtforth her son Viçravā famed over the three worlds andfurnished with virtue and fame; versed in the Vedas, of animpartial spirit, and ever engaged in observing vows. Andthe ascetic, Viçravā, was furnished with asceticism even likehis sire.\""

  "Uttara Kānda": "\"And Pulastya's son—that prime of ascetics—Viçravā—in a shorttime was engaged in asceticism like his father.And he was truthful, and of excellent character and controlledsenses; was ever engaged in the study of the Vedas; and wasof a sanctified spirit; and he was not addicted to any of thepleasures of life, and was always studious of religion.Learning of his ways, that mighty ascetic, Bharadwāja, gaveunto Viçravā for his wife, his own daughter, Devavarnini.And having religiously wed Bharadwāja's daughter, thatforemost of ascetics, Viçravā, conceiving the highest delight,began to reflect on the welfare of his offspring with anintelligence concentrated on them. And on her that onecognizant of righteousness begot a child, exceedinglywonderful, endowed with energy, and adorned with all Brahmā8qualities. On his having been born, his grand-father wasrejoiced, and, marking the profitable intelligence (of the boy,he thought that) he would be the lord of riches. Andwell-pleased, (Pulastya) in company with the Devarshis(thought),—'Inasmuch as this is Viçravā's offspring, and as heresembles Viçravā himself, so he should be known by thename of Vaiçravana. And then the exceedingly energeticVaiçravana, repairing to the wood of asceticism, increased(in power) like unto a fire fed by sacrificial oblations. Andas he was staying in the hermitage, that high-souled onethought,—'I shall practise prime righteousness: verily virtueis the supreme way.' And for a thousand years, he, havinghis senses controlled, practised rigid austerities in thatmighty forest, observing (all the while) the most rigorousrestrictions. And on a thousand years having been numbered,he by turns observed the rules relative to each term; (atfirst) living on water, (then) on air, and (last) goingabsolutely without any fare. Thus passed away a thousand yearslike one. And then the highly energetic Brahmā alongwith Indra and the celestials, coming to that asylum, addressed(Vaiçravana), saying,—'O child, I am well-pleased withthee for this act of thine, O thou of excellent vows. Do thou,good betide thee, ask for the boon (that thou wouldst have),for, O magnanimous one, thou art worthy of a boon. 9 ThenVaiçravana said unto the great-father, who waspresent,—'O reverend one, I crave for the power of maintaining andprotecting people.' Thereat, Brahmā along with the deitiesgladly said in a gratified spirit,—'Very well! I am aboutto create the fourth of the Protectors of creatures—Yama,Indra and Varuna,—the position which is sought for by thee.Do thou, O thou cognizant of righteousness, attain the same;do thou receive the position of the lord of riches. Thoushalt be the fourth among Sakra, the lord of waters, etc.And do thou take for thy vehicle this car, named Pushpaka,resembling the Sun himself, and thus raise thyself to anequality with the celestials. Good betide thee! We shall(now) go whither we had come, having, my child, done myduty and bestowed on thee the couple of boons.' Havingsaid this, Brahmā along with the celestials went to his ownquarters. On the deities with Brahmā at their head, havingdeparted for the heavenly regions, the self-possessed lordof wealth of subdued senses with joined hands spokeunto his sire, saying,—'O reverend one, I have receivedthe wished-for boon from the great-father, but the exaltedlord of creatures hath not fixed any abode for me. Therefore,O lord, do thou seek out some dwelling for me, where nocreature whatever can come by misfortune.' Thus accostedby his son, that best of ascetics, Viçravā, spoke, O righteousone,—'Listen! O excellent one. On the shore of theSouthern sea there is a mount named Trikuta. On its browis a beautiful and broad city built by Viçwakarmā, namedLankā, resembling the city itself of Indra the great, designedfor the abode of Rākshasas,—like unto the Amaravati ofIndra. There in Lankā, do thou, forsooth, reside. Thatromantic city is surrounded with a golden wall and a moat,and is furnished with engines and weapons; and hathgateways of gold and lapises. Formerly she was renounced by theRākshasas afflicted with the fear of Vishnu; and was emptyof swarms of Rakshas, who had gone to the nethermostregions. Now Lankā is vacant,—and there is no one thatlords it over her. Do thou, my child, for abode, at thine easerepair thither. Thy stay there shall meet with no rub, andno manner of disturbance shall occur there.' Hearing therighteous speech of his sire, that virtuous-souled one alongwith thousands of delighted and joyous Rākshasas, began toreside in Lankā stationed on the top of the mount. In ashort time (Lankā), through his sway, abounded (in wealth).And that foremost of Nairitas, the righteous son of Viçravā,well-pleased, abode in Lankā having the Ocean for herentrenchment. At times the righteous-souled lord of riches,mounted on Pushpaka, in humble guise visited his father andmother. And hymned by hosts of deities and Gandharvas,having his mansion graced with the dancing of Apsarās, andfloating on rays like the sun himself, that ruler of richeswent to his sire.\""

And then shaking his head, he, struck withwonder, momentarily eying Agastya, addressed Agastyaresembling fire, saying,—\"O worshipful one, hearing thywords that formerly Lankā had been in the possession of theflesh-eaters, I have been seized with great amazement. Wehad heard that the Rākshasas had sprung in the race ofPulastya. But now thou hast said that they owe their originto a different source. But were they more powerful thanRāvana and Kumbhakarna and Prahasta and Vikata and thesons of Rāvana? Who was their progenitor? And what wasthe name of that one of terrific strength? And through whattransgression were they driven out by Vishnu? All this, Osinless one, do thou tell me in detail, and do thou dispell mycuriosity even as the sun dispells darkness.\""

  "Uttara Kānda": "Hearing Rāghava's words, fair and fraught with polishedphrase and period, Agastya, struck with surprise, said untoRāghava,—\"The lord of creatures sprung from water, firstcreated water. And the lotus-born one generated creaturesfor protecting that element. And thereupon those creatureshumbly presented themselves before the creator,saying,—'What shall we do? We are sore tried by hunger and thirst.'The lord of creatures, laughing, addressed them,saying,—'Ye men, do ye carefully guard this (water).' Thereat somesaid 'Rakshāma,'9 and others 'Yakshāma.'10 Thus accostedby those afflicted with hunger and thirst, the creatorsaid,—'Those among you who have said 'Rakshāma,' shall beRākshasas; and those among you who have said ‘Yakshāma,’shall be Yakshas. And there sprang the brothers—repressorsof foes—Heti and Praheti—lords of Rākshasas, resemblingMadhu Kaitava himself. Praheti, who was righteous, wentto the wood of asceticism. And Heti exerted himself to theutmost to get himself wived. And that magnanimous one ofimmeasurable soul married the exceedingly terrific sister ofKāla, named Bhaya.11 And on her Heti—foremost ofRākshasas and best of those having sons—begat a son,known as Vidyutkeça. And Heti’s son, the exceedinglyenergetic Vidyutkeça, possessed of the splendour of the sun,grew up even like a lotus in water. And when thatnight-ranger arrived at proper youth, his sire turned his attentiontowards his marriage. And that best ofRākshasas—Heti—in the interests of his son asked for the hand of Sandhyā’sdaughter, like unto Sandhyā12 herself in potency. Sandhyā,reflecting that she needs must have to be given awayby her, bestowed her on Vidyutkeça, O Rāghava.Having obtained Sandhyā’s daughter, the night-ranger,Vidyutkeça, sports with her even as Maghavān doth with thedaughter of Pulomā. And it came to pass that after a lengthof time, O Rāma, Sāla Katankatā was filled with child byVidyutkeça, as the clouds are furnished with water by theOcean. And then repairing to Mandara, the Rākshasi broughtforth her child, having the splendour of rain-chargedclouds; even as Gangā had delivered herself of the childbegotten by Fire.13 And having delivered herself of heroffspring, she again became bent on disporting withVidyutkeça. And then forsaking her son, she began to sportwith her husband; and the child having sounds resemblingthe rumbling of clouds, was renounced (by his mother). Andforsaken by them both, the infant furnished with thebrightness of the autumnal sun, entering his clenched fist into hismouth, began to cry slowly. And it so fell that, journeyingwith Pārvati, Siva, riding his bull through the aerial regions,heard the sounds of weeping. And along with Umā, hesaw the Rākshasa’s son, as he was crying. And sent byPārvati, whose heart was moved by compassion,Bhava—destroyer of Tripurā—made that Rākshasa’s offspring attainthe age of his mother, and conferred on him immortality.And for compassing Pārvati’s pleasure, Mahādeva,indestructible and undeteriorating, granted (the Rākshasa) thepower of ranging the air. And, O son of the king, Umā alsobestowed a boon: 'Henceforth the Rākshasis shall conceivein a day, bring forth (child) in a day, and the child shall ina day be furnished with the age of its mother.’ And thenthe great and magnanimous Sukeça, puffed up with thereceipt of the boons, having obtained auspiciousness at thehands of the lord, Hara, began to range everywhere, even asPurandara did on having obtained heaven.\""

  "Uttara Kānda": "\"Seeing Sukeça righteous and furnished with the boon,a virtuous Gandharva, named Grāmani, of the effulgence offire, who had a daughter, called Devavati, like unto a secondSri herself, famed over the three worlds, and endowed withbeauty and youth,—bestowed her on Sukega as if he hadbestowed the goddess of fortune of the Rakshas. And like anindigent person on obtaining wealth, Devavati, on obtainingher beloved husband, affluent in consequence of havingreceived the boon, was (greatly) delighted. And in hercompany, that night-ranger appeared graceful, even as amighly elephant sprung from Anjana14 doth in the companyof a she-elephant. In good time Sukeça, O Rāghava, begot(on her) three sons, resembling the three Fires, And thatlord of Rākshasas begot (on her) three sons, resembling histhree eyes—the Rākshasas Malyavān, Sumāli and thatforemost of the strong—Māli; all resembling the three worldspossessing themselves in calmness; like unto the three Firesestablished; fierce like unto the three vinntras,—dreadfullike three diseases springing respectively from morbid Air,Bile and Phlegm.15 And the sons of Sukeça, having theenergy of the three Fires, grew up like a disease which hathbeen disregarded. And learning that their father hadreceived a boon by virtue of his power proceeding fromasceticism, the brothers, firmly resolved, went to Meru forpractising penances. And adopting rigid restrictions, theRākshasas, O best of kings, entered upon austerities, terrible,and capable of arousing the fear of all beings. Andpractising penances rare on earth with truth and candour andself-control, they afflicted the three worlds with gods, Asurasand human beings. Then that lord—the four-facedone—stationed on a superb car, addressed Sukeça’s sons,saying,—'I am for conferring boons (on you).’ Knowing that Brahmāsurrounded by Indra and the other celestials was ready tobestow boons, they, with joined hands, said, trembling liketrees, ‘O god that hast been adored through asceticism,if thou dost intend to confer on us a boon, let us beinvincible, capable of slaying foes, immortal, lordly, and everdevoted to each other.’ Thereat, saying ‘So be it,’ unto thesons of Sukeça, the lord Brahmā, (ever) cherishing Brāhmanaswith affection, went to the Brahmā regions. O Rāma, havingobtained the boons, those night-rangers, rendered intrepidin consequence of having the boon conferred on them, beganto disturb celestials and Asuras. And like unto men abidingin hell, the celestials, Charanas and hosts of sages, beingharassed (by Rakshasas), did not find any deliverer. And then,O foremost of the Raghus, the Rakshasas, assembled together,joyfully said unto the undeteriorating Viçwakarmā—princeof artists,—‘Thou by thy own energy art the architect of thegreat gods, endowed with energy and prowess and strength.Do thou, O magnanimous one, construct a fabric for us afterour heart hard by Himavān, or Meru, or Mandara. And dothou erect a magnificent mansion for us resembling themansion itself of Maheçwara.’ Thereat Viçwakarmā—themighty-arm of the Rakshasas—spoke of a building like theAmarāvati of Sakra, ‘On the shore of the Southern sea is amountain named Trikuta. A second also is there calledSuvela, ye lords of Rākshasas. On the midmost peak of thatmountain resembling clouds, inaccessible even to thefowls of the air, all the four quarters have been hewn withbones.16 If I am desired by you, I can construct the city ofLankā (there), having an area of thirty Yojanas, andmeasuring an hundred in length; surrounded with a goldenwall and furnished with golden gateways. In her do yedwell, ye irrepressible ones, ye foremost of Rākshasas; evenas do the celestials with Indra, approaching Amarāvati,And occupying the citadel of Lankā, backed by innumerableRākshasas, ye will be invincible to foes and capable ofdestroying them.’ Hearing Viçwakarmā’s speech, thoseforemost of Rakshasas, accompanied by thousands offollowers, went to the palace and set up in the same, havinga strong wall and a moat, abounding in hundreds of goldenedifices. And obtaining Lankā, the night-rangers,exceedingly delighted, began to dwell therein. At this time, ORāghava, there lived at her pleasure a Gandharvi, namedNarmadā. O son of Raghu, she had three daughters,resembling Sri, Hri, and Kirti in splendour. And albeit noRākshasi herself, she, beginning with the eldest, gladlymarried to the Rākshasas her daughters having facesresembling the full moon. And under the influence of thestar, Bhagadaivata, those three exalted daughters of aGandharvi were respectively conferred by their mother on thethree several Rākshasas of eminence. And having wedded,O Rāma, Sukeça's sons began to sport with their wives, likecelestials sporting with Apsarās. Malyavān's beautiful spousewas named Sundari. On her he begot, do thou understand,whom;—Vajramusthi, and Virupāksha, and theRākshasa—Burmukha,—and Suptaghna, and Yajnakopa, and Matta andUnmatta; and, O Rāma, there was also born a lovelydaughter of Sundari, Analā. And Sumāli's wife, of face likethe full Moon, named Ketumati, was dearer to him than hislife itself. O mighty king, do thou, gradually, know theoffspring that were begot by Sumāli on Ketumati,—Prahasta,and Kampana, and Vikata, and Kālikāmukha, andDhumrāksha, and Danda, and the redoubtable Supārcwa, andSanhrādi, and Praghasa, and the Rākshasa, Bhāsakarna, andRākā, and Pashpotkatā, and Kaikasi of luminous smiles,and Kumbhinasi—these are known as the offspring of Sumāli.Māli had for wife a graceful Gandharvi, having eyesresembling lotus-petals, of a lovely look, and like unto themost magnificent Yakshi of them all. Do thou, O master,listen to me as I mention to thee, O Rāghava, the offspring thatSumāli's younger brother begat on her,—Anala, and Nila,and Sampāti. These night-rangers—sons unto Māli—werethe courtiers of Bibhisana. And those three foremost ofRākshasas, accompanied by hundreds ofsons—night-rangers all—elated on account of their measureless prowess, beganto worry the sages and serpents and Yakshas, and celestialswith Indra (at their head). And incapable of being confronted(in battle), these resembling Death himself inenergy,—wondrous elated in consequence of the boon having beenconferred on them, ranging the world like unto the Wind,were ever engaged in disturbing the sacrifices (of the sages).\""

Andcoming to that enemy of Kāma17 and foe of Tripurā—thethree-eyed (Deity), the gods, with their voices falteringthrough fear, represented with joined hands,—'O reverendone, the creatures of the lord of creatures are being (sorely)troubled by the sons of Sukeça, given to harassing theirfoes,—swollen with insolence on account of the boon conferredon them by the great-father, Our asylums,—constitutingour refuges,—have been divested of their power of grantingshelter; and driving off the deities from the etherial regions,they are sporting there like the immortals. 'I am Vishnu!' 'Iam Rudra!' 'I am the king of the celestials!' 'I am Yama!' 'Iam Varuna!' 'I am the Moon!' 'I am the Sun!'—flatteringthemselves in this fashion, Māli and Sumāli and theRākshasa—Malyavān—as well as those going before them, areannoying (the gods), breathing exhilaration of martial spirits.Therefore, god, it behoveth thee to liberate us from fear,who have been greatly tormented by it. Do thou, assumingthy terrific form, slay the thorns of the celestials.\" Thusaddressed by the immortals in a body, that lord, Kaparddiof red-blue hue, reflecting that it would be wrong for him todestroy Sukeça (with his own hands), spoke unto thegods:—\"I shall not slay them, ye gods; they are incapable of beingslain by me. But I shall unfold unto you the way in whichthey will be destroyed. Do ye, ye Maharshis, in the heat ofthis affair, seek the shelter of Vishnu. That lord will slaythem.\" Thereat, saluting Maheçwara with the sounds ofJaya, (the celestials) afflicted with the fear of thenight-rangers, presented themselves before Vishnu. And bowingdown unto the god holding the conch, discus and mace, andpaying him high homage, they, greatly flurried, addressed himabout the sons of Sukeça, saying,—\"O god, by virtue of theboon (that hath been bestowed on them), resembling thethree fires, Sukeça's three sons, assailing us, have deprivedus of our abode. There is a city named Lankā, stationed onthe top of Trikuta, (extremely) difficult of entrance. Takingup their station at that place, the night-rangers in a bodypursue us. Do thou, O slayer of Madhu, destroy them for ourwelfare. We have sought thy shelter. Become our refuge,O foremost of celestials. Do thou dedicate to Yama thelotuses of their faces, severed (in pieces) with thy discus.Save thee, we have none who can, while tormented withfright, inspire us with courage. Slay in encounter the elatedRākshasas along with their adherents; and even as the sundrieth up dew, do thou dispell this fear of ours.\" Thusaccosted by the deities, that god of gods—Janārddana—whobringeth fear unto foes—cheering up the celestials, said untothem,—\"I know the Rākshasa, Sukeça, as flushed with theboon bestowed by Içāna. And I also know his sons, of whomMalyavān is the eldest. Those worst of Rākshasas that haveover-riden your dignity will I, wrought up with wrath, slay(in battle); therefore, ye gods, be of good cheer.\" Thusaddressed by the mighty Vishnu, the gods, highly rejoiced,went to their respective quarters, extolling Janārdana."

 {
  "Uttara Kānda": "\"And hearing of the activity of the celestials, thenight-ranger—Malyavān—addressed his heroic brothers,saying,—'The immortals and sages, going to Sankara, spake thesewords, desirous of our destruction,—The terrific sons ofSukeça, puffed up, and swollen on account of their strengthflowing from the boon, are crossing us at every step. Wehave been overpowered by the Rākshasas. And, O lord ofcreatures, from fear of those wicked-minded ones, we cannotremain in our own homes. Therefore, to do us good, do thou,O three-eyed one, destroy them; and, O best of consumingones, do thou with thy roars, burn them up.—Thus addressedby the deities, the slayer of Andhaka, hearing their speech,said, shaking his head and hands,—Ye gods, Sukeça's sonsare incapable of being slain by me in battle. But I shall tellyou the means whereby they may be slain. Do ye seek theshelter of him who holdeth the discus and mace in his hands,and who is clad in a yellow attire,—of Janārdana, Hari, evenof the auspicious Nārāyana.—Having received this counsel ofHara, they, rendering reverence unto that enemy of Kāma,came to the abode of Nārāyana and communicated everythingunto him. Then Nārāyana spoke unto the celestials withIndra at their head,—I will slay those foes of the celestials.Ye gods, cast off all fear!—O foremost of Rākshasas, Haripromised unto the frightened celestials that he would slayus. Therefore do ye think as to what is fit. Hiranyakaçipuhath met with death (at the hands of Hari), as also otherenemies of the immortals. And Namuchi and Kālanemi, andthat foremost of heroes,—Sanhrāda—and Rādheya, andVahumāyi, and the virtuous Lokapāla, and Yāmala, andArjuna, and Hārdikya, and Sumbha andNiçumbhaka,—Asuras and Dānavas endowed with strength and possessed ofterrific prowess—all these, who, having come to the field, hadnever been heard of as worsted, who had performed hundredsof sacrifices, who had been well skilled in illusion, who hadbeen versed in every branch of knowledge, and who werethe terrors of their foes—have by hundreds and bythousands been destroyed by Nārāyana. Learning this, itbehoveth you to do what would conduce to the behoof ofall. It is a sore task to defeat Nārāyana, who wishethto slay us.' Thereat Sumāli and Māli, hearing the wordsof Mālyavān, said unto their eldest brother, like theAcwins addressing Vāsava,—'We have studied, performedsacrifices, practised charity, and obtained riches; andattaining long health and long life, we have established sterlingrighteousness in our path. And with arms plunging into thesea of celestials, we have conquered our unrivalled enemies.Therefore, we have no fear touching death. Even Nārāyanaand Rudra, Sakra and Yama, ever fear to stay before us (inthe field). And, O lord of Rākshasas, there is no occasion forVishnu's displeasure of us. The mind of Vishnu hath waveredin consequence of the evil caused by the celestials. Thereforewill we even avenge ourselves on the gods, from whom hathsprung this wrong.' Having taken counsel together, thosepowerful ones conciliated their forces. And proclaiming (theirorder) that preparations were to be made, all the foremostNairitas sallied forth for battle, like unto those led by Jamvaand Vritra. And, O Rāma, having thus taken counseltogether, with all the preparations complete, thosehuge-bodied and redoubtable Rakshas marched forth for conflict,mounted on cars, and elephants, and horses resemblingelephants, and mules, and kine, and camels, and purpoises,18and serpents, makaras, and tortoises, and fishes, and fowlsresembling Garuda himself, lions and tigers and boars andSrimaras19 and Chāmaras.20 And puffed up with pride ofprowess, the Rakshas march, leaving Lankā, and the enemiesof the celestials went to the heavenly regions for battle. Andperceiving the destruction of Lankā at hand, those deitiesthat had taken up their quarters there, everywhere were struckwith fear and felt their spirits depressed. And mountingthe best of cars, the Rākshasas by hundreds and thousandswith intent minds swiftly sallied forth for the celestialregions. And the deities (aforementioned) followed the tractof the Rākshasas. And at the command of Kāla, terribleevil omens foreshadowing the destruction of theRākshasa-chiefs began to arise on the earth well as in the sky. Theclouds showered down bones and hot blood. The oceansoverleapt their continents;21 and the mountains shook. Andjackals of terrific forms, having voices resembling theroaring of clouds,—bursting out into a horse-laugh, began toemit cries frightfully. Creatures were one after anotherseen to drop down; and mighty swarms of vultures, withmouths belching forth flames, began to wheel over theRākshasa, like unto Kāla himself. And blood-footed pigeonsand Sārikās22 darted off (around). And crows and two-leggedcats began to cry in loud accents. But fast bound withthe noose of Death, the Rākshasas, proud of their strength,disregarding these omens, march on, and do not stay theircourse,—Mālyavān and Sumāli possessed of prodigiousstrength, going before the Rākshasas, like flaming fires. Andeven as the gods take refuge under Dhata, the night-rangerstake refuge under Malyavān resembling the mountain,Malyavān. And under the command of Māli, that host ofRākshasas, roaring like mighty clouds, inspired with the desireof victory, went to the celestial regions. And the lordNārāyana, hearing of the preparations of the Rākshasas froma celestial messenger, set his heart on fight. And equippedwith weapons and quivers, he mounted on Vinata's offspring.23And donning on his mail furnished with the effulgence of athousand suns, fastening his spotless quivers filled with shafts,being engirt with his waist-band and bright falchion, andequipped with his conch, discus, mace, Sārnga,24 sword,and other superior weapons, that lotus-eyed lord, seated onVinata's offspring like a very mountain, set out speedily forcompassing the destruction of the Rākshasas. And seatedon Suparna's25 back, the blue-brown Hari clad in yellowattire resembled a mass of clouds on the crest of the goldenmountain, with lightning playing through it. And hymnedby Siddhas and celestials and sages and mighty (semi-divine)serpents and Gandharvas and Yakhas, the enemy of theAsura hosts presented himself, bearing in his hands the discus,sword, that weapon—Sārnga—and the conch. And theRākshasa-hosts, struck by the wind produced by the wingsof Suparna, with their pennons swinging to and fro and theirweapons scattered about, quaked like the blue summit of amountain with its crags tossed about.

  "Uttara Kānda": "\"And as clouds assail a mountain with showers, thenthe Rākshasas, representing clouds, setting up shouts, beganto assail Nārāyana representing a mountain. And Vishnu ofa bright brown-blue hue, being surrounded by the flower ofthe night-rangers with dark visages, resembled the mountain,Anjana, on which the clouds pour down. And as locusts(flood) a field, gnats (throng) about a flame, gad-flies (cluster)around a pot of honey, or makaras (range) the deep, so theshafts shot by the bows of the Rakhas, having (the energy of)the thunder-bolt and endowed with (the velocity of) thewind or thought, pierce Hari as if at the universaldissolution. And those mounted on cars (assailed him) with theircars, and those mounted on the backs of elephants (assailedhim) with their elephants, and those riding horses (assailedhim) with their horses, and the foot-soldiers attacked him,stationed in the sky; and the foremost of Rākshasasresembling mountains, by means of darts, rishtis and tomaras,suspended the respiration of Hari even as the prānāyāma27doth that of a twice-born one. On being sore tried by thenight-rangers, like the great Ocean by the fishes (residing init), that invincible one, taking his Sārnga, showered shaftsamong the Rākshasas. And with sharpened arrowsresembling the thunder, and endowed with the velocity of the wind,shot from his bow drawn to its fullest stretch, Vishnu cut off(Rākshasas) by hundreds and by thousands. And dashingaway (the Rākshasa ranks) with his arrowy shower, even asthe wind aroused dasheth away a downpour, that best ofmale beings blew his mighty conch—Pānchajanya. Andwinded by Hari with his utmost might, that water-sprung kingof conchs, endowed with terrific blares, roared, as if afflictingthe three worlds. And the sounds of that king of conchs struckterror into the Rākshasas, even as in a mighty forest a lion(strikes terror into the hearts of) elephants in rut. Andthereat the horses could not keep their ground, and theelephants were reft of their temporal flow, and shorn of theirvirtue at the roars of the conch, heroes began to topple downfrom their cars. And dight with dainty feathered parts havingheads, the shafts discharged from the Sārnga, resemblingthunder-bolts, riving those Rakshas, entered the earth. Andin that conflict, pierced by the arrows discharged fromNārāyana's arm, the Rākshasas began to drop to the groundlike mountains struck with the thunder-bolt. And the woundson the persons of the foes inflicted by the discus of Vishnudischarge blood in streams, like mountains dischargingstreams of red chalk. And the sounds of that king ofconchs, as well as those of the Sārnga, combined with theroars emitted by Vishnu himself, swallowed up the roars ofthe Rākshasas. And Hari by means of his shafts cut off theirnecks, and arrows, and standards, and bows, and cars,and ensigns, and quivers. And like fierce rays streamingabout from the sun, like torrents dashing from the ocean, likeelephants coming down a mountain, or like showersdescending from clouds, the shafts shot by Nārāyana pursue (thefoes) by hundreds and by thousands. And even as anelephant pursueth a tiger, a tiger a wolf, a wolf a dog, a doga cat, a cat a snake, or a snake a rat, so the mighty Vishnupursueth the Rākshasa host; and others, (struck down byhim), measure their lengths on the ground. Then, havingdespatched thousands of Rākshasas, the destroyer of Madhu blewhis water-sprung (conch), even as the sovereign of thecelestials filleth clouds (with rain). And agitated by the arrows ofNārāyana, with their senses bewildered by the blares of theconch, the broken Rākshasa forces made for Lankā. And onthe Rākshasa army having been broken in consequence of thebeating it got at the hands of Nārāyana, Sumāli with showersof shafts resisted Hari in the encounter; and as a mistenvelopes the Sun, he enveloped him (with his arrows).Thereat, the Rākshasas again summoned up their fortitude.And fired with rage, that Rākshasa, inflated with insolenceon account of his strength, setting up a tremendous roar,darted at his antagonist in the conflict, thereby seeming torevive the Rākshasas. And as an elephant flourishes itstrunk, that Rākshasa, lifting up his arm adorned withornaments, began to roar from rapture, like a mass of cloudslighted up with lightning. And (Vishnu) cut off the headflaming with ear-rings of the charioteer of the shoutingSumāli; and thereat the horses of that Rākshasa aimlesslystrayed hither and thither. And with his bewildered steedsSumāli wanders like a person deprived of patience, whosesenses are under a hallucination. And on Sumāli's car beingdrawn at random by his steeds, Māli, taking his bow andequipped therewith, darted at Vishnu's car and assailed thatmighty-armed one as he was descending on the field of fight.And like birds entering the Krauncha,28 the arrows dischargedfrom Māli's bow, graced with gold, hit Hari and entered(into his body). And thereat, as a person holding his sensesunder subjection is not thrown out of his mental balance,Vishnu, assailed in that encounter with thousands of arrowsshot by Māli, was not disturbed ever so little. And then thatcreator of all beings, the reverend Gadādhara,29 twanging hisbow-string, showered vollies of shafts on Māli. And gettingat Māli's body, the arrows furnished with the luminousness oflightning, drink his blood, like unto serpents drinking nectar.And baffling Māli, the holder of the conch, discus, and mace,brought down Māli's crown, standard, bow and steeds. Andthen that foremost of night-rangers, on being deprived of hiscar, sprang forward, mace in hand, even as a lion bounds upfrom the brow of a hillock. And he with his mace smote atthe forehead of that lord of birds, even as the Destroyer hadsmitten Içāna,30 or as Indra smiteth a mountain with histhunder-bolt. On being severely struck by Māli with hismace, Garuda, writhing in torments, moved the god awayfrom the field of battle. On the god having been removedfrom the field by Māli as well as Garuda, there arose a mightydin of Rakshas roaring (in chorus). And hearing thecheers of the Rakshas, Indra's younger brother, the reverendHari, sitting awry on that lord of birds, albeit moved off fromthe scene of conflict, waxing enraged, from a desire of slaying(Māli) hurled his disc at him. And thereat the disc, possessedof the splendour of the solar disc, and resembling the wheel31itself of Kāla, flooding all the heavens with radiance, broughtdown Māli's head to the ground. And that head of the lordof Rākshasas, terrific to behold, on being cut off (by Vishnu),vomitting blood, fell down before (the Rākshasas), as formerlyRāhu's head' had fallen. And then the deities experiencingexcess of joy set up leonine cheers with might and main,crying,—'Excellent, O god.' Seeing Māli slain, Sumāli andMalyavān, burning in grief, fled precipitately towardsLankā along with their forces. And Garuda, being cheered,turned round, and growing enraged, as before drove theRākshasas with the wind of his wings. And (some) with theirlotus-faces cut by the discus, (some) with their chests crushedwith the mace, (some) with their necks torn off by the plough,(some) with their heads riven by the club, and some hewnby the sword, and others pierced by arrows, the Rākshasasbegan to drop fast from the sky into the waters of the ocean.And as the thunder-bolt with lightning (riveth) a mightymass of clouds, Nārāyana by means of the thunder-bolts ofhis arrows discharged from his bow, rived the night-rangerswith their hair dishevelled and streaming (in the wind). Andthe forces having their umbrellas rent, their arms falling off,their goodly garments scattered, their entrails coming out andtheir eyes rolling,—became incapable of distinguishing theirown party from that of the foe. And even like (the roars andthe vehemence) displayed by elephants on being attackedby lions, the roars and the vehemence of the night-rangersand their elephants, sore assailed by the Primaeval Lion,32were equal. And driven by Hari's networks of arrows, anddischarging (all the while) their own showers of shafts, thosenight-rangers resembling the clouds of doom, are driven likethe veritable clouds of the universal dissolution drifted bythe wind. And hewn in twain with swords, the foremostRākshasas fell like unto hills (toppling headlong). And theEarth was seen to be (covered) with night-rangers resemblingdark clouds, adorned with jewelled necklaces andear-rings,—falling down,—as if covered with dark mountains droppingdown.\""

  "Uttara Kānda": "\"On that host being sore pressed at its back byPadmanābha,33 Mālyavān turned back even as the ocean doth onmeeting with its shore. And with his eyes reddened, thatnight-ranger waxing wroth, shaking his head, addressed that primeof male persons—Padmanābha,—saying,—'O Nārāyana, thouart ignorant of the time-honored morality of Kshatriyas; andtherefore like a base wight thou slayest us, desisting fromfight and exercised with fear. O lord of the celestials, hethat commits the crime of slaying one that desists fromfight, cannot go to the celestial regions as the fruit ofmeritorious acts. If thou art bent upon battle, O holder ofthe conch, the discus and the mace, taking up my post (here),I shall see (thy strength). Do thou show (me) the same.'Seeing Mālyavān resembling the mountain, Mālyavān, stay,the powerful younger brother of the sovereign of the celestialsspoke unto him,—'I have removed the fear of the deities,affrighted at you, by promising that I will make root andbranch work with the Rākshasas; and that same promise Iam now fulfilling. I should always lay down my life forserving the celestials; and you I will slay even if ye shouldgo to the nethermost regions.' As that god of gods havingeyes resembling red lotuses was speaking thus, the lord ofRākshasas in high wrath pierced his breast with a dart. Andhurled by the hand of Mālyavān, the dart resonant with bells,appeared graceful on Hari's breast like lightning embosomedin clouds. Thereat drawing out the same dart, that onedear unto the Wielder of the Dart,34 having eyes resemblingred lotuses, aiming at Mālyavān, hurled it at him. Thereatthe dart discharged by the hand of Govinda like unto the Dartdischarged by the hand of Skanda, rushing towards the Rākshasalike a meteor coursing towards the Anjana mountain,descended on the spacious chest of the lord of Rākshasasdecked with the weight of a chain, even as the thunder-clapbursts at the summit of a mountain. And on having his mailrent, Mālyavān was utterly deprived of his senses; but(anon) reposing for a while, he again stood like a movelesshill. Then taking up a javelin made of black iron girt withmany a thorn, he furiously smote that deity on the chest.And that night-ranger delighting in battle, dealing a box atVāsava's younger brother, moved away to a distancemeasuring a bow's length. And now there arose a mighty tumultin the sky of 'Excellent!' 'Excellent!' And having struckVishnu, the Rākshasa also hit Garuda. Thereat Vinatā's son,growing enraged, drove the Rākshasas away with the windof his wings, even as a lusty wind bloweth about sere leaves.And seeing his elder brother driven by the wind producedby the wing's of that bird, Sumāli along with his forces, madefor Lankā. And pushed off by the violence of the wind of(Garuda's) wings, the Rākshasa Mālyavān also, joined byhis own forces, departed for Lankā, covered with shame.Thus, O Rāma, O lotus-eyed one, (the Rākshasas) hadinnumerable warriors beaten down and their foremost leadersslain. And albeit inflated with pride, they, incapable ofcoping with Vishnu, leaving Lankā, went to the netherregions with their wives for dwelling there. O best of theRaghus, these Rākshasas of celebrated prowess, related tothe race of Sālakantankatā, remained under the leadershipof the Rākshasa Sumāli. All those exalted Rākshasas goingunder the name of Paulastya that had been headed bySumāli, Malyavān and Māli, were stronger than Rāvana. Noother than the god Nārāyana, holding the conch, the discusand the mace, could slay those Rākshasas—foes to thecelestials and thorns in the side of the deities. And thou artthat eternal god—the four armed Nārāyana,—the lord,undeteriorating and unconquerable, sprung to exterminate Rākshasas.The creator of beings—that one ever cherishing thoseseeking his refuge—appeareth at times to compass the destructionof marauders, bringing the religion of people to rack andruin.35 Thus, O lord of men, to-day I have truly related untothee at length the origin of the Rākshasas. Again, foremostof the Raghus, do thou understand the matchless birth andpotency of Rāvana and his sons related in detail. And thatpowerful Rākshasa, Sumāli, afflicted with the fear of Vishnu,along with his sons and grand-sons for a long time ranged thenether regions, and the lord of riches resided in Lankā.\""

  "Uttara Kānda": "\"After a while the Rākshasa named Sumāli, coming upfrom the nether regions, began to range all over the earth.And resembling dark clouds, that lord of Rākshasas deckedin ear-rings of burnished gold, taking his daughter like untoSree herself without her lotus, and wandering over the earth,saw the lord of riches journeying in his Pushpaka, going tosee his sire—that lord, the son of Pulastya. And seeingthat one resembling an immortal and like unto fire,journeying on, (Sumāli) struck with amazement, entered the netherregions from the earth. And that mighty-minded onereflected thus,—'By adopting what measure may the welfareof the Rākshasas be brought about, and how can we increase(in power)?' And that great-minded lord of Rākshasas,resembling dark clouds, decked in burnished ear-rings ofgold, then began to reflect. And then the Raksha addressedhis daughter, named Kaikasi, saying,—'O daughter, the timehath come when I should give thee away. Thy youth is aboutto be passed. (Kept back) by the fear of refusal, no suitorhath sought thee (up to this time). But desirous of acquiringreligious merit, we are striving our best in thy interests. Mydaughter, thou art furnished with every perfection like untoSree herself. The being father to a daughter is misery toevery one that seeketh honor. O daughter, one doth notknow who shall ask for one's daughter. Wherever may adaughter be conferred, a daughter stayeth, placing inuncertainty the three races36 to which she is related. Do thou,my daughter, seek for thy husband that best and foremost ofascetics sprung in the line of Prajapati—Pulastya'sson,—Viçrava, and of thyself accept him (for thy lord). And then,O daughter, even as is this lord of riches, so thou wilt, withoutdoubt, have sons resembling the Sun himself in energy.'Hearing that speech of his, the daughter for the sake of the dignityof her sire, going to where Viçrava was practising penances,stood there. In the meanwhile, O Rāma, that twice-bornone—Pulastya's son—was performing the Agnihotra, like the fourthFire itself. And without minding that terrific time, (Kaikasi),having regard to the dignity of her sire, coming up beforehim, stood (there) hanging her head down towards his feetand throwing up the earth with her great foe. And seeingthat one of shapely hips, having a face fair as the full Moon,(that exceedingly high-minded ascetic) flaming in energyaccosted her thus,—'O gentle on, whose daughter art thou?And whence dost thou come hither? And what is thyerrand? And for whom (dost thou come)? O beauteous(damsel), truly tell me this.' Thus addressed, the girl,with joined hands, said,—'O ascetic, thou art competent toget at my intent by virtue of thy own power. Yet, OBrahmarshi, know me as having come here at the mandate ofmy sire. My name is Kaikasi. The rest do thou readthyself.' And thereupon, the ascetic, entering intocontemplation, said these words,—'O gentle lady, I have learnt thepurpose that is in thy heart. O thou having the gait of amad elephant, there reigns a powerful desire in thee forhaving offspring. Inasmuch as thou hast come to me at thisfierce hour, hearken, thou amiable one, as to the kind ofoffspring that thou shalt bring forth. Thou shalt, O thou ofgraceful hips, bring forth terrible and grim-visaged Rākshasasdelighting in frightful friends, and of cruel deeds.' Hearinghis speech, she, bowing down, said,—'O reverend (ascetic),such sons of terrific ways seek I not from thee that followestthe Veda. Therefore it behoveth thee to favor me.' Onbeing thus besought by the girl, Viçrava—best ofascetics—again addressed Kaikasi, like the full Moon addressingRohini,37—'O fair-faced one, the son that thou bringest forthlast, shall be like unto my line,—he shall, without doubt—berighteous-souled.' Having been thus accosted, the girl, ORāma, after a length of time brought forth a very terrible andhideous offspring having the form of a Raksha,—having tennecks, furnished with large teeth, and resembling a heap ofcollyrium, with coppery lips, twenty arms, huge faces, andflaming hair. On his having been born, jackals with flamingmouths and other ferocious beasts began to gyrate on theleft. And that god showered down blood; and the cloudsuttered forth harsh sounds. And the Sun was deprived of hissplendour; and meteors began to dart to the earth. And theearth shook; and the wind swept away violently. And thatlord of streams—the ocean, which was calm before, becameagitated. And his sire resembling his grand-father namedhim, (saying),—'As this one hath been born with ten necks,he shall be called Ten-necked.' After him was bornKumbhakarna endowed with prodigious strength, than whoseproportions there are none other's on earth. Then was bornshe that, having a frightful visage, goeth under the name ofSurpanakhā; the righteous Bibhishana is the youngest son ofKaikasi. On that one endowed with great strength havingbeen born, blossoms were showered down from heaven; andcelestial kettle-drums were sounded in the heavenly regions.And then there arose the sounds of 'Excellent!' 'Excellent!'And in that extensive forest those exceedingly energeticones—Kumbhakarna and the Ten-necked one grew up,—andbecame the sources of anxiety to people. And Kumbhakarna,maddened to the height, devouring mighty saints devoted toreligion, constantly ranged the triune world in a dissatisfiedspirit. But the righteous Bibhishana, ever intent on piety,dwelt there, studying the Veda, restraining his fare, andcontrolling his senses. And it came to pass that after alength of time the god, Vaiçravana—lord of riches—came tosee his sire, mounted on Pushpaka. Seeing him, theRākshasi—Kaikasi—flaming up in energy, coming to theTen-necked one, represented to him,—'O son, behold thybrother, Vaiçravana, enfolded in effulgence; and, albeit ofequal fraternity, behold thee in this plight! Therefore, OTen-necked one, O thou of measureless prowess, do thou sostrive that thou also, my son, may be like Vaiçravana himself.Hearing that speech of his mother, the powerful Ten-neckedone was wrought up with exceeding great ill-will, and he vowedthen,—'I truly promise unto thee that I will be equal to mybrother (in energy), or excel him in it. Therefore do thoucast off this sorrow that is in thy heart.' And influenced bythat passion, the Ten-necked one with his younger brotherbegan to perform rigid acts, with his mind fixed on asceticism.'I must through austerities have my wish,' thus fixed andresolved, he for compassing his end, came to the sacredasylum of Gokarna. And there the Rākshasa of unrivalledprowess along with his younger brother carried on austeritiesand thus gratified that lord—the great-father. And beingsgratified (with him), he conferred on him boons bringing onvictory.\""

  "Uttara Kānda": "Then Rāma spoke unto the ascetic,—\"O Brāhmana, howdid those exceedingly mighty brothers carry on austeritiesin that forest; and what kind of penances were theirs?\"Thereat there Agastya said unto Rāma of a complacentmind,—\"The brothers severally observed the morality properto each. And Kumbhakarna, putting forth his best energies,constantly abode in the path of righteousness. Andremaining in the midst of five fires in summer, he practised austerities,and in the rainy season, soaked in water (poured down) byclouds, he sat in the heroic attitude.38 And in winter he alwaysremained in the water. Thus passed away ten thousandyears of that one putting forth exertions in behalf of religion,and established in the path of honesty. And the virtuousBibhishana, ever intent on virtue and pure of spirit, remainedstanding on one leg for five thousand years. And when hehad completed (his term of restriction), swarms of Apsarāsdanced, and blossoms showered, and the deities hymned(him). And for five thousand years, he adored the Sun, andwith his mind concentrated in the study of the Veda, remainedwith his head and hands raised up. In this wise Bibhishanalike a deity in Nandana passed away ten thousand years,observing restrictions. And the Ten-necked one passed tenthousand years without fare. On a thousand years beingcomplete, he offered his own head as a sacrifice to Fire. Inthis way he passed away nine thousand years; and nine ofhis heads entered into Fire. And as in the tenth year heintended to strike off his tenth head, the Great-fatherpresented himself at that place. And well-pleased, the Great-fathercame there along with the celestials. 'O Ten-necked one,'said (the Great-father), 'I am well-pleased with thee. Do thou,O thou cognizant of righteousness, at once ask for the boonthat thou wishest to have. What wish of thine shall I realize?Thy toil must not go for nothing.' Thereat, the Ten-neckedone, bowing down his head unto the deity, said with a delightedheart,—his words faltering with ecstacy,—'O Reverend one,creatures have no other fear than (that of) death; and enemythere is none that is like unto death. Therefore immortalityis even what I crave for.' Thus accosted, Brahmā spoke untothe Ten-necked one,—Thou canst not be immortal. Do thoutherefore ask of me some other boon.' Thus addressed by thecreator, Brahmā, the Ten-necked one, O Rāma, standingbefore him with joined hands, said,—'O lord of creatures, Iwould, O eternal one, be incapable of being slain by birds andserpents, Yakshas, Daityas, Dānavas and Rākshasas, and thedeities; for, O thou that art worshipped by the immortals,anxiety I have none from any other beings. Indeed, I deemas straw creatures such as men etc.' Thus accosted by theRaksha—the Ten-necked one—that righteous-souled one, theGreat-father, along with the celestials, said,—'O foremost ofRākshasas, what thou sayest shall come to pass.' Having,O Rāma, said this unto the Ten-necked one, theGreat-father (again spoke),—'Hear! I, having been gratified, willconfer on thee a fresh boon. O Rākshasa, O sinless one,those heads of thine which have been offered as sacrifices andwhich have sunk into the fire, shall again be thine. And,O placid one, I shall also confer on thee another boon difficultof being obtained,—The form that thou shalt wish to wear,shall instantly be thine. As soon as the Ten-necked Rakshahad spoken thus, the heads that had been offered as sacrificesinto the fire, rose up again. Having said this unto theTen-necked one, the Great-sire of all creatures addressedBibhishana, saying,—'O Bibhishana, gratified have I been bythee, whose intelligence is established in righteousness.Therefore, my child, O righteous-souled one, O thou ofexcellent vows, ask for the boon that thou wouldst have.'Thereat the virtuous Bibhishana spoke with joinedhands,—'O reverend one, since the spiritual preceptor of all creatureshimself (is pleased) with me,—I (deem myself) as furnishedwith every perfection, even as the Moon is environed withrays. If thou wilt bestow on me a boon with pleasure, then,thou of excellent vows, hear of the boon that I would have.May my mind remain fast fixed on righteousness, even whenI shall happen to fall into high peril; and may I attainBrahmā knowledge without any instructions! And may everysense of mine sprung during the observance of particularmodes of life, be in unison with righteousness,—so that I maypractise the form of religion (in harmony with any particularmode of life!) O exceedingly noble one, this best of boons,is even what is sought for by me, for nothing in this world isincapable of being attained by those attached torighteousness.' Then the lord of creatures, being again delighted,spoke unto Bibhishana,—'As thou art virtuous, so all this shallcome to pass on thy behalf. And inasmuch as in spite of thyhaving been born in the Rākshasa race, thy thoughts, Odestroyer of enemies, do not originate in sin, I confer on theeimmortality.' Having said this, he intended to grant boonsunto Kumbhakarna. Thereat the celestials in a bodyrepresented to the lord of creatures with joined hands,—'OnKumbhakarna thou shouldst confer no boons, since thouknowest in what manner doth this wicked-minded one frightenpeople. And, O Brahman, seven Apsarās in Nandana, tenattendants of Mahendra, as well as sages and human beings,have been devoured by this one. Considering what this Rākshasadid when he had not obtained any boon whatever, if he obtainone now he shall eat up the three worlds. Do thou then,O lord having immeasurable prowess, pretending to give him aboon, give stupifaction (instead). Thereby the welfare of peoplewould be secured, and the honor of this one too shall bemaintained.' Thus addressed by the celestials, Brahmā, theLotus-sprung one, pondered. The goddess, Saraswati, who was by hisside was also agitated with anxiety. And remaining by him,Saraswati with joined hands observed,—‘O god, I have comehere. What work shall I accomplish?’ And the lord ofcreatures, on having her, spake unto 'Saraswati,—‘O Vāni!39be thou the goddess of speech of this foremost of Rākshasas,40favorable unto the deities. Having said,—‘So be it,’ sheentered (within Kumbhakarna’s throat); and Prajāpatisaid,—‘O Kumbhakarna, O mighty-armed one, do thou askfor the boon that thou wouldst have. Hearing those words,Kumbhakarna said,—‘O god of gods, my wish is that I maysleep for a good many years.’ Thereupon, saying,—‘So be it,’Brahmā along with the celestials went away; and the goddess,Saraswati, also again left the Rākshasa. And on Brahmāaccompanied by the deities going to the celestial regions, hewas renounced by Saraswati, and then he regained hisconsciousness. And then the wicked-minded Kumbhakarnasorrowfully thought,—‘What is this speech that has to-daycome out from my lips? Meseems I had then been stupifiedby the deities that had come.’ Having thus obtained theboons, the brothers endowed with flaming energy, going to theSleshmātaka wood, began to dwell there peacefully.\""

  "Uttara Kānda": "\"Learning that these night-rangers had obtained boons,Sumāli with his followers, casting off fear, rose up from thenether regions. And wrought up with exceeding great wrath,the counsellors of that Raksha—Māricha and Prahasta andVirupāksha and Mahodara—also rose up. And accompaniedby his counsellors—foremost of Rākshasas—Sumāli presentinghimself before the Ten-necked one and embracing him,addressed him, saying,—‘By good fortune it is, O child, that throughthee we have had the wish that was in our heart, inasmuchas thou hast received the best of boons from him that is theforemost in all these three worlds. O mighty-armed one, thatgreat fear arising from Vishnu, from which leaving Lankā,we had gone to the nethermost abysses, hath been removed.Full many a time, brought down by that fear, we, on beingpursued (by our enemies), forsaking our homes, had gone tothe nether regions along with all those (related to us). ThisLankā was our city, inhabited by Rākshasas. (Now) it isinhabited by thy brother—the intelligent lord of riches. Omighty-armed one, if thou canst through self-control or charityor by a sudden display of prowess, repossess thyself of thesame, a (great) thing shall have been achieved; and then,O child, thou shouldst, without doubt, be the lord of Lankā;and this Rākshasa race, which hath sunk, shall have been raisedup by thee. And, O thou endowed with prodigious strength,thou shalt be the lord of all.’ Then the Ten-necked oneaddressed his maternal grand-father, who was present,saying,—‘The lord of riches is our superior; therefore thou oughtnot to speak thus.’ On that dignified Rākshasa-chief havingthrough moderation thus passed it by, that Raksha,understanding his intent, did not then say anything more. Andit came to pass that when Rāvana had resided there fora time, Prahasta addressed him in a humble speech,—'OTen-necked one, O long-armed (hero), it doth not behove theeto speak thus. Fraternal feeling there is none among heroes.Listen to these words of mine! There were twosisters—Aditi and Diti. And mutually attached to each other, those(damsels) endowed with surpassing beauty, became the wivesof that lord of creatures—Kaçyapa. And Aditi brought forththe gods,—who are the lords of the three worlds. AndDiti gave birth to the Daityas,—offspring of Kaçyapa. Othou cognizant of righteousness, formerly this earth, O hero,having the ocean for her garment, and furnished withmountains, belonged to the Daityas; and (gradually) theygrew very powerful. And then this undeteriorating triuneworld was brought under the dominion of the celestials. Sothat thou art not the only one that would act inimically (tothy brother); but this course had formerly been pursued byboth the celestials and the Asuras. Therefore do thou act inconformity with my word.' Thus exhorted, the Ten-neckedone, with a delighted heart, reflecting for a moment, said,‘Very well.' And wrought up with delight, the Ten-neckedone endowed with prowess the very same day went to theforest, accompanied by the night-rangers. And arriving atTrikuta, that one skilled in speech—the night-ranger,Rāvana—sent Prahasta in the capacity of an ambassador: ‘OPrahasta, hie thee; and tell the foremost of Nairitas—the lordof riches—in my words informed with mildness,—This cityof Lankā, O king, belongs to the high-souled Rakshasas; butthou hast established thyself in her. This, O sinless one, isnot proper for thee. Therefore, O thou of unrivalled prowess,if thou shouldst render the same (back), I shall be highlygratified; and righteousness also thou wilt maintain.—’Thereupon, repairing to Lankā, well-protected by the giver of riches,Prahasta communicated these words unto the highly generousruler of riches,—‘O thou of excellent vows, I have been sentto thee by thy brother, the Ten-necked one, O long-armedone, O foremost of those versed in all branches of learning,do thou listen to my words, O lord of wealth,—and what theTen-faced one says,—This beautiful city, O thou furnishedwith expansive eyes, was formerly inhabited by Rākshasas ofdreadful prowess headed by Sumāli; and for that reason, Oson of Viçrava, he asks thee this. Do thou, my child, grantthis unto him, who is humbly begging for it.’—Hearing thesewords from Prahasta, the god Vaiçravana, best of thoseskilled in speech, answered the former, saying,—‘My fatherhad given this unto me, when it had been emptied ofnight-rangers; and, O Raksha, I have inhabited this place,furnished with charity, honor, and other virtues. Go and tellthe Ten-necked one, as this city and this kingdom are mine,so they are thine, O mighty-armed one. Do thou enjoy thiskingdom without a foe. May my kingdom and wealth neverundergo division when thou art present!’ Having said this,the lord of riches sought the side of his sire,—and, payinghim reverence, he communicated Rāvana’s wish unto him:'My father, this Ten-necked one had sent a messenger to me,saying,—Give (back) the city of Lankā, which had beforebeen inhabited by hosts of Rakshas.—Now, O thou ofexcellent vows, do thou tell me what I should do.’ Thusaccosted, that foremost of ascetics, theBrahmarshi—Viçrava—spoke unto the lord of riches (standing) with joinedhands,—‘O son, listen to my words. The mighty-armed Ten-neckedone had (once) spoken in my presence (to that effect).Thereat I greatly rebuked that wicked-minded one; and I saidagain and again in anger,—Thou disregardest (thy religionand honor). Do thou listen to my words fraught with religionand profit. Of a wicked heart, thou, with thy understandingspoilt in consequence of the granting of the boon, canstnot distinguish between those deserving honor and those not;and, further, through my curse, thou hast come by a fiercenature. Therefore, O mighty-armed one, go to the mountain,Kailaça. Do thou, along with thy retainers, for the purposeof dwelling there, take up thy quarters (there). There floweththe Mandākini—best of streams, with her water covered withgolden lotuses resembling suns, as also with lilies and bluelotuses and various other fragrant flowers. And comingthere frequently, celestials with Gandharvas and Apsarās andserpents and Kinnaras, ever sport there, O lord of riches,thou ought not to enter into hostilities with that Raksha.Thou knowest how he hath obtained a great boon.' Thusaddressed, Viçravana, for the sake of his father's dignity, withhis wives and sons, with his counsellors and his vehiclesand wealth went (to Kailaça). And Prahasta, going (back),joyfully spoke unto the high-souled Ten-necked one, (seated)with his counsellors and his younger brothers,—'The cityof Lankā is (now) empty. Renouncing her, the bestower ofriches hath gone out of her. (Now) entering into her, alongwith us, do thou there maintain thine own religion.' Thusaddressed by Prahasta, the redoubtable Ten-necked oneentered the city of Lankā with his brothers and forces andfollowers. And then even as the lord of the celestialsascends heaven, that foe of the immortals ascendedLankā well-divided by highways,—which had beenforsaken by the lord of wealth. And having been installed,that night-ranger—the Ten-faced one—dwelt in that city; andthat city teemed with night-rangers resembling dark clouds.And the lord of riches, for the sake of his father's dignity,dwelt in a palace situated on the hill bright as moon-light,graced with ornamented superb piles; even as Purandaradwells in Amaravati.\""

Then that Rākshasabestowed his sister, the Rākshasi Surpanakhā, on that lord ofthe Dānavas and king of the Kālakas—Vidyujjibha. Andhaving given her away, the Raksha was wandering about forthe purpose of hunting, when, Rāma, he happened to seeDiti's son, named Maya. And seeing him accompanied byhis daughter, that night-ranger—the Ten-necked one—askedhim, saying,—'Who art thou that (wanderest) alone inthis forest devoid of men as well as deer? And art thouaccompanied by this one having the eyes of a young deer?'Thereat Maya, O Rāma, answered that night-ranger, whenhe had asked this,—'Listen. I shall tell thee all about this.Thou mayst ere this have heard of an Apsarā named Hemā.She like unto the Paulomi of Satakratu was bestowed on meby the gods. And I passed a thousand years, being devotedto her. Thirteen years have passed away since she had goneon a business of the celestials, as also the fourteenth year.Then I through my extraordinary skill constructed a goldenpalace, adorned with diamonds and lapises. There I dwelt,aggrieved and sorrowful on account of her separation. Fromthence, taking my daughter, I have come to this wood. This,O king, is my daughter, grown in her womb. I have comehither with her, seeking for her husband. Verily being fatherto a daughter is misery to every one that seeketh one's honour.A daughter, forsooth, stayeth, ever placing the two lines41in uncertainty. And on this wife of mine I have also begattwo sons;—the first is Māyāvi and the next Dundubhi. Thushave I truly related everything unto thee that hadst asked for it.But, my child, how can I know thee now? Who art thou?'Thus addressed, the Raksha humbly said,—Ten-necked byname, I am the son of the ascetic, Paulastya, who was bornas the third son of Brahmā.' Thus accosted, O Rāma, by thatlord of Rākshasas, that Dānava and foremost of Dānavas,Maya, learning that he was the son of the Maharshi, Paulastya,there desired in his heart to give away his daughter to him.And taking her hand with his own, Maya—lord ofDaityas—laughing, said unto that lord of the Rlkshasas,—'Thisdaughter of mine, O king, borne by the Apsarā, Hemā, thismy daughter named Mandodari do thou accept as thy wife.''Well' thereupon the Ten-necked answered him, O Rāma.And lighting a fire, he took her hand. Maya, O Rāma, knewthe curse of the sage touching him.42 Knowing this, he gaveaway his daughter, having regard to the race of Rāvana'spaternal grand-father; and he also conferred on him anexceedingly wonderful dart acquired through the most rigidausterities,—by which he wounded Lakshmana. Having thuswedded, that master—Lankā's lord—going (back) to that city,married his brothers. And Rāvana married the grand-daughterof Virochana (on the maternal side) named Vajrajwālā, toKumbhakarna.—And Bibhishana obtained for his wife therighteous (damsel) named Saramā—daughter unto thehigh-souled—Sailusha—sovereign of the Gandharvas. (Saramā)was born on the shores of the lake, Mānasa. And while thelake, Mānasa, was swollen with water on the arrival of therains, her mother, hearing her cries, affectionatelysaid,—Saromāvarddhata—'O lake, do not swell,' and from thiscircumstance, her name became Saramā. Having thuswedded, those Rākshasas, taking each his wife, set aboutsporting there, like unto Gandharvas sporting in Nandana.And then was born Mandodari's son—Meghanāda. Him yecall Indrajit. As soon as he was born, Rāvana's son, formerlycrying, emitted a tremendous roar resembling the rumblingof clouds. And, O Rāghava, Lankā was petrified at hisvoice; and (accordingly) his sire himself kept his name,Meghanāda. And, O Rāma, remaining hidden like a fire byfuel, Rāvana's son, rejoicing (the bosoms of) his father andmother, grew up in Rāvana's elegant inner apartments.\""

And then Kumbhakarna spokeunto his brother, who was seated,—'O king, Sleep obstructsme. Do thou, therefore, have my mansion made.' And,thereupon, employed by the king, architects resemblingViçwakarmā constructed an edifice beautiful to behold,measuring the smooth space of a Yojana diagonally and two inarea; graceful to the view, and having no obstruction (to hide itsbeauty). And the Rākshasa caused a splendid and delightfulpile to be built, adorned all round with pillars decked withgold and crystal,—having stairs composed of lapises, furnishedwith networks of small bells, set with ivory gateways, andcontaining daises dight with diamonds and crystal,—elegantthroughout, and enduring,—like unto a goodly cave ofMaru. And there, overcome with slumber, the wondrousstrong Kumbhakarna, lying down for many thousand years,did not wake up. And while Kumbhakarna was overpoweredby sleep, Daçānana43 without let began to destroy Devarshis,Yakshas and Gandharvas,—and going to graceful gardens,Nandana, etc., he devastated them (ruthlessly). And thatRākshasa spread destruction, even as an elephant sportingagitates a river, as the wind bringeth down trees, or as thethunder-bolt riveth mountain-peaks. Hearing of the doingsof Daçagriva,44 and remembering his conduct chiming inwith his race, the righteous lord ofriches—Vaiçravana—showing his fraternal affection, despatched a messenger toLankā, seeking the welfare of Daçagriva. And going to thecity of Lankā, he presented himself before Bibhishana. Andhaving received him with honor, he asked him as to the causeof his visit. And having enquired after the welfare of the kingas well as his kindred, Bibhishana, showed him unto Daçānanaseated in his court. And seeing the king there flaming inhis own energy, he (the messenger), saluting him (Rāvana)with the word—Jaya45—stood silent. And the envoyaddressed Dacagriva seated on a superb couch, graced with a costlycoverlet,—'O king, I shall tell thee all that thy brother hathsaid, worthy of both the character and race of your father andmother,—Enough of wrong-doing. Now thou shouldst mendthy ways. If thou canst, stay in righteousness. I have seenNandana ravaged; and I have heard of the sages slain, andO king, of the preparations the deities are making againstthee. I have been utterly disregarded by thee; but even if aboy should transgress, he should for all that be protected byhis friends. Self-restrained and controlling my senses, I,adopting a terrific vow, had gone to the breast of the Himavānfor practising righteousness. There I saw that lord of the godsin company with Umā. There I happened to cast my left eyeon the goddess, for knowing, O mighty king, who shewas,—and not for any other reason. Rudrāni was stayingthen, wearing a surpassing form. Thereupon through thedivine energy of the goddess my left eye was burnt andseemed to be covered with dust, and its lustre became tawny.Then I, going to another spacious peak of the mountain,became engaged in silently observing a mighty vow. Onmy term of restraint having been complete, that lord of thegods—Maheçwara—with a gratified heart addressed me,saying,—O righteous one, O thou of fair vows, I amwell-pleased with this asceticism of thine. I also had observedthis vow; and thou also, O lord of riches, hast done the same,A third person there is none that practiseth such a vow.This vow is hard to perform, and formerly it was I thatintroduced it. Therefore, O mild one, O lord of riches, dothou contract friendship with me. And thou hast conqueredme by thy penances. Therefore, O sinless one, be thou myfriend. And this thy left eye hath been burnt through theenergy of the goddess, and hath turned tawny in consequenceof having seen the grace of the goddess; so thy name shallever be Ekākshipingali.—Then at Sankara's command I haveobtained the privilege of companionship (with him). Havingcome here I have heard of thy evil designs. Do thou thendesist from this impious course, tending to sully thy line,The celestials along with the sages are pondering over themeans of compassing thy death.—' Thus addressed, theTen-necked one, with his eyes reddened in wrath, rubbing hishands and knashing his teeth, said,—'O messenger, I havelearnt what thou hast uttered. Neither thou nor this brotherof mine by whom thou hast been despatched, (shall live);nor doth the keeper of riches say what is for my good. Andthe fool makes me hear the circumstance of his having madefriends with Maheçwara. I shall never forgive what thouhast said. Up to this I had borne him, considering that he,being my elder brother and as such my superior should notbe slain by me. But now hearing his (utterances), even thisis my resolve. Depending upon the might of my arms, Ishall conquer the three worlds. On his account solely Ishall on the instant despatch the four Lokapālas to the abodeof Death.' Having said this, Lankā's lord killed the emissarywith his sword and made him over to the wicked Rākshasasfor being eaten.

And leaving behind cities andstreams and hills and woods and groves, he in a momentcame to the mountain—Kailaça. And hearing thatwicked-minded lord of Rākshasas, breathing high spirits, had arrivedat the mount in company with his counsellors, the Yakshascould not stay before that Raksha,—and knowing 'This oneis the king's brother'—went to where the lord of riches was.Going to him they in full related all about the doings of hisbrother. And on being permitted by the bestower oftreasures, they went out for battle. And then, like unto theagitation of the ocean, there took place a mighty ferment ofthe forces of the Nairita king, as if making the mountaintremble. And then there took place an encounter betweenthe Yakshas and the Rākshasas; and therein the councillorsof the Rākshasa were smitten fiercely. And finding his forcesin that plight, Daçagriva set up full many a cheerful shoutand in wrath began to speak. Of the councillors of theRākshasa-chief, each coped with a thousand Yakshas. Andthen struck with maces and clubs and swords and darts andtomaras, the Ten-necked one dived into (that deep) of ahost. And rendered inert and sore assailed, Daçānana wasdeprived of his movements with vollies of weaponsremembling torrents of rain. And albeit drenched with bloodstreaming down in hundreds of torrents, he like a mountainflooded with a downpour, being wounded with the weaponsof the Yakshas,—doth not betray any smart. And thathigh-souled one, raising up his mace resembling the rod itself ofTime, entered into that army, despatching Yakshas to theabode of Yama. And as a flaming fire burneth up anextensive sward of grass stocked with dry fire-wood, hebegan to consume that Yaksha army. And as the windscattereth clouds, the small remnant of Yaksha army wasscattered by the redoubtable councillors(of Rāvana)—Mahodara, Suka, etc. And some were wounded, and (some)broken down, and (some) measured their lengths on theground in the encounter, and other Yakshas deprived oftheir arms in the field, being fatigued, sank down, embracingeach other, even as banks drop down, on being worn away bywater. And no room was left (in the sky) in consequence ofits being thronged by hosts of sages; and warriors, woundedand rushing for conflict, and (finally) ascending heaven.47And finding the foremost Yakshas endowed with greatstrength give way, the mighty-armed lord of riches dispatched(other) Yakshas. In the meantime, O Rāma, a Yaksha namedSanyodhakantaka, accompanied by an extensive force and alarge number of vehicles,—on being despatched, rushed (onthe foe). And wounded in the conflict (by Sanyodhakantaka)with his discus, as if by Vishnu himself, Māricha toppleddown to the ground from the mountain, like unto a planetwhose merit hath waned, And in a moment regaining hisconsciousness and resting (for a while), that night-rangerfought with the Yaksha; and thereat, on being defeated, he48fled. Then (Rāvana) entered within the gate-way (of thepalace), garnished with gold, and decked with lapises andsilver, And thereat, O king, the warder named Suryyabhānuprevented the night-ranger—Daçagriva—as he was entering.And albeit prevented, the night-ranger entered in. Andwhen, O Rāma, that Rākshasa was prevented, he did not stay.And then struck by that Yaksha with the gate-way uprooted,he, discharging blood in streams, looked like a hill withminerals running on it. And hit with that gate-wayresembling a mountain-summit in splendour, that hero did not sustainany injury, on account of the boon he had received from theSelf-sprung. And on being struck by the same gate-way,the Yaksha ceased to be seen, his body having then beenconsumed to ashes. And witnessing the prowess of theRaksha, all began to flee; and then they afflicted with affright,fatigued, and with pale faces, entered into rivers and caves,leaving their arms behind.\""

Andattacking the Rākshasas with maces and clubs and beardeddarts, and with darts tomoras and bludgeons, the Yakshasrushed at (their adversaries). And fast safely whirling aboutlike hawks, they fought fiercely. And (some) said, 'Well, giveme battle,' and (others), 'I don't want,' and (others, again),'Let me have (fight)'. And then the celestials and theGandharvas and the sages studying the Vedas, beholding thegreat encounter, were filled with mighty amazement. And athousand of the Yakshas were slain by Prahasta in theconflict; and another thousand of capable warriors were slain byMahodara. And O king, in the twinkling of an eye Māricha,waxing wroth and eager for encounter brought down twothousand (of enemy's soldiers). Where is the candid-coursingfight of the Yakshas and where the fight of the Rakshas byhelp of the power of illusion; and therefore in that battlethe advantage was on the side of the Rākshasas. AndDhumrācksha, confronting Mānibhadra in the mighty conflict hit himat the chest with a bludgeon; but he did not move thereat.And then Mānibhadra dealt the Rākshasa a blow with his mace;and thereat Dhumrācksha smit at the head fell down senseless(on the ground). And seeing Dhumrāckhsa wounded anddown, bathed in blood, the Ten-necked one rushed atMānibhadra in the encounter. And then that foremost of Yakshashit Daçānana with three darts as he was rushing in wrath.And on being thus hit, (Rāvana) struck at Mānibhadra'shead; and at that stroke his crown was depressed at oneside. And from that day forth that Yaksha remained withhis head hollow on one side. And on the high-souledMānibhadra having been baffled, a great uproar, O king, rose inthat mountain. And then at a distance, the lord of riches,mace in hand, accompanied by Sukra and Praushthapadaand Padma and Sanka saw (Rāvana) in the field. Andseeing his brother in the encounter with his glory obscuredthrough the curse (he had ere this come by), the intelligent(lord of Yakshas) spoke in words worthy of the line of hisgrand-father,—'As, O wicked-minded one, thou desistestnot, albeit forbidden by me, thou shalt, afterwardsattaining the fruit of this, and repairing to hell, know (thefate that followeth thee). That perverse one, that throughignorance having drunk poison, neglects to adopt propermeasures, knoweth the consequence of his act ultimately.The gods have set their face against thee on account ofa certain misdeed of thine; and having for this, beenreduced to this condition, thou dost not understand things.He that dishonoreth his father and mother49 and spiritualpreceptor, reapeth the fruit of his act on coming under thesway of the sovereign of the dead. Having regard thatthis body is uncertain, that foolish person, that doth notacquire asceticism, dying goeth the way that he deserveth.The mind of a perverse man doth not willingly inclinetowards good; and he reapeth as he soweth. In thisworld people, making their own good fortune and beauty,strength, sons, wealth and valor, gain these by virtue oftheir pious acts. Being given to such iniquitous acts,thou wilt go to hell; and thy designs being such, I will nothold parley with thee. Honest people should act carefullyin connection with the wicked.'—Thus reprimanded by him,his (Rāvana's) councillors, headed by Māricha, on beingstruck, took to their heels. Then Daçagriva on beingstruck in the head with the mace by the lord of Yakshas,did not move from his place. And then, O Rāma, the Yakshaand Rākshasa, smiting each other in mighty encounter,did not get bewildered or experience fatigue. And thenthe bestower of riches discharged a fiery weapon at him;and thereat the lord of Rākshasas resisted it with a Varunaweapon. And then the Rākshasa king entered uponRākshasi-illusion; and began to assume a thousandshapes for compassing the destruction (of his adversary).And the Ten-necked one (successively) assumed the shapesof a tiger, a boar, a cloud, a hill, the ocean, a tree, aYaksha and a Daitya. Thus he wore full many forms andhe was not visible in his native shape. And then, O Rāma,seizing a mighty weapon the Ten-necked one, whirlingthe same, brought that redoubtable mace down on the headof the bestower of riches. Thus smitten by him, thelord of wealth, baffled, toppled down to the earth coveredwith blood like an açoka whose roots have been hewnaway. Thereat Padma and other Nidhi deities,surrounding the granter of wealth, raised him up and broughthim to the Nandana wood. Conquering the bestower ofwealth, the lord of Rākshasas, with a delighted heart,possessed himself of his Pushpaka, the car, as a sign of victory;furnished with golden pillars, gateways set with lapises,covered with networks of pearls, having trees yieldingthe fruits of all seasons, endowed with the celerity of thought,ranging everywhere at will, wearing forms at pleasure,capable of coursing in the sky, with golden and jewelledstairs, and daises of polished gold,—the vehicle of thegods—undeteriorating, bringing delight to the mind and sight;wonderous exceedingly: painted with images designed tofill the mind with reverence,—constructed by Brahmā,containing all objects of desire, charming and nonparielnot cold and not yet hot, granting gratification in everyseason, and graceful to the view. And ascending that(car) coursing at will, won by his prowess, that utterlywicked one, out of swelling insolence, deemed himself masterof the three worlds. And having vanquished the deityVaiçravana, he descended from Kailāça. And having byhis energy obtained the victory, the powerful night-rangerwearing a bright diadem and necklace, and seated on thatsuperb car,—appeared radiant in his court like Fire himself.\""

And the Ten-neckedone saw the great golden wood of reeds. Furnished withnetworks of solar rays, and appearing like a second Sun,and ascending the mountain, he was surveying the heartof the forest, when, O Rāma, Pushpaka was (suddenly)deprived of its motion. And the lord of Rākshasas couldnot comprehend how the car which had been so made as tocourse in accordance with the wish of the rider, couldhave its course impeded; and thereat he in company withhis councillors thought, 'Wherefore doth not this Pushpakacourse at my desire over this mountain? Whose act isthis?' Thereat Māricha—foremost of intelligentones—said,—That Pushpaka doth not course cannot, sire, be withoutcause; or it may be that in consequence of Pushpakā nothaving borne any other than the bestower of riches, ithath ceased its course not having the lord of wealth for itsrider.' As they were speaking thus, that attendant ofBhava, Nandi, terrific, of yellow black hue, dwarfish,frightful, with his head shaven, having short arms, andstout,—coming up to them, said (this). And the lordly Nandi,undaunted, addressed the sovereign of the Rākshasas,saying: 'Desist thou O Ten-necked one; Sankara sportethin the mountain; and (now) He is incapable of beingapproached by every one—birds, serpents and Yakshas;gods, Gandharvas and Rakshas?' Hearing Nandi's speech,(Rāvana), wrought up with wrath, his eyes coppery, and hisear-rings shaking, leapt down from Pushpaka. And saying, 'Whois this Sankara?' he came down to the base of the mount, andbeheld there Nandi stationed at the side of that deity,supporting himself on his flaming dart, resembling a second Sankara.And seeing that one having the face of a monkey, the Rākshasa,deriding him, burst out into laughter, and seemed as if a massof clouds were sending roars. Thereat, growing enraged, thereverend Nandi—Sankara's other body—spoke unto thatRaksha—The Ten-necked one—present there; 'As O Daçanana,deriding me for my monkey-form, thou hast indulged in alaughter resembling the bursting of thunder, so monkeysendowed with prowess, and possessed of my form and energy shallbe born for compassing the destruction of thy race. Andarmed with teeth and claws, and fierce and furnished withthe fleetness of thought, and mad for encounter, and burstingwith vigor, and resembling moving mountains. And beingborn, they shall crush thy high pride and power alongwith thy courtiers and sons. But, O night-ranger, I caneven now end thee quite; yet I must not slay thee for thouhast ere this been slain by thine acts.' When thathigh-souled god had spoken thus celestial kettle-drums soundedand a blossomy shower rained from the sky. But withouthefting Nandi's speech, that highly powerfulone—Daçanana—coming to the mountain, said,—'O Gopati, I will evenuproot this mountain, for whom Pushpaka was deprived ofits motion as I was journeying. It must be known by whatinfluence Bhavaswara sporteth here king-like. He doth notknow that an occasion of fear hath presented itself?' Havingsaid this, O Rāma, Rāvana seizing the mountain with hisarms, lifted it up at once; and then the mountaintrembled greatly. And in consequence of the mountain shakingthe attendants of the deity (dwelling in it) also shook. AndPārvati also trembled and embraced Maheçwara. And then,O Rāma, Mahādeva—foremost of the deities—even Hara,as in sport pressed the mount with his great toe. And thereathis arms, resembling blocks of stone felt the shock andthen there the councillors of that Raksha were struck withamaze. And the Raksha, from wrath and the pain felt inhis arms, set up a shout that shook the entire triune world.And his councillors considered it as the concussion of thethunder at the universal disruption. And then the celestialswith Indra at their head shook on their way; and the seawas wild and the mountains shook. And Yakshas andVidyadharas and Siddhas asked, 'What is this.' 'Dothou propitiate Umā's lord—the blue-throated Mahādeva; for,O Daçanana, save him thy refuge see we none in this matter.Bowing thyself down, do thou seek him as thy shelter.Then the kind Sankara, on being gratified, will confer on theehis favor.' Thus accosted by his councillors, theTen-faced one, bowing down to him having the bull for hisstandard, began to hymn him with various soma hymns; andthe Raksha passed away a good thousand years inlamentations. And thereat that Lord Mahadeva, pleased,set free the hands of Daçanana stationed at the top of themount, and O Rāma, addressed him, saying, 'O Dacānana,pleased am I with thee on account of thy hymns. And asin consequence of thy arms having been hurt by the mountain,thou hast uttered a terrific yell, which struck horror untothe three worlds and put them shaking, therefore, O King,thy name shall be Rāvana. And deities and men and Yakshasand others living on earth shall call thee Rāvana—terror tocreatures. So, O Paulastya, which way thou wishest, andpermitted by me, O Lord of Rākshasas, go thou.' Thusaccosted by Sambhu, Lankā's lord said of himself. 'If thouart pleased with me, grant me a boon, who ask thee forit. I have already obtained a boon, bestowing on meimmunity from death at the hands of gods, Gandharvas andDānavas; and Rākshasas and Guyhakas and Nagas; andothers also that are of more than ordinary strength. Mancount I not O god: they, I deem, are insignificant. I havealso, O destroyer of Tripura, received a long lease of lifefrom Brahmā. Now I wish to pass the remainder of mydays in peace: and do thou grant me a weapon.' Thusaddressed by him, (Rāvana,) Sankara gave him an exceedinglyeffulgent sword, famed as Chandrahasa; and the master ofspectres then also granted him peace for the rest of his life.And making (the sword) over to him, Sambhu said,—'Thoumust not disregard this. If disregarded, it will for certaincome (back) to me?' Having thus received his name fromMaheçwara, Rāvana, saluting Mahadeva, ascendedPushpaka. And then, O Rāma, Rāvana, began to go roundthe earth. And opposed at places, by the heroic Kshatriyasendowed with energy and irrepressible in fight, who refusedsubmission, he exterminated them along with their retainers;while other men of wisdom, knowing the Raksha to beinvincible, said unto the Rākshasa elated with strength,—'We havebeen conquered?'\""

My father's intended son-in-lawwas even Vishnu—sovereign of the celestials, and the lordof the triune world; and my father would not bestow me onany other. And hearing this, a certain king of the Daityas,named Sumbhu—proud, of his prowess was wrought up withwrath, and one night as my sire was on bed, that wicked oneslew him. Thereat my forlorn mother, of exalted righteousness,embracing my father's body entered into fire. Thenwishing to realize my father's wish touching Nārāyana, I havefixed my heart even upon him. Having made this promise, Ihave been carrying on rigid austerities. Thus, O foremost ofRākshasas. I have related unto thee everything. Nārāyanais my husband, and not any one else than that best of malebeings; and desirous of having Nārāyana I have adoptedsevere restraints. I know thee, O king. Go thou O sonof Paulastya. By virtue of my asceticism I know all thattakes place in these three regions.' Thereat descending fromthe front of his car, Rāvana, afflicted with the shafts ofKandarpa, again addressed that girl, observant of a mighty vow,'O thou of shapely hips, in as much as such is thy intent,thou must be very proud. O thou having the eyes of ayoung antelope, accumulation of religious merit suits oldpeople. Thou, furnished with every perfection, should nottalk thus. Thou art the paragon in these three worlds. Thyyouth waxeth away. I am the lord of Lankā, O gentle lady,known as Daçagriva. Be thou my wife, and enjoy pleasuresaccording to thy desire. Who is he whom thou callest Vishnu?O mild one, neither in prowess, nor in asceticism, nor inenjoyment, nor in strength, is he my equal, whom, O damsel,thou seekest.' Thus accosted, Vedavati said unto thenight-ranger 'Do not say so' in respect of Vishnu, lordof this triune sphere, bowed down unto by all creatures.Save and except thee alone, who, that is intelligent, criethdown (Nārāyana), O King of Rākshasas.' Thus addressedthere by Vedavati, the night-ranger seized the girl by thehair. Thereat Vedavati, wroth, cut off her hair with herhand transformed into a sword. And then, flamingup in ire and as if consuming the night-ranger, she,preparing a funeral pyre, hastened to make away with herself.'Thou abject, having been outraged by thee I wish not tolive. Therefore, O Raksha, I will enter into fire in thy verypresence. And as I have in this world been dishonoredby thee thou art nefarious. I shall again be born tocompass thy destruction. It lieth not in a female to slaya male intent on sin; and if I utter a curse, it shall cost myasceticism. But if I have done anything, given away anything, offered oblations unto the fire, then I shall be thechaste daughter of some virtuous person, albeit unborn ofany female vessel.' Having delivered herself thus, sheentered into the flaming fire; and thereat a celestial showerof blossoms rained all around from heaven. O Lord, thisis she that hath been born as the daughter of kingJanaka,—thy wife, O mighty-armed one. Thou art the eternal Vishnu.The enemy, endowed with the splendour of a hill, formerlythat had been slain through the wrath (of Vedavati), hathnow been slain by her, by help of thine superhuman prowess.And this one of eminent righteousnesss would again springup on earth like a flame from a field furrowed by theplough. This one named Vedavati was born in the Krita age;and in the Tretā age, for compassing the destruction of thatRaksha, she was born in the Maithila line of the high-souledJanaka.\""

  "Uttara Kānda": "\"When Vedavati had entered into fire, Rāvana,ascending Pushpaka, began to range the earth. Andcoming to Uçiraviga, Rāvana saw a king (named)Marutta, sacrificing along with the deities. And arighteous Brahmarshi named Samvartta, the very brother ofVrihashpati, officiated at the sacrifice accompanied by thedeities. And seeing that Raksha invincible by reason ofthe boon he had received, the deities, apprehensive ofbeing worsted by him, assumed the forms of beasts. AndIndra became a peacock and the king of righteousness,a crow, and the bestower of riches a lizard, and Varunaa swan; and, O slayer of foes, others also became otherbeasts. And then Rāvana entered into that sacrificelike an unclean dog. And then coming up to the king,Rāvana—lord of Rākshasas—said: 'Give me battle, orsay,—I am defeated.' Whereat king Marutta asked,him—'Who art thou?' And Rāvana laughing incontempt said,—'O king, I am delighted, that lackingcuriosity, thou dost not dishonour Rāvana, younger brotherunto the bestower of riches. What other man is therein these three regions that knoweth not the might ofme, who, conquering my brother, has got possession ofthis car.' Thereat Marutta spoke unto Rāvana,saying,—'Blessed for sooth art thou, by whom thy elder brotherhath been vanquished in fight; and a person sopraiseworthy there is not in the three worlds. An act, that isdivorced from righteousness and that is reprehended bypeople, can never be praiseworthy. Having committeda foul act, plumest thou upon thy having vanquished thybrother? And practising what piety hadst thou a-fortunereceived the boon? I had never before heard the like ofwhat thou sayest. But O perverse one, stay now. Livingthou shalt not back. To-day with my sharpened shaftsshall I despatch thee to the abode of Yama.' Then takingup his bow and arrows, that king of men went out forencounter; but Samavartta stood in the way. And thatgreat sage said unto Marutta words informed with affection'If thou hear my speech, thou shouldst not fight. If thisMaheçwara-sacrifice should remain incomplete, it willburn up thy dynasty. Where is the fight of one initiatedin a sacrifice? And where is the passion of oneinitiated in a sacrifice? And victory is ever uncertain;and the Rākshasa is difficult to vanquish. Andthereupon, the lord of Earth—Marutta—desisted inconsonance with the instructions of his spiritual preceptor; andcomposed addressed himself to completing the sacrifice,giving up his bow with the arrow set. And thereatconsidering him as defeated, Suka proclaimed this all round; andfrom delight cried aloud, 'Victory unto Rāvana!' And thendevouring the Maharshis that were present at the place ofsacrifice, Rāvana, satiated with their blood, again went tothe earth. On Rāvana having departed, the deities, inhabitingthe etherial regions—Indra etc.—assuming their properforms, addressed those creatures. And from joy Indra spokeunto the purple-plumed peacock,—'Pleased am I with theethou righteous one. No fear shall spring to thee fromserpents; and thy plumage shall be furnished with an hundredeyes. And when I shall shower, thou shalt be filled with gleeas a token of my satisfaction with thee.' Thus didIndra—chief of celestials, confer a boon on the peacock. Formerly,O king, the peacock's wings had one unvaried blue. Havingreceived the boon, the peacock departed. Then O Rāma,the king of righteousness said unto the crow, seated in frontof the sacrificial apartment 'O bird, I am well pleased withthee. Listen to my words as I utter them. As I havebeen pleased with thee, thou shalt without doubt, enjoyimmunity from the various ailments to which the birdsare subject. And O bird, from my curse fear of deathshall not approach thee; and thou shalt exist so longas people do not slay thee. And those men residing in mydominion, being smitten with hunger, shall be refreshedalong with thy relations, when thou hast eaten andbeen refreshed.' Then Varuna addressed that lord of birdsthe swan ranging the waters of the Gangā,—'Listen to mywords fraught with joy, thy hue shall be charming, mild,and like unto the lunar disc; and it shall be beautiful,resembling the sheen of spotless foam. And approaching myperson thou shalt ever be beautiful to behold; and thoushalt, as a sign of my gratification, attain unparalleledcomplacence.' Formerly, O Rāma, swans had not a hueof one unvaried whiteness. Their wings ended in blue,and their breasts wore the spotless hue of tender grass. Andthen Vaiçravana addressed the chameleon as it was stationedat the mountain: 'Thy hue shall be gold-gleaming. Pleasedam I with thee. Thy undeteriorating head shall be evergold-hued. And this golden hue of thine shall proceed frommy gratification?' Having thus conferred boons on them atthat festal place, the celestials, along with the king, (onthe sacrifice) having ended, went to their abode.\""

  "Uttara Kānda": "\"Having vanquished Marutta, that lord ofRākshasas—the Ten-faced one—eager for encounter, began to range thecapitals of the foremost monarchs (of the earth). Andcoming to the most powerful crowned heads (in the world)resembling Mahendra and Varuna, the Rākshasa king said:'Give me battle; or declare—we have been defeated. ThisI am resolved upon. Otherewise there is no escape for you?'Thereat those wise kings, possessed of great strength, and everabiding by righteousness, being frightened (at Rāvana'sintimidation), took counsel of each other. And knowing thesuperior strength of the foe, they said,—'We have been defeated.'Dushkanta, O child, and Suratha, and Gādhi, and Gayaand king Pururavā—all these kings said: 'We have beendefeated.' And then Rāvana—sovereign of theRākshasas—presented himself before Ayodhyā, governed by Anaranya, likeAmarāvati ruled by Sakra. And coming to that foremost ofmen—king like unto Purandara himself in prowess, Rāvanasaid,—' Give me battle; or say I have been defeated. This ismy mandate.' The lord of Ayodhyā, on hearing the words ofthat wicked-minded one, Anaranya, enraged, addressed theRākshasa-chief, saying,—'O king of Rākshasas, I will givethee combat, stay thou. At once prepare for fight, and I alsoshall go and prepare myself.' And when he had heard everything(regarding Rāvana), the forces of that foremost of kingsthat had been intended for conquering (Rāvana), salliedforth ready for bringing about the destruction of theRaksha,—ten thousand elephants, a niyuta horse, and many thousandsof cars and infantry, O best of men; and, that hostconsisting of infantry and cars, marched for encounter,covering up the earth. And then, O thou proficient in fight,there took place a mighty and wonderful encounter betweenking Anaranya and that lord of Rākshasas. And that host ofthe king encountering the forces of Rāvana, were extinguishedlike unto clarified butter thrown into the (sacrificial) fire. Andhaving fought valorously for a long time, the remnant ofthe royal forces, suddenly coming in contact with the flamingRākshasa ranks, were destroyed like unto swarms of locustsentering into fire. And he saw the mighty army of thatpowerful monarch destroyed by the (adversary), like unto a hundredstreams absorbed by an approaching ocean. And then himselfdrawing his bow resembling the bow itself of Sakra, thatforemost of sovereigns, beside himself with wrath, approachedRāvana. And brought down by Anaranya, his (Rāvana's)councillors—Māricha, Suka, and Sārana with Prahasta,—tookto their heels like unto dear. And then that son of theIkshwāku race discharged eight hundred arrows at Rāvana'shead. And like unto showers pouring down on the top ofa mountain, his shafts did not inflict any wound (on Rāvana).And then the king, smitten on the head with a slap by theenraged king of Rākshasas, dropped down from his car.And the king, deprived of his senses, fell down on the earth,with his body trembling all over; as falls in a forest a sālascathed with heaven's fire. And thereat the Raksha,laughing, spoke unto that Ikshwāku, lord of the earth,—'Whatis this that thou hast gathered as the fruit of thy encounterwith me. O king, there is none in this triune sphere thatcan combat with me. Having hitherto been sunk in lunacythou hast not heard of my strength.' As he was speakingthus, the king, whose sounds were fast running out said:'What can I do in this matter. Verily time is incapable ofbeing controlled. I have been overcome by Time; thou artmerely an instrument. What can I do now, when I am goingto lose my life? I never turned away from fight; I havebeen slain fighting. But, O Rākshasa, I shall tell theesomething in consequence of the disgrace that the Ikshwākurace has met with (to-day). If I have practised charity, ifI have offered oblations into fire, if I have carried on piouspenances, if I have governed my people well, then be mywords verified! There shall spring in the line of thehigh-souled Ikshwāku, one named Rāma—son unto Daçaratha,who shall deprive thee of thy life.' As he uttered thisimprecation, the celestial kettle-drums sounded like theroaring of clouds; and blossoms showered down from the sky.And then that best of kings went to heaven; and when thatking had gone to the celestial regions, the Rākshasa (also)went away.\""

And thereupon salutinghim, the night-ranger Ten-necked one—enquired after hiswelfare as well as the occasion of his visit. And thatDevarshi—the exceedingly energetic Nārada of immeasurablesplendour, seated on the back of the cloud, addressedRāvana, who was stationed in Pushpaka, saying,—'O lordof Rākshasas, O placid one, O son of Viçravā, stay. I amwell pleased with thy prowess and fame. And even asVishnu had pleased me by destroying the Daityas, thou pleasedme by harassing the Gandharvas and serpents. I will tellthee something. If thou wouldst hear what I have to saythen, O child, listen heedfully as I unfold it. Why, my child,dost thou slay these;50 thou art incapable of being slain byeven the celestials. All these (men) are subject to death, theyare verily slain. The world of man is unworthy of beingafflicted by thee who art incapable of being destroyed byDeities, Dānavas, Daityas, Yakshas, Gandharvas andRakshas. Who should slay creatures, who are ever stupidin respect of their welfare, environed by mightydangers, and encompassed by decrepitude and hundreds o£ailments? What sensible person can set his heart onslaying human beings who are everywhere beset with aperrennial stream of evils. Do not thou enfeeble thosebeings who are already enfeebled and smitten by Divinitywith hunger, thirst, old age etc. and who are overwhelmedwith sorrow, and grief. O mighty-armed one, O lord ofRākshasas, behold man, albeit having their sense stupified,engaged in the pursuit of various interests, and themselvesnot understanding their own ways;51 some pass their timemerrily with dancing and playing on musicalinstruments while others weep distressfully with tears streamingfrom their eyes down their cheeks. And down fallen onaccount of their attachment for their mothers and fathers andsons, and of their desires touching their wives and friendsthey set small store by labours having the hereafter as theirobject. What then is the use of afflicting a race that isbrought down ever by its own infatuation. O placid one,this world is verily conquered by thee. These for certainwill have to repair to the abode of Yama. Therefore, OPaulastya, O captor of hostile capitals, do thou put downYama. On him being conquered, all will doubtless beconquered by thee.' Thus addressed Lankā's lord, flaming innative energy, addressed Nārada, laughing and saluting him,'O thou that delightest in the sport of gods and Gandharvas,and that takest pleasure in warfare, I am ready to go to thenethermost regions for the purpose of conquest. Andconquering the three worlds, and bringing under subjectionserpents and celestials I shall for ambrosia churn the netherregions.' Then the reverend sage Nārada spoke Unto theTen-necked one,—'Who save thee can forsooth go on thatjourney? Verily, O irrepressible one, O destroyer of foes,the way leading to the city of the lord of the deadis difficult of access.' Thereat laughing, the Ten-facedone said to the saint resembling a mass of white clouds,'This is done. Therefore,52 O great Brahman, intent uponslaying the Vaivaçwata's son, I will go by this way whichleadeth to the king—the offspring of the sun. And, Omaster, from wrath I have vowed that I will, eager forencounter, O reverend one, conquer the four Lokapālas. Thenhere go I to the city of the lord of the Pitris; and I amdetermined to compass the death of him that visiteth creatureswith smart.' Having delivered himself thus and saluted thesage, he, entering the southern way with his councillors,proceeded along. And the exceedingly energeticNārada—best of Brahmans—resembling a smokeless fire, remaining raptfor a while, began to reflect;—'How can (Rāvana) conquerTime who, when its life waneth, righteously visiteth withaffliction the time, sphere with Indra, fraught with mobileand immobile. How can this lord of Rākshasas, of himself,go to him who, resembling another fire, beareth to thegifts and acts (of persons),—that high-souled one of whomattaining consciousness, people put forth their activity; andafflicted with the fear of whom these three worlds fall away?How can (Rāvana) subdue him who ordaineth things bothgreat and small, who meteth rewards and punishments forgood and bad acts, and who himself hath conquered the threeworlds? Resorting53 to what other means shall Rāvana secure(victory)? I am curious about it: To Yama's abode shall Igo for witnessing the encounter between Yama and theRākshasa.\""

And doth virtue deteriorate.'55 And,why, O thou honored of deities, and Gandharvas, dost thoucome?' Thereat the reverend sage, Nārada, said; Hearken.I shall tell (thee); and (after hearing me out) do thouwhat is fit. O king of the Pitris, here cometh thenight-ranger named ten-necked, for bringing thee under hissway—thee who art incapable of being conquered. And,O master, for this reason it is that I have come hitherhastily,—doubtful what shall befall thee who hast the rodfor thy weapon. In the meanwhile they saw the Raksha'scar approach from afar, flaming and like unto theray-furnished (one) risen. And dispelling the gloom of thatregion with the effulgence of Pushpaka, that exceedinglypowerful (Rākshasa) came forward. And the mighty-armedten-necked one all around saw creatures reaping theconsequences of their fair and foul acts. And there he saw Yama'ssoldiery along with Yama's followers, fierce-forms, grim-visagedand terrific. And he saw corporeal beings undergoingtorments and pain, and emitting loud cries and sharp shrieks;preyed on by worms and fell dogs: and uttering wordscapable of striking pain and terror into the heart (of thehearer): and people swimming in the Vaitaraini profuselyrunning blood; and momentarily burning with hot sands;unrighteous wights pierced in a wood of asipatra, (plunged)in Raurava, in the river of borate of soda; and (cut) withrazor-edges; asking for drinks; and afflicted with hungerand thirst; converted into corpses, lean, woe-begone, andpallid with hair flowing loosely; having dust and filth (on theirbodies), and running about distressfully with dry forms;—onthe way saw Rāvana by hundreds and by thousands. AndRāvana also saw some in front of houses engaged inmerry-making with songs and strains of instruments,—as the fruitof their pious acts; and (saw) the giver of kine regailingthemselves with milk; the dispenser of rice, feeding on thesame, the bestower of abodes, enjoying mansions, as thefruit of their several acts; and persons living withdamsels decked with gold and gems and jewels; and otherpious folks, flaming in their native energy, all these sawRāvana lord of Rākshasas. And by his might that mightyone delivered those that were being tormented by theirwicked acts. And on being liberated by that Raksha—theten-necked one, those creatures in a moment began to enjoytheir release, that had come to them without thought orsuspense. And on the dead being delivered by themagnanimous Rākshasa, the guards of the dead, getting enraged,rushed at the Rākshasa sovereign. And there arose a mightytumult from all sides; from the heroic warriors of the king ofrighteousness rushing (all around.) And those heroes byhundreds and by thousands assailed (Pushpaka) with prāças,and bludgeons, and darts and maces, and spears and tomaras.And swiftly swarming like bees, they began to break theseats, blocks, daises and gateways (of the car.) And in thatconflict Pushpaka presided over by divine energy, incapableof being destroyed by virtue of Brahmā power, being broken,resumed its former shape. Countless were the soldiers ofthat high-souled one consisting hundreds and thousands ofheroic warriors, (ever) forward for fight. And accordingto the measure of their might his (Rāvana's)councillors—great heroes all, as well as the ten-faced one himself withmight and main, fought with trees and crags and hundredsof blocks of buildings. And those councillors of the lordof Rākshasas, assailed with every kind of weapons, withtheir persons bathed in blood, fought fiercely. And Olarge-armed one the exalted councillors of Yama and Rāvana soreassailed each other with arms. And leaving the councillorsalone the highly powerful warriors of Yama rushed againstDaçānana56 with a shower of spears. And then pierced throughand through by those weapons, with his person covered withblood, the Rākshasa king appeared like a flowering Kinçukain Pushpaka.57 And thereat that powerful one, by virtue ofhis mastery over weapons, began to hurl darts and maces,prāças and spears and tomaras and crags and trees. Andthat terrific shower of trees, rocks and arms, alighted onthe army of Yama (fighting) on the earth. And snappingthose weapons and resisting (those vollies of) arms, theysmote at the Rākshasa fighting alone by hundreds andthousands. And encompassing him even as clouds encompass amountain, they rendered (Rāvana) inert by means ofBhindipālas and darts. And with his mail torn open, hisanger raging fiercely, and covered with blood streaming overhis person, he, forsaking his car, stood upon the ground.And then furnished with his bow and holding his shafts,(Rāvana) regaining his senses in a short time, increased inenergy and stood in the field like the finisher. And nowfixing the divine Pāçupata on his bow, and saying untothem, 'Slay! Slay!' he drew that bow. And enraged, (Rāvana)resembling Rudra himself, in fight drawing his bow to hiscar, discharged that shaft even as Sankara had discharged atTripura. And the appearance of the shaft was like anextinguishing fire in summer with smoke with flames,burning up a forest. And garlanded with glory that shaftfollowed by ghosts,58 in that encounter; rushed on, burning toashes the loose bushes and trees lying in its way. And burntup by its energy, the most of Vaivaswata fell down in thefield like unto banners of Mahendra.

And knowing that his forces hadbeen slain, he, with his eyes crimsoned with passion hastilyspoke unto his charioteer, 'Bring thou my car.' Andthereat the charioteer brought the noble and mighty car and stood(there) and then that exceeding energetic one mounted thecar. And in front (of his car) stood death, equipped withpraças and maces in his hands, who makes nothingof this entire triune world; incapable of deterioration. Andbeside (him) was the rod of Time in its native from—the divineinstrument of Yama like unto a flaming fire on account ofits own energy. And then on beholding Time, infuriated,tending to strike terror into all creatures, was agitated thetriune universe, and trembling over took the denizens ofheaven. And the charioteer urged on the steedspossessed of graceful splendour; and arrived where the lord ofRākshasas was posted. And in a moment those horseslike unto thought (in celerity,) and resembling the steedsthemselves of Hari, took Yama where the warfare had alreadybegun. And seeing the frightful car in that aspect withDeath present in it, the ministers of the Rākshasa monarchat once took to their heels. And in consequence of theirbeing comparatively inferior in point of strength they weredeprived of their senses, and afflicted with fear; and saying,'Here we are not equal to fighting' they went their way.But seeing that car capable of striking terror into folks, theTen-necked did not experience any agitation, nor did fearenter his heart. And approaching Rāvana, Yama, enraged,discharged spears and tomaras, and began to pierce Rāvana'smarrow. But Rāvana, without at all feeling any smart,began to shower arrows on Vaivaswata's vehicle, resemblinga downpour caused by clouds. And again at his spaciousbreast, that Rākshasa who had undergone slender injury,could not resist, (Yama's arms) with hundreds of mightydarts hurled. And in this way that destroyer of foes—Yamafought for seven nights with various arms; until at lengthhis enemy was driven back and deprived of his senses. Andthen, O hero, there took place mighty onset between Yamaand the Rākshasa both eager for victory and both nevertiring of fight. And celestials and Gandharvas andSiddhas, and the supreme saints, placing Prajapati at theirhead, presented themselves at the fight. And theencounter that then took place between that foremost ofof Rākshasas and the lord of the Dead was like theuniversal upheaval. And stretching his bow resembling inspleandour the thunderbolt of Indra, he discharged arrows coveringup the sky. And he smote Death with four, the (Yama's)charioteer with seven, and swiftly struck Yama in the marrowwith hundreds and thousands of shafts. And then fromforth Yama's mouth there issued darted flames with his teethmixed with smoke, the fire of his fury. And witnessingthis wonder in the presence of the deities and Dānavas,both Death and Time were fired with wrath and werefilled with delight. And the Death, growing still morewroth, addressed Vaivaswata saying;—'Let me go. I shallslay this sinful Rākshasa. Even this is my native mightthis Rākshasa will be no more. Hiranyakaçipu, thegraceful Nemuchi, and Shamvara, Nishandi and Dhumaketuand Virochana's offspring Vāli, and the Daitya Shamvuthat mighty monarchs, Vritra and Bāna; and Kājarshisversed in all branches of learnings and Grandharvas, andmighty serpents, and sages, and Pannagas and Yakshas,and swarms of Apsarās and the Earth herself containingvasty oceans and mountains and rivers and trees, at theunrolling of a Yuga—all these, O mighty monarchhave I brought to dissolution. All these and many moreendowed with strength and incapable of being overcome,were at the very sight of me compassed withperil,—and what is this ranger of the night? Let me go. O thoucognizant of righteousness,—I shall slay this one. There isnone that, albeit strong, can survive after having been seenby me. Verily this is not mine strength,—this mightpertaineth to me by nature. O Time, if seen by me, he won'tlive for a moment.' Hearing these words of his, the puissantking of righteousness spake there unto death,—'Do thou stay.I myself shall slay him.' Then with his eyes reddened thatlord, Vaivaswata, wielded with his hand the infallibledart of time; while by him lay the redoubtable noose oftime and the mace in its native shape resembling fire and thethunderbolt. He, who by his very sight draweth away thelives of creatures,—what should be said of its touching andbeing hurled at people? And touched by that powerful one,that mighty weapon, engist with flames, attained access ofenergy, and seemed to consume the Rākshasa. And in thefield of battle, every one afflicted with fear, ran away fromit. And beholding Yama with his rod uplifted, the celestialswere agitated. And on Yama being desirous of slayingRāvana, the great-father manifesting himself spake untoYama: 'O Vaivaswata, O mighty-armed one, O thou ofimmeasurable prowess, this certainly must not be; Thoushouldst not with thy rod slay the night-ranger; for, Oforemost of celestials, I have conferred a boon on him;and thou shouldst not render false the words that I haveuttered. Verily he, that, whether a god or a human being,shall falsify my words, shall render this triune universefalse. There is no doubt about this. If this terrific weapon,capable of affrighting the three spheres, be discharged alikeat friends and foes, it will destroy creatures. This rod of time,of immeasurable might and incapable of being resisted bycreatures, was created by me as having the power ofcompassing the death of all beings. Therefore, O mild one,thou forsooth shouldst not bring it down on Rāvana's head. Ifthis alights on any one, he doth not live for a moment,Whether on this weapon allighting, the ten-necked does notdie, or if he does do either way falsehood is the consequence,therefore do thou keep thy uplifted weapon off Lankā'slord. If thou have any care for these worlds do thouestablish my truth.' Thus addressed, Yama then answered,'I restrain this rod. Thou art our Lord. But asI can not slay this one who hath obtained a boon, whatthen shall I do now in the field? Therefore shall I disappearfrom the sight of this Raksha.' Having said this, eventhere did he vanish with his car and horses. And havingvanquished him and distinguished his name, he again ascendedhis Pushpaka and went out of the abode of Yama. Andwith a delighted heart Vaivaswata along with the deitiesheaded by Brahmā—as well as that mighty ascetic-Nārada,went to the celestial regions.\""

  "Uttara Kānda": "\"Having vanquished Yama, the foremost of celestials,Rāvana delighting in warfare, saw his adherents. And seeingRāvana, with his person bathed in blood, bettered by theweapon discharged at him, they were seized with surprise.And hailing him with victory, the councillors headed byMāricha, having been encouraged by Rāvana, ascendedPushpaka. And then the Raksha entered the regionof waters—the abode of Daityas and serpents, well protectedby Varuna. And arriving at Bhogavati—the city governedby Vāsuki, he brought the serpents under subjection andthen, delighted, bent his course to the palace—Manimayi.There dwelt the Nivatakavachas, who had obtained boons.Those Daityas were possessed of prowess and endowed withstrength,—carrying various weapons, breathing high spirits andinvincible in battle. And the Dānavas and Rākshasasgrowing enraged fell to raving each other with darts andtridents, Kuliças and axes and pattiças. And as they foughtone entire year passed away and neither side obtainedvictory or was worsted. And then that way of the triunesphere, that God, the undeteriorating Great-father, swiftlypresented himself on the scene mounted on his excellentcar. And making the Nivatakavachas desist from battlethe ancient great-father spake in clear words—'Eventhe celestials and the Asuras are not able tovanquish this Rāvana in battle; nor can the Dānavasbacked by the gods can destroy you. Do you thereforeturn your minds to making friends with the Rākshasa.All interests are forsooth the common possession of friends.'Thereat Rāvana made friends with the Nivatakavachasin the presence of Fire; and then rejoiced greatly. And dulyhonored (by them) Daçānana passed there a year, withoutany feeling of that place being different from his own home:and spent his time agreeably. And having learnt therean hundred sorts of illusion, he directed his course toRasatala, searching for the city of the lord of waters. And thengoing to the city named Açma ruled by the Kalakayas,(Rāvana) slew the Kalakayas endowed with terrificstrength; and then with his sword cut off his brother-in-law,59the husband of Surpanakhā, the mighty Vidyutjibhapossessed of terrific strength; as that Rākshasa in the encounter waslicking (the limbs of Rāvana's followers).60 Having vanquishedhim, he, in a moment, destroyed four hundred Daityas. Andthen the lord of Rākshasas saw the grand abode of Varunaresembling a mass of white clouds, and effulgent likeunto Kailāça itself;—and also saw the milk-conservingSurabhi stationed there; from the streams of whose milkwas produced the ocean named Kshiroda.61 And thereRāvana saw the mother of kine and the foremost of bulls;from whom springeth that maker of night themild-beaming-moon; taking refuge under whom subsist the primesaints and those living on froth, the froth62 (of milk); andwherefrom sprang ambrosia as well as the Swadha ofSwādhā-subsisting ones,63 even her that goeth with human beingsunder the name of Surabhi. Having gone round thiswonderful (cow), Rāvana entered the exceedingly dreadfulabode of Varuna guarded by various kinds of forces. Andthen he beheld Varuna's splendid mansion, streaming withhundreds of torrents, resembling a mass of autumnal clouds,and always wearing a delightful aspect. And killing thegenerals of the forces, after having been resisted by them,he addressed the warriors, saying,—'Do you speedily acquaintyour king with this. Rāvana hath come here seekingbattle. Do thou give him fight, or say with joinedhands, \"I have been defeated by thee,\" and then thouhast no fear whatever.' In the meantime the sons andgrandsons of the high-souled Varuna, as well as those ofPushkara issued forth. And they, endowed with everyvirtue, accompanied by their own forces, yoked carsfurnished with the effulgence of the rising Sun, and coursingat the desire of their riders. And then there took place amighty encounter capable of making people's down standon end, between the sons of the lord of waters, and thoseof the intelligent Rāvana. And in a short while that entirehost of Varuna was brought down by the highly powerfulcouncillor of that Rākshasa Daçagriva. And seeing theirown forces brought to straits in the conflict and drivenback in the fight with networks of shafts, and downon the ground and seeing Rāvana in Pushpaka, Varuna'ssons swiftly shot into the welkin with their fleet-footing cars.And after they had attained a station of equal vantage(with Rāvana) in the sky,64 great was the encounter that thentook place in the sky, resembling the encounter of thedeities and the Dānavas. And turning away Rāvana inthe conflict by means of shafts resembling fire, they,exceedingly rejoiced, emitted various shouts. And thenMahodara, enraged on seeing the king sore pressed, castingoff fear, and wrought up with rage, began to go around,eager for fight. And smit with his mace by Mahodara,Varuna's sons coursing at will and resembling the wind (invelocity), dropped down to the ground. And having slainthose warriors and also those horses of Varuna's sons(Mahodara) seeing them lying down deprived of their carsswiftly sent up a tremendous cheer. And destroyed byMahodara, their cars and horses together with theirforemost charioteers, lay low on the earth. And thenforsaking their cars, the sons of the high-souled Varuna, stationedin the sky, did not experience any pain65 by virtue of theirnative power. And having stretched their bows they piercedMahodara, and then, all together they greatly angeredprevented Rāvana. As the clouds, with a thousand torrentscleave a mountain, so they, with dreadful shafts, resemblingthunderbolts and discharged off the bows, pierced him.Thereupon the Ten-necked (demon), excited with wrath likethe fire of dessolution, pierced them to their very vitalswith highly dreadful arrows. And stationed above, heshowered on them variegated maces, Vallās,66 Pātticas, saktisand huge Sataghnis."

Beholding Varuna's sons thus worn out andoverwhelmed the highly powerful Rāvana roared in delightlike unto clouds. Thereupon emitting loud cries theRākshaha, like unto a cloud, with a downpour of diverseshafts, destroyed the offspring of Varuna. Thereupon theywere all defeated and fell dead on the ground and all theirfollowers fled away from the field of battle to their homes.Rāvana spoke unto them.—'Do ye communicate this toVaruna.' Whereto his minister Prahasta replied untoRāvana saying—'O great king—Varuna's sons are slainand the lord of waters, whom thou art inviting for battle,hath gone to the region of Brahmā, to hear songs. Whilethe king is away, what is the use of taking trouble, O hero?And all these heroic sons (of Varuna) have been vanquished.'Hearing these words and spreading his own name the lordof Rākshasas expressing sign of joy, issued out ofVaruna's abode. And returning by the way by which he hadcome, the Raksha, stationed in the welkin, proceeded towardsLankā.\""

  "Uttara Kānda": "\"And again journeyed in the city of Açma (the followers ofRāvana) dreadful in fight. There the Ten-necked demon behelda highly picturesque house—adorned with networks of pearls,having gateways crested with Vaidurjas, golden pillars andabounding in pavements. And the stairs, of that picturesquehouse resembling the abode of Mahendra, covered withgirdles, were made of crystal. Beholding that excellent boostthe highly powerful Rāvana thought within himself—'Whoseis this beautiful house, resembling the summit of Meru? GoO Prahasta, and learn quickly whose house is this.' Thusordered, Prahasta entered that excellent house—and findingnone in one appartment he entered another and thus enteringseven apartments he at last saw a flame of fire. There wasa man in that flame, who, when seen, laughed aloud. Hearingthat dreadful laughter Prahasta's down stood on their end.There was another man in that flame, as if in a swoon,engarlanded with golden lotuses, incapable of being lookedat, like the sun, and resembling the Yama's self. Beholdingthat the night-ranger speedily issued out of the house andcommunicated it unto Rāvana. Thereupon, O Rāma, havingdescended from Pushpaka, the Ten-necked demon, black ascollyrium, entered that house. (Immediately) obstructing thedoor there stood a huge-bodied man, dreadful like Siva—histongue was all flame, his eyes were red, rows of teethbeautiful, lips like Bimba, his form was handsome, nosedreadful, neck like a shell marked with three lines, jawswere spacious, beards thick, bone fleshy, teeth huge and hisappearance was all dreadful. And taking up an iron macehe stood at the gate. Beholding him, Daçānana's hairsstood on their end—his heart and body trembled. Andseeing these bad omens, O Rāma, he began to think withinhimself. He thus meditating that man said—'What artthou thinking, O Rākshasa? Tell me all in confidence. Ishall confer upon thee the hospitality of fighting, O hero,O night-ranger.' Having said this he again spoke untoRāvana, saying—'Dost thou wish to enter into conflict withBali, or what else is thy intention?' Rāvana was sooverwhelmed that his hairs stood on their end; but resorting tocalmness he said—'O thou foremost of those skilled inspeech, who residest in this house? I shall fight with him;speak out what thou wishest.' He again said (toRāvana)—'The lord of Dānavas lives here—he is highly generous,heroic, and hath truth for his prowess. He is gifted withmany qualities, resplendent like unto Yama with macein his hand or the newly risen sun and incapableof being defeated in conflict, impetuous, invincible, victorious,powerful, a veritable ocean of accomplishments,sweet-speeched, supporter of the dependants, fond of preceptor andBrahmans, always waiting for opportune hours, gifted withhigh powers, truthful, of a handsome person, skilful, giftedwith all accomplishments, heroic and engaged in the studyof the Vedas. He sometimes walks on foot and moves aboutlike the wind—he shines like fire and spreads heat like thesun. He travels with the gods, spirits, serpents and birds. Hedoes not know fear; dost thou wish to fight with him? If thoudost wish to fight with Bali, O lord of Rākshasas, O thou giftedwith great energy, do thou speedily enter (this house) andengage in the encounter.' Being thus addressed theTen-necked demon entered where Bali was. Beholding the lordof Lankā, the foremost of Dānavas, resembling the flamingfire, and hard to look at like the sun, laughed. And takingthat Rākshasa by the hand and placing him on his lap hesaid. 'O Ten-necked lord of Rākshasas, O thou havinglong arms, what desire of thine may I satisfy? Do thou tellme what for thou hast come hither.' Being thus addressed byBali Rāvana said—'I have heard, O illustrious sir, thatformerly thou wast bound by Vishnu. Forsooth I amcapable of releasing thee from the bonds.' Hearing that Balilaughed and said—'Hear, I shall relate to thee what thouhast asked, O Rāvana. The red-hued man, who stands alwaysat the door—by him formerly all the leading Dānavas andother powerful lords were brought into subjection—by himI was also bound. He is invincible like unto death; who isthere on this earth that can deceive him? He, who standsat the door, is the destroyer of all beings, creator andpreserver and the lord of the three worlds. Thou dost not knowhim nor do I. He is identical with past, future and presentand is the lord. He is Kali and he is Time—the destroyerof all beings. He is the destroyer and the creator of thethree worlds—and he slays all beings mobile and immobile.And that lord of all gods again creates the universe withoutbeginning or end. O night-ranger, he governs and preservesall sacrifices, gifts and oblations to fire. Forsooth he is thecreator and the preserver of the universe—there is none sowonderful in the three worlds. O son of Pulasta, He hathbeen guiding the former Dānavas, myself, yourself like somany beasts bound with ropes. Vitra, Danu, Suka, Sambhu,Nishumbha, Sumbha, Kālanemi, Prahlada and others, Kuta,Vairochana, Mridu, Jamala, Arjuna, Kansa, Kaitabha, andMadhu used to impart heat like the sun, appear resplendantlike the rays, move about like air and pour showers likeIndra. All of them celebrated many a sacrifice and wereengaged in austere penances. All of them were high-souledand considered the practice of Yoga as a great virtue.Having got by an immense accession of wealth they enjoyedmany pleasures, made many gifts, celebrated many sacrifices,studied (many lores) and governed their subjects. They wereall protectors of their own kith and kin and slayers ofenemies; and in battle, there was none equal to them in thethree worlds. They were all heroic, of a high pedigree, versedin all sacred writings, proficient in all branches of learning andindomitable in warfare. Having defeated thousands ofcelestials in conflict, the high-souled ones conquered theregions. They were always engaged in those works whichwere not liked by the celestials and used to maintain theirown men. They were all inflated with pride and haughtinessand effulgent like the newly-risen sun. The glorious Hari,the lord Vishnu, knoweth only how to bring about theirdestruction who perpetually assail the celestials. He createsall these and He, bringing about their destruction,existeth in Himself at the time of dissolution. Thesehighly powerful and high-souled Danava chiefs,assuming shapes at will, have been destroyed by the glorious God.Besides, all these heroes, who have been heard of as beingirrepressible and invincible in warfare, have beendiscomfitted by the wondrous power of Kritānta.' Havingsaid this the lord of Dānavas again spoke unto the lord ofRākshsas—'O hero, O thou gifted with great strength, takethat flaming discus which thou beholdest and come to myside. I shall then relate to thee the means of eternalliberation. Do what I have told thee, O thou having longarms. Delay not Rāvana.' Hearing this the highlypowerful Raksha proceeded, laughing, O descendant of Raghu,where that celestial kundala was. Rāvana, proud of his prowess,easily took it up but could not move it by any means. Andbeing ashamed that highly powerful one again attempted.As soon as it was uplifted the Rākshasa dropped down onground, bathed in a pool of blood, like unto an uprootedSāla tree. In the meantime there arose a sound fromPushpaka, and the councillors of that lord of Rākshasas criedaloud. Regaining his sense that Raksha rose up in a momentand lowered his head in shame. Bali said to him—'Do thoucome, O foremost of Rākshasas and hear my words. O hero,the kundala, crested with jewels, which thou didst assay to takeup, is an ornament for the ear of one of my forefathers.This fell here on the ground, O thou gifted with greatstrength; another kundala was thrown on the summitof the mountain. Besides these kundalas his crownwas also cast off on the ground before the altar during theencounter. Formerly none bore enmity towards my ancestorHiranya Kasipu—Time death, or illness. He had no deathduring the day, night, evening or morning. O foremostof Rākshasas, he did not experience death from anyweapon whatsoever. He created a dreadful enmitywith Prahlada. This conflict having taken place with thehigh-souled and heroic Prahlada there rose up a dreadful figureof man-lion—a terror unto all, O foremost of Rākshasas.And that terrible figure casting his looks about, all the worldswere over-whelmed."

Theperson, who is standing at the door, hath brought intosubjection, in thousands of years, a thousand of Indras, anAyuta of gods and hundreds of great Rishis.' Hearingthese words Rāvana said—'(I have seen) Kritānta, the lordof spirits with Death himself, with hairs standing erect.Serpents and scorpions are his hairs—his tongue is hard asthe lightning, his teeth are dreadful—his eyes are red andhe is gifted with great velocity and a terror unto all beings.He is incapable of being looked at like unto the sun,unconquerable in battle and is the chastiser of the sinners.

And setting the Raudra shaftupon his bow Rāvana discharged it and Māndhāta baffled itby means of his fiery shafts. The Ten-necked demon tookup the Gandharva weapon and the king Māndhāta theBrahmā-weapon striking terror unto all. Rāvana then took up thecelestial Pāsupata weapon, dreadful and increasing the frightof the three worlds, obtained by him from Rudra by virtue ofhis rigid penances. Seeing this all animals, mobile andimmobile, were stricken with terror. Thereupon trembledall the three worlds consisting of mobile and immobilebeings—the celestials and all the serpents became inert. Beingapprised (of this conflict) by virtue of meditation the twoforemost of ascetics Pulastya and Gālava remonstrated withthem in many a way and prevented the king (Māndhāta) andthe foremost of Rākshasas.

He, thenproceeded to the third excellent aerial region whereperpetually reside the high-minded Siddhas and Charanas and theextent whereof is also ten thousand leagues. O slayer ofenemies, he then speedily proceeded to the fourth aerialregion where perpetually dwelt the goblins and Vinayakas,He quickly went to the fifth aerial region which also extendsover ten thousand yojanas where exist Ganga, the foremost ofrivers, and the elephants headed by Kumuda, who pour downwaters. They sport in the waters of the Ganges and pourdown her holy waters. And those waters, parched by therays of the sun and softened by the wind, pour down holywaters and dews, O Rāghava, Thereupon that Rākshasawent to the sixth aerial region, O thou gifted with highradiance, which also extends over ten thousand yojanas andwhere dwells Garuda perpetually respected of his kinsmenand friends. He then went to the seventh aerial region whichis ten thousand leagues above and where dwell the sevenRishis. And again going up ten thousand leagues he reachedthe eighth aerial region where Ganga, known as the Gangesof the sky, having strong currents and sending high roars,and upheld by air, is situated on the sun's way. I shall nowdescribe the region higher than that where resides the moon,and the extent whereof is counted by eighty thousand leagues.There dwells the moon encircled by stars and planets fromwhom proceed hundreds and thousands of rays which light upthe worlds and conduce to the pleasure of all animals.Thereupon beholding the Ten-necked demon the moon as ifburnt (him) down speedily with his cold fiery rays. Andstricken with the fear of those rays his councillors could notstand them. Thereupon exclaiming his victory Prahasta saidto Rāvana—'O king, we are destroyed by cold, so we mustgo away from here. The Rākshasas have been terrified bythe rays of the moon; O foremost of kings, the cold rays ofthe moon have the natural property of fire in them.'Hearing the words of Prahasta, Rāvana, beside himself with wrath,having uplifted his bow and twanged it, began to assail him withNarachas. Thereupon Brahmā came speedily to the regionof the moon and said—'O Ten-necked one, O thou havingmighty arms, O direct son of Visravas, O gentle one, do thourepair hence speedily—do not oppress the moon—(for)this highly effulgent king of twice-born ones wishethwell-being unto all. I shall communicate to thee a mysticalincantation; He who recollects it at the time of death, doesnot come by it.' Being thus addressed the ten-neckeddemon, with folded hands, said—'If thou art pleased with meO god! O lord of the worlds, O thou of great penances, ifdost thou wish to communicate that incantation, do thouimpart it upon me, O thou of great piety; reciting which, Ogreat one, I may be released of the fear of the celestials.Forsooth, by thy favour, O lord of the celestials, I shallbe invincible by all the Asuras, Dānavas and birds.' Beingthus accosted Brahmā said to the ten-necked demon—'Olord of Rākshasas, do thou recite it at the time of death andnot every day. Taking a string of beads, thou shouldst recitethis holy incantation, on which, thou, O lord of Rashasas,shalt be invincible, And if dost thou not recite it thou shaltnot meet with success.

  "Uttara Kānda": "\"Having conferred this boon upon Rāvana thefather, sprung from lotus, speedily returned to the region ofBrahman. And having obtained the boon Rāvana too cameback. After a few days that Rākshasa Rāvana, the dread ofall people, arrived at the banks of the western Ocean withhis councillors. And on the island a person was seen bright asfire under the name of Mahajambunada, seated there alone.He had a dreadful figure and was like unto the fire atdissolution. And beholding that highly powerful personamongst men like unto the chief of gods amongst the celestials,the moon amongst the planets, the lion amongst the Sarabhas,80the Airavata amongst the elephants, the Meru amongst themountains, and the Pārijāta amongst the trees, the ten-neckeddemon said—'Give me battle.' Thereat his eyes becameagitated like unto planets and from the clashing of his teeththere arose a sound like the clapping of thunder-bolts. Andthe highly powerful Dasānana too roared with his councillors.And with darts, Saktis, Rishtis and Patticas he again andagain assailed that highly effulgent person, having long arms,a dreadful appearance, huge teeth, a grim figure, a conch-likeneck, spacious breast, a belly like that of a frog, a countenancelike that of a lion, legs like the mount Kailāsa, red palms,red hands, emitting dreadful roars, huge-bodied, gifted withthe velocity of mind and air, dreadful, carrying quiver, bellsand chowries, encircled by a burning flame and emitting asweet note as a net-work of Kinkini does, having a garlandof golden lotuses hung round his neck, appearing gracefullike unto the Rig-Veda, be-decked with lotus garlands,resembling the Anjana and golden mountains. As thelion is not moved by the attack of a wolf, the elephant bythat of a bull, the Sumeru by the king of serpents and thegreat Ocean by the current of a river, so that great person wasnot agitated and said to the ten-necked demon—'Ovicious-minded night-ranger, I shall soon remove they desire for abattle.' O Rāma, the might of that person was a thousandtimes greater than that of Rāvana which was dreadful untoall the worlds. Piety and asceticism, which are at the rootof attaining to every thing in the world, are at his thighs;Cupid is his male organ, the Viswadevas are at his waistand the Maruts are at the sides of his Basti; the Vasus are inthe middle portion of his body, the oceans are in his belly, thequarters are on his sides, the Maruts are at his joints—themanes are one his back and the grand-father has taken shelterin his heart; the pious acts of making gifts of kine, gold andlands are his downs; the mounts Himalaya, Hemkuta,Mandara, and Meru are his bones; the thunder-bolt is hispalm, the sky his body; the evening and watery cloudsare on his neck, the creator, the preserver and theVidyadharas are on his two arms. Ananta, Vasuki, VisalakshaIravat, Kamvala, Aswatara, Karkotaka, Dhananjaya thevenomous Takshaka, and Upatakshaka, have taken shelterunder the nails of his hands, in order to vomit forth theirvenom. The fire is in his mouth, the Rudras are on hisshoulders, the fortnights, months, years and seasons are onthe rows of his teeth; the lunar half and the dark half of themonth are in his nostrils—and the airy currents are inpores of his body. Saraswati, the goddess of words, is hisneck, the two Aswins are his ears, the sun and the moon arehis two eyes, O Rāma, all the divisions of the Vedas,Yagmas, the whole host of stars, good words, energy,asceticism—all these are being supported by his body, assumingthe shape of a man. Thereupon that Purusha easily struckRāvana with his hands hard as thunder. Being assailedthereby Rāvana immediately fell on the ground. Beholdingthat Rākshasa fallen and having distressed others that hugeperson, like unto the Rig-Veda, resembling a mountain andbe-decked with lotus garlands, entered the region under theearth. Rāvana addressed his councillors thus—'O Prahasta,O Sukasārana and other ministers, where hath that personsuddenly gone? Do ye tell me this.' Hearing those wordsof Rāvana the night-rangers said—'That man, who crushethdown the pride of the celestials and demons, hath enteredhither.'"

  "Uttara Kānda": "\"As Garuda goes speedily taking a serpent so thatvicious-minded Rāvana arrived quickly at the entrance of the den.And Rāvana, having no fear, entered therein. And havingentered there he saw males resembling the red collyrium,wearing keyuras,81 heroic, be-decked with red garlands,pasted with red sandal and adorned with diverse goldenornaments and jewels. He saw there three millions of suchhigh-minded persons, devoid of fear, pure, radiant like fire,dancing being mad after festivities. Beholding them theTen-necked demon, of dreadful prowess, was not the leastterrified, and rather saw their dance, standing at the gate.They were all like the male being he had seen before. Theywere all of the same colour, same dress, same figure andequally gifted with great energy. They were all gifted withfour arms and great energy. Beholding them the down of theTen-necked demon stood erect though a boon had beenconferred upon him by the Self-born and he speedily issued outof that place. And he again saw another huge person lyingdown on a bed. His house, seat and bed were all white andvaluable and he was sleeping enveloped by fire. And theresat gracefully with a fan in her lotus hands, the goddessLaksmi—most beautiful in the three worlds—(as if) theornament thereof, chaste, adorned with celestial garlands, sprinkledwith excellent sandal paste, be-decked with rich ornamentsand clad in a precious raiment. Having entered there without any councillor the vicious Rāvana, the lord of Rākshasas,on beholding that chaste damsel with sweet smiles seated ona royal seat, being possessed by desire, grew anxious to holdher by the hand, as one, under the influence of death, catchesa sleeping serpent. Beholding that lord of Rākshasas withloose cloth and understanding him as desirous of holding (her)the deity, having huge arms, asleep and enveloped withflames, laughed aloud. And scorched suddenly by hisenergy, Rāvana, the dread of all people, fell down on earthlike unto an up-rooted tree. Beholding that Rākshasa fallenhe said the following words:—'Rise up, O foremost ofRākshasas, thou shalt not meet with death today; thou shalt liveand be protected, O Rākshasa, by the great Patriarch's boon.Do thou therefore go away, O Rāvana, with confidence—thoushalt not experience death just now.' Regaining his senseinstantly Rāvana was stricken with fear. And being thusaddressed, that enemy, of the celestials, stood up and with hisdown erect, said to that highly resplendant deity—'Who artthou gifted with great energy and like unto the fire ofdissolution? Tell me, who art thou, O deity and whence thou hastcome hither.' Being thus accosted by the vicious-souledRāvana, the deity, smiling, replied in words deep as themuttering of clouds, saying—'What shalt thou do with meO ten-necked demon? Thou art not to be slain by me now.'Being thus addressed the Ten-necked demon, with foldedpalms said—'By the words of the Patriarch (Brahmā) I shallnot tread the path of death; there is none born amongst men, orthe celestials who can equal me, and disregard; by virtue ofhis prowess, the great Patriarch's boon. His words can neverbe falsified—every great exertion is weak before them; I donot behold any such man in the three worlds who can renderthat boon useless. O foremost of the deities, I am immortal—Ido not fear thee; and even if I meet with death, I may have itfrom thee and no one else, O Lord. My death from thee isboth glorious and praise-worthy.' Thereupon Rāvana, giftedwith dreadful prowess, beheld within the body of that deity,all the three worlds with mobile and immobile creations.The Adityas, the Maruts, the Sidhas, the two Aswins,Rudras, the manes, Yama, Kuvera, the oceans, mountains,rivers, all the divisions of the Veda and knowledge, fire,planets, stars, sky, Siddhas, Gandharvas, Chāranas, theascetics conversant with the knowledge of Vedas, Garudaand the serpents, the other deities, Yakshas, Daityas andRākshasas, were all seen in their incorporeal forms, on theperson of that great Purusha, lying down.\" Thereupon thevirtuous-souled Rāma said to Agastya, the foremost ofMunis—\"Who is that male being stationed in the island? Whoare those three kotis male beings? And who is this personwho crusheth down the pride of the Daityās and Dānavas?\"Hearing Rāma's words Agastya said—\"O thou existingeternally, O god of gods, hearken, I shall relate (it) unto thee.The person stationed in the island is the illustrious Kapila.All those dancing persons are the deities equalling thatintelligent Kapila in energy and power. And that Rākshasa,bent on sin, was not seen by him with angry looks, andtherefore, Rāma, Rāvana, was not there and then reduced toashes. And he, resembling a mountain, with his personpierced, fell on the ground. As a wily wight goes through asecret so he pierced (Rāvana's person) with his shaft-likewords. Having regained his sense, however, after a longtime, that Rākshasa, of great prowess, returned where hiscouncillors were.\""

In this wise he got on his chariotmany a female of the Nagas, Rakshas, Asuras, Yakshas,Dānavas and of men. And they, all afflicted, shed tears, hotas firey flames, caused by fear and fire of grief. As the oceanis filled with the currents of the rivers so that car was floodedwith their tears originating from fear and sorrow. And weptthere in the chariot, hundreds of the females of Nagas,Gandharvas, of great ascetics, Daityas and of Dānavas. Theyhad long airs, graceful persons, countenances resembling thefull-moon, rising breast, slender waist like that of a black-beeand were graceful with back like the pole of a car. They werelike the females of the celestials and the burning gold andwere all afflicted by grief, sorrow and terror and were young.And the car was ablaze on all sides with the sighings of thosedamsels and Pushpaka looked like the chamber where fire iskept perpetually. The countenance and eyes, of thosebeautiful damsels, brought under the subjection of theten-necked demon, and afflicted with sorrow, looked poorly likea hind attacked by a lion. Some thought—'Will he eat meup?' and another, stricken with sorrow, thought—'Will hedestroy me?' Thus remembering their mothers, fathers,husbands and brothers, all those females, overwhelmed withgrief and sorrow, bewailed, some exclaiming—'What shallbefall my son in my absence? Alas! into what ocean ofgrief my mother or brother is sunk? Alas! what shall myhusband do in my absence? Therefore, O death, I propitiatethee, do thou take me, who am subject to miseries. Alas!what an iniquity did I perpetrate in my former birth inanother body? Therefore, we all, overwhelmed with grief,are sunk in the ocean of sorrow—and I do not behold the endof my miseries. Oh! fie upon humanity; there is none morevile than a man for they are weak. As the stars disappearwith the rising of the sun in time, so our husbands have beendestroyed by the powerful Rāvana. Oh! highly powerful isthis Raksha and he is mad after devising the means ofdestruction. Alas! being engaged in such vile actions, he does notconsider himself cursed; he is as powerful as he is vicious.And though the ravishment of another's wife is a greats sin,still that vile Rākshasa is enjoying us who belong to others.Therefore this vicious-minded one shall meet with death, byhis own actions.' As soon as these words were uttered by thosechaste damsels, bugles were sounded in heaven and floweryshowers fell on earth. Being thus imprecated by those chastefemales, devoted to their husbands, he became shorn of energyand effulgence and appeared like one divested of mind.Hearing their lamentations thus and being honored by thenight-rangers that foremost of Rākshasas entered his cityLankā. In the interval, Rāvana's sister, a dreadful andgrim-visaged she-demon, suddenly fell down on the ground. Andhaving raised up his sister and consoled her Rāvanasaid—'Tell me speedily, O good sister, what you wish to say.'Thereat that she-demon, having blood-red eyes, closed withtears, said:—'O king, by thee, powerful as thou art, I haveforcibly been made a widow. Fourteen thousand demons,under the name of Kalakeyas, have been destroyed by thee,O king, in the battle and amongst them was my highlypowerful husband—dearer than my life. He has been slain bythee, O dear one, an enemy—a brother only in name. I havebeen killed by thee, O king, who art my brother. For thee,king, I shall enjoy the word 'widow'!82 My husband83should have been saved by thee in the battle. But he wasslain by thy ownself in the battle; art thou not ashamed ofthis?' Being thus addressed by his bewailing sister, theTen-necked demon, consoling her in sweet words, said:—'Of noavail is thy lamentation, dear sister; thou needst not be afraidof any of thy relatives. I shall please thee studiously by gifts,honors and favours. Being mad after war-fare and desirous ofacquiring victory, I was continually making a downpour of shafts,so I could not distinguish in the conflict between my own menand enemies,—and thus unwittingly I did hurt thy husband.And thus, sister, thy husband was slain by me in the conflict;I shall now do whatever shall conduce to thy well-being. Dothou ever reside by the side of thy rich brother Khara andhe shall be the lord of fourteen thousand Rākshasas. Thathighly powerful one shall give food and clothes to all thoseRākshasas. He is thy cousin and that night-ranger shallalways carry out thy orders. Let that hero now speedily goto protect the Dandaka forest and the highly powerfulDushana shall be the commander of his forces. And theheroic Khara shall always obey thy words and be the lord ofRākshasas assuming shapes at will.' Having said this theTen-necked demon issued orders to his army—fourteenthousand highly powerful Rākshasas. Being encircled by thosegrim-visaged Rākshasas, Khara, undaunted, speedily came tothe Dandaka forest. There he governed without thorns andSurpanakha too also resided in the forest of Dandaka.\""

Thereuponthat highly powerful lord of Rākshasas with his followersentered an excellent garden in Lankā named Nikumbhilā.And there, he saw, filled with hundreds of sacrificial postsand altars, a sacrifice being celebrated, as if burning in itslustre. And he beheld his fearful son Meghnāda too, clad inan antelope skin and holding Sikhā and Kamandalu. Havingseen him (there) and embraced him by his arms the lord ofLankā said:—'What are you after, O my child? Tell methe truth.' Thereupon that foremost of twice-born onesUsanas84 of austere penances, wishing the prosperity of thesacrifice, said to Rāvana—the Rākshasa chief:—'Hear, I shallrelate to thee everything, O king; thy son hath met withthe fruits of many a sacrifice—Agnistoma,85 Asvamedha,86Bahusubarnaka,87 Rajsuya,88 Goinedha,89 and Baisnaba.90 Andbeing engaged in this Mahesvvara sacrifice, which is incapableof being celebrated by men, thy son hath obtained boon fromPasupati91 himself."

O lord of Rākshasas, these illusory powers beingused in a conflict, even the celestials and Asuras shall notbe able to perceive his course. Besides he has obtained aquiver, the arrows whereof shall never be exhausted, a bow,which is hard of being got by and a dreadful weapon whichdestroys enemies in a conflict. Having obtained these boonsthy son, O thou having ten faces, and myself, the sacrificebeing finished, have been waiting to behold thee.' Wheretothe Ten-necked demon replied—'You have not done wellas you have worshipped, with diverse articles myenemies—Indra and others. However, what is done is done; there isvirtue in this—no doubt; come, O gentle one, we shall go to ourhouse.' Thereupon going there with his son and Bibhishana,the Ten-necked demon got down all those damsels, speechlesswith tears, gifted with auspicious marks, the precious females ofthe celestials, Dānavas and Raskshasas. Perceiving his viciousdesire for those damsels, the virtuous-souled (Bibhishana)said:—'Thou dost (still) follow thy own whims, knowing thatpeople are injured by these actions which destroy piety,wealth and fame. Having slain their kinsmen thou hastbrought these beautiful damsels hither, but disregarding thee,O king, Madhu hath carried away Kumbhanasi.'Rāvana said:—'I do not understand all this. Who is thatMadhu, who has been named by thee?' Worked up with ireBibhishana said to his brother:—'Hear, the fruit of thy viciousactions hath arrived. There was an old Rākshasa, celebratedfor his wisdom, named Malyavān, the elder brother of Sumālin,our maternal grandfather. His grand-daughter isKumbhanashi and is born of our maternal aunt Analā; so she isvirtually our sister. Thy son being engaged in the sacrificeand myself being under waters she was stolen away, O king,by the powerful Rākshasa Madhu. Kumbhakarna, O greatking, was then asleep. Having slain all the powerfulRākshasas and thy councillors, he had stolen her away, O king, whowas in thy inner apartments. Hearing this even, O greatking, we have pardoned and not slain him: an unmarried girlshould be given away to her husband by her brothers, butthat has not been the case—this is merely the result of thyvicious actions—wicked-minded as thou art, And this thouhast met with instantly—so the people say.' Hearing thewords of Bibhishana, Rāvana, the lord of Rākshasas, becameagitated like an ocean, by the recollection of his viciousdeeds. And enraged, with blood-red eyes the ten-neckeddemon said—'Get my chariot ready soon and let all theheroes of our party be prepared. Let my brotherKumbhakarna and other leading night-rangers, armed with variousweapons, ascend their conveyances. Having slain today inthe encounter that Madhu, who is not afraid of Rāvana, Ishall, encircled by my friends, and desirous of battle, proceedto the region of the celestials.' Thereupon issued out forbattle leading Rākshasas four thousand Akshauhini strongtaking various weapons. Commanding them Indrajit precededthe army, Rāvana went in the middle and Kumbhakarnawas in the rear; the virtuous-souled Bibhisana remainedin Lankā, being engaged in pious observances. And therest of the leading Rākshasas proceeded towards the cityof Madhu. And all the Rākshasas went covering the sky,some on asses, some on camels, some on horses, some onquick-coursing porpoises and some on huge serpents. Andbeholding Rāvana proceed, hundreds of Daityas, inimicalto the celestials, followed him. Having arrived at the cityOf Madhu and entered there the ten-necked demon didnot behold Madhu but espied his sister. Thereupon beingafraid of the king of Rākshasas, Kumbheenashi, with foldedpalms, touched his feet with her crown. Havingraised her up the Rākshasa-chief Rāvana said 'Nofear, what can I do for you?' Whereto she replied—'O king,O thou having long arms,—if thou art pleased with me, donot slay my husband to-day, O conferrer of honours. It issaid there is no other fear like this for damsels of highpedigree. The greatest of fears is that of being a widow. Bethou truthful, O king of kings—do thou look towards me,who am thus begging; Thou hast thyself said, O king; \"Nofear.\"' Being thus addressed Rāvana said to his sisterthere:—'Do thou tell me speedily where is thy husband. I shall gowith him for conquests to the region of the celestials. Outof pity and love for thee I refrain from slaying Madhu.'Being thus accosted; that Rākshasi, being pleased, got hersleeping husband, the night-ranger, up and said:—'Here ismy brother, the highly power Daçagriva. Being desirousof conquering the region of the celestials he prays for thyhelp. Do thou therefore proceed to his help, O Rākshasa,with all they friends; It behoves thee to help him, who outof affection for me, hath prayed for thy help.' Hearingthose words Madhu said:—'So be it.' And approaching alittle he beheld that foremost of Rākshasas and duly welcomedRāvana. Being thus honoured the highly power Daçagrivaspent one night in Madhu's house and then, addressedhimself for departure.

And the interior of theforest was beautified with the brilliant groves of Karnikar, withKadamba and Vakula trees, groves of full blown lotuses, thewaters of Mandākini, with Champaka, Asoka, Punnaga,Mandāra, mangoe, Pātala, Lodra, Pryangu, Arjuna,Ketaka, Tagara, Coconut, Pyāla, Panasa andvarious other trees. And there sang the Kinnaras,possessed by desire, and having sweet voice, enhancing thedelight of the mind. And there danced mirthfully, with theirdamsels, the Vidyadharas, inebriete and having their eyesreddened with drink. There was audible in the house ofthe lord of riches, the sweet music of the assembledApsarās like unto the sound of the bell. And being shaken bythe wind the nectar-smelling trees made the hill fragrancewith the shower of flowers. And carrying the fragrancerendered salutary with honey and filaments of flowers, theexcellent wind blew enhancing Rāvana's desire. Beingpossessed by desire through songs, richness of flowers, coldnessof air, beauty of the hills, and the rising of the moon innight, the highly powerful Rāvana espied again and againthe moon with heavy sighs. At this time passed by that waythe foremost of Apsarās, Rambhā, adorned with excellentornaments and having a countenance like the full moon. Herperson was sprinkled with excellent sandal paste—her hairswere decked with Mandāra flowers—her body was beautifiedwith other flowers and her movements tended to increasedesire. Her eyes were beautiful and her waist was high,adorned with Mekhala92 and was as if the refuge of Rati93.Her forehead and other parts of the countenance werepainted with the marks of red sandal and adorned withornaments of flowers growing in six seasons. Rambhāappeared like second Sree, in grace and beauty, natural andartificial. She wore green clothes resembling the clouds; herface was like the moon, eye brows like excellent bows, thighslike the trunks of elephants and palms soft as leaves. Shewas seen by Rāvana as proceeding in the midst of soldiers.Having got up and been influenced by lust he took her,shameful as she was, by the hand and smilingsaid:—'Where art thou going, O beautiful damsel? Whom artthou going of thy own accord to satisfy? Whose prosperoustime hath appeared, with whom thou shalt enjoy? Whoshall be satisfied with drinking the nectar of thy mouthsmelling like lotus? Whose breast, O fair damsel,thy rising breast beautiful like two golden pots closelyplaced, shall touch? Who is there so beautiful as I—Indra,Vishnu, or two Aswins that thou art passing by me? Do thoutake rest upon this excellent rock, O thou having charmingwaist. There is no other lord, save me, in the three worlds.And Daçānana, the lord of the lords of the three worlds,thus begs thee, with folded palms. Do thou therefore seekme.' Being thus addressed, Rambhā, trembling, with foldedpalms, said:—'Be thou propitiated; it doth not behove theeto speak thus, who art my superior. Rather shouldst thouprotect me if any body else trieth to oppress me. VirtuallyI am thy daughter-in-law. I speak to thee the truth.'Thereupon the Ten-necked demon said to her, standing with herface downwards, and her down standing erect at his verysight. 'Hadst thou been the wife of my son, thouwouldst have been my daughter-in-law.' Whereto Rambhāreplied:—'Truely it is; I am, by virtue, the wife of thyson, O foremost of Rākshasas. Thy brother Vaisrabanahath a son, dearer than his life, celebrated in the threeworlds under the name of Nalakuvara, In virtue he isunto a Brahmin, in prowess he equals a Kshatriya, in angerhe is very fire and in patience he is like the earth. Ibeen thus directed by that Lokapāla's son. For him Ihave adorned my person with these ornaments. I am notattached to any body else but him. O king, O slayer offoes, by virtue of (this relation) it behoveth thee to saveme. And that virtuous-souled one is anxiously expectingme. Thou shouldst not put obstacle in that; it behoveth theeto let me go; do thou, O foremost of Rākshasas, wend theway treaded by the pious. Thou art worthy of being reveredby me and I am an object of thy protection.' Being thusaddressed Daçagriva humbly replied:—'\"I amdaughter-in-law,\" as thou hast said, is worthy of being said by onewho is the only wife. This is the everlasting law of thecelestials that the Apsarās have no husband; they cannotbe the wife of one husband.' Having said this, the Raksharavished her. Being released from his grasp Rambhā becamedivested of her ornaments and garland and became like theriver agitated by the elephants. Her hairs were dishevelledand her hands were trembling. Like unto a blossomingcreeper shaken by the wind, she, trembling and bashfuland with folded hands, went to Nalakuvara and felldown at his feet. Having seen her in that plight thehigh-souled Nalakuvara said—'O fair one, what is this? Whyhast thou placed thyself at my feet?' Sighing heavilyand trembling she, with folded palms, related to himeverything from the beginning to the end. 'O lord, on his way toheaven, Daçagriva hath arrived here and hath spent thenight with his army. While I was coming to thee, O slayerof foes, I was seen by him. Then holding me he said—\"Whereart thou going?\" I related to him everything truly. Butbeing possessed by lust he did not pay heed to my words.He was again prayed by me, O lord, saying \"I am thydaughter-in-law.\" But neglecting that he ravished me. Othou of firm vows, it behoveh thee to forgive me for thisfolly. O gentle one, a woman's strength can neverequal that of a man.' Hearing of this ravishmentVaisravana's son was greatly enraged and entered intomeditation. Having ascertained the truth within a momentVaisravana's son, with eyes reddened with ire, took waterin his palms. Having taken this and rinsed his mouth duly,he imprecated a dreadful curse upon that lord of Rākshasas.'O fair one, since thou hast been ravished by him despitethy unwillingness he shall never be able to get by anunwilling damsel. Whenever he shall, stricken by lust,ravish a reluctant damsel, his head shall be sundered intoseven pieces'. As soon as this curse, like unto a burningflame, was uttered, the celestial bugles were sounded anda shower of flowers fell from heavens. Being apprised ofthe plight of people (brought about by him) and of thedeath of that Rākshasa the patriarch Brahmā and othergods were greatly delighted. Hearing of that curse capableof making the down erect, Daçagriva abstained fromentertaining lust for unwilling females. And hearing of the curseimprecated by Nalakuvara all the chaste damsels, that werekept captive, attained to great delight.\""

  "Uttara Kānda": "\"Having crossed the mount Kailāça, the highly powerfulTen-necked demon, with his army, reached the region ofIndra. And there arose in the region of celestials an uproarfrom the Rākshasa army, like unto the sound of the agitateddeep. Hearing of the arrival of Rāvana, Indra shook on histhrone and said to the assembled gods, Adityas, Vasus,Rudras, Sadhyas and Maruts—'Prepare yourselves, forfighting with the vicious-souled Rāvana.' Being thusaddressed by Sakra, the celestials, his equals in the encounterand gifted with great prowess, armed themselves for fight.And Mahendra, afraid of Rāvana, poorly went to Vishnu andgave vent to the following accents:—'How shall I, O Vishnu,withstand, the Rākshasa Rāvana? The highly powerfulRākshasa hath come here for battle. It is by virtue of theboon that he is powerful, not for anything else. It is properto make the words uttered by Brahmā, truthful. As resortingto thy prowess I destroyed Namuchi, Yitra, Bali, Nānrinand Samvara, so do thou make some arrangements (for hisdestruction). There is no other excellent refuge but thee inthe three worlds, mobile and immobile, O lord, O god of gods,O slayer of Madhu. Thou art the graceful, ever-existingNārāyana, having a lotus navel. By thee the worlds havebeen settled and myself and Sakra, the lord of the celestials.Thou hast created the three worlds, the mobile and immobileand in thee all these shall, O glorious deity, end at the timeof dissolution. Do thou tell me, the truth, O god of gods,that I may myself fight; or do thou, with thy sword anddiscus, vanquish Rāvana.' Being thus addressed by Sakrathe lord Nārāyana; said:—'Do not fear, hear what I say.He is invincible by virtue of the boon, and that vicious-souledone is incapable of being vanquished even by the celestialsand Asuras. Irrepressible by virtue of his prowess, thatRākshasa, with his son, shall accomplish a mighty object.O lord of celestials, even if I am requested by thee, I shallnot withstand the Rākshasa, Rāvana in the conflict. Withoutslaying the enemies in the encounter, Vishnu doth never goback—but it is hard to fulfill my desire from Rāvana, wellprotected by the boon. However I do promise before thee,O lord of the celestials, O performer of hundred sacrifices, Ishall, soon become the cause of this Rākshasa's death. Ishall soon destroy Rāvana with his family in due time andafford delight unto the celestials. I speak the truth untothee, O king of the celestials, O lord of Sachi; do thoudivested of fear, fight, O thou gifted with great strength,along with the celestials.' Thereupon having issued out ofthe city, Rudras, Adityas, Vusus, Maruts and Aswinswell-armed with mails, appeared before the Rākshasas.Meanwhile at the latter part of the night there was audible theuproar of Rāvana's army fighting on all sides. Havinggot up and cast their looks upon one another the highlypowerful Rākshasas waited there for the battle, delighted.Thereupon beholding that inexhaustible huge army at thecommencement of the battle the celestial host lost heart.Thereupon there ensued a conflict, setting up a terriblesound, with various weapons between the Rākshasas andgods. In the interval issued out for encounter the heroicand grim-visaged Rākshasas—Rāvana's councillors. Andencircled by Māricha, Prahasta, Mahāparswa, Mahodara,Akampana, Nikumbha, Suka, Sārana, Sanghrāda, Dhumaketu,Mahādangstra, Gathodara, Jāmbumāli, Mahāhrada,Virupāksha, Suptaghna, Yajnakopa, Durmukha, Khara, Trisirā,Karaveerāksha, Suryyasatru Mahākāya, Atikāya, Devāntaka,Narāntaka,—all those gifted with great prowess, there enteredthe battle-field, the highly powerful Sumālin, Rāvana'smaternal grandfather. And with various sharp-pointedweapons, he, highly angered, began to assail the celestial hostlike unto the winds scattering clouds. Being thus distressedby the night-rangers the host of the gods fled away intodiverse directions like a herd of deer attacked by a lion. Inthe meantime, entered the battle-field, the heroic and braveSavitra, the eighth Vasu, encircled by soldiers and strikingterror into the hearts of the enemies. And the two Adityas,the highly powerful Tushthā, and Pushā united and undaunted,entered the arena. Thereupon there arose with Rākshasasa terrible encounter of the celestials unable to bear theirfame in battle. Then the Rākshasas, with thousands ofterrible weapons, began to belabour the deities in theencounter. And the celestials, as well, began to send theredoubtable, powerful and terrific Rākshasas, with the strokeof blameless weapons, to the abode of Death. In the interim,O Rāma, a Rākshasa, Sumālin, by name, getting enragedand with diverse weapons, ran amock of the soldiery. Asthe winds scatter clouds, so, he, under the influence of rage,with various sharpened weapons, committed a havoc amongstthe celestial soldiers. Thereupon being assailed by adownpour of huge shafts, maces, Prāsas and diverse dreadfulweapons, the celestials could not keep their ground upon thefield of warfare. The celestials being thus distressed bySumālin the eighth Vasu Sāvitra stood there enraged. Andencircled by his own car-warriors that highly powerful one,with his prowess, repulsed the striking night-rangers.Thereupon there arose a terrible encounter, capable of makingdown erect, between Sumālin and the Vasu, who did notretire from the field of battle. His chariot drawn byserpents was pulled down and destroyed by the high-souledVasu by means of his huge shafts. Having taken up thatcar in the warfare with hundreds of arrows Vasu took upmace in his hands for his destruction. Having taken up thatmace having a burning head and resembling the rod of DeathSāvitra struck Sumālin on his head therewith. Having failedon his head that mace shone like a fire-brand as thethunderbolt, discharged by Indra, falls roaring on the summit of amountain. By the stroke of that mace his person wasreduced to ashes and therefore there was not seen in the battlefield either his bone, head or flesh. Having beheld him slainin the warfare the Rākshasas bewailing ran about on allsides and being distressed by Vasu they could not stay in thebattle field.\""

  "Uttara Kānda": "\"Beholding Sumālin slain and reduced to ashes by Vasuand being assailed by the deities the Rākshasa host fled intodiverse directions. And collecting all the Rākshasas stoodthere the highly powerful Meghanāda, enraged, the son ofRāvana. Like unto flaming fire approaching towards forestthat great car-warrior encountered the enemies in a preciouscar coursing at will. And as soon as he, armed with variousweapons, entered the field the celestials, at his very sight, fledaway to all directions. None could stand before him,well-versed in war-fare. Thereupon beholding the deities terrifiedand pierced with shafts, Indra, the king of gods, said—'Benot afraid, O ye celestials; do not fly away; come back to thebattle; this my son, who has never been vanquished, goes tobattle.' Thereupon Sakra's son, known as divine Jayanta,proceeded towards the field of action in a wondrous car.And having encircled Sachi's son and encountered Rāvana'sson the deities began to assail him. And the encounterbetween Mahendra's son Jayanta and Rāvana's son Meghanāda,and that between the deities and Rakshas was like onebetween gods and demons. Thereupon Rāvana's son began toassail, with shafts feathered in gold, his (Jayanta's) charioteerGomukha, Mātali's son. Sachis' son too, enraged, assailedon all sides, Rāvana's son and his charioteer. And thepowerful Rāvani, stricken with ire and with eyes expanded,covered Sakra's son with arrows. Thereupon Rāvana's sonstruck the celestial host with thousands of huge mountainsummits, Sataghnis, maces, Prasas, clubs, daggers, Parashusand various other sharp pointed weapons, Rāvana's sonthus striking Indra's army the quarters were enshroudedwith darkness by his illusory power. Being overpoweredwith arrows on all sides the celestial army, leaving asideJayanta, became restless. The deities or the Rākshasa—theycould not recognize one another—and being distressed theyran about on all sides. Being enveloped with darkness andhaving their senses bewildered the celestials killed their ownkith and the Rākshasas their own men—and others fled away.In the interim a heroic and powerful Daitya-chief—Pulomāby name, taking Sachi's son disappeared. And taking hisown grand-son he entered into the ocean—Pulomā was hisgrand-father for by him Sachi was begotten. And thinkingthat Jayanta was slain all the deities greatly sorry anddistressed fled away on all sides. Thereupon Rāvana's son,enraged and encircled by his own powerful followers, pursuedthe celestials emitting loud cries. Not beholding his son andobserving the flight of the deities the king of the celestialssaid to Mātali—'Bring my car.' By Mātali was brought,the celestial, highly dreadful, huge and quick-coursing chariot,that was ready. (And he having) ascended the car, the hugeclouds, with lightnings, being driven by winds, began to emitforth loud mutterings before the chariot. And theGandharvas began to play on various instruments and the Apsarāsbegan to dance. And taking up various weapons, Indra, theking of divinities, set out for the field of action, in thecompany of Rudras, Vasus, Adityas, the two Aswins andMaruts. He, having set out for battle, the wind began toblow high, the sun was divested of its brilliance and the hugefire-brands began to send out flames. In the interval theheroic and the highly powerful Daçagriva ascended thecelestial car, constructed by the Architect of the deities,encircled by the huge-bodied serpents capable of makingdown erect and by whose breath the battle-field was ablaze.Surrounded by demons and night-rangers and with thecelestial car he encountered Mahendra in the battle-field.And having desisted his son he himself stood there. Andhaving come out from the field of action Rāvana's son toostood silent. Thereupon there arose an encounter betweenthe Rākshasas and the deities and there began a downpour ofweapons in the conflict like clouds. And the vicious-souledKumbhakarna armed with various weapons camethere—but he did not know,94 O king, with whom the conflict wasgoing on. And by him enraged, the celestials were assailedwith his teeth, feet, arms, hands, Saktis, Tomaras and clubsor any weapon whatsoever. Thereupon the night-rangerengaged with the highly powerful Rudras and was wounded,in the conflict, with incessant strokes of weapons.Thereupon the Rākshasa army began to fight with Marutsand they were overwhelmed in the encounter withthe stroke of various weapons. Some fell down on earthslain and torn and others became insensible on the backof their carriers in the battle. And they all stood there in ahalf-sensible mood, some holding the car, some elephants,some asses, some camels, some serpents, some horses, someporpoises, some boars, some Pisaca-mouthed animals and someembracing the Pannagas. And other night-rangers, havingtheir bodies sundered by the deities gave up their being. TheRākshasas being slain and lying down on earth the actionappeared wondrous like a painting. And there issued out in thebattle-field a river from weapons having blood for its silentwaters and infested with crows and vultures. Having beheld hisown army slain by the deities the highly powerful Daçānana,enraged, entered the ocean of celestial army and slaying thedeities in the conflict confronted Sakra. Thereupon Sakratook up his huge bow by the twang where-of the ten quartersWere filled. Having unstrung his huge bow Indra struckRāvana, on his head, with arrows resembling the flame offire and the rays of the sun. And the Rākshasa-chiefDaçānana, having long arms, also assailed Indra with hundredsof shafts discharged off his bow. They having been thusengaged with each other with the downpour of dreadfulshafts, all the quarters were filled with darkness and inconsequence thereof nothing was visible.\""

And in that darkness—Indra, Rāvanaand Meghanāda—these three were not possessed by theinfluence of illusion. Beholding his whole army slain in amoment, Rāvana, worked up with dreadful ire, sent outterrible roars. And in anger, that irrepressible one said tothe charioteer, stationed on the car—'Do thou take me tothe other end of the enemies' host. I shall soon with thestroke of various weapons despatch the deities to the abodeof Death. I shall slay Indra, Kuvera, Varuna andYama—what to speak of more—I shall soon destroy all the deitiesand place myself above them. Be not sorry; do thou soondrive my chariot. To-day I have told you twice to take meto the end of the enemy's army. We are now waiting nearthe Nandana grove—do thou take me to the hill whence thesun rises.' Hearing his words the charioteer drove thesteeds, coursing at will through the enemies' host.Thereupon being apprised of his intention, Sakra,the king of the celestials, stationed on car, saidto the deities, in the field of battle—'O ye deities—hearmy words, what appear to me best. This Ten-neckeddemon must be vanquished by us while alive. Ascending hiscar, gifted with the velocity of the wind, the highly powerfulone is proceeding amongst the army like unto the deep withwaves rising during Parva. It is not possible to slay himnow—for he shall not meet with death in consequence ofthe boon. So let us make him captive—and we should allexert to that end. Bali being held captive I am enjoyingthe three worlds—and I think proper to obstruct the courseof this vicious-souled one.' Having said this and left asideRāvana, Sakra went to another side, O King, and foughtterrifying the Rākshasas in the conflict. Dacagriva,incapable of being thwarted, entered by the northern routeand the performer of hundred sacrifices by the southern.Thereupon having entered into the army up to a hundredleagues—the lord of Rākshasas overpowered the celestialhost with a downpour of shafts. Thereupon beholding hisown army slain, Sakra returned fearlessly and obstructedthe Ten-necked demon. In the interim beholding Rāvanabrought under his grasp by Sakra the demons and Rākshasascried aloud. 'Alas we are slain.' Thereupon ascendinghis car Rāvana's son, beside himself with rage, entered thedreadful flank. And having resorted to the illusory powers,conferred upon him in yore by Paçupati he entered into theenemies' camp and belaboured them. Having left behind allother deities he pursued Indra and the highly effulgentMahendra too espied his enemy's son. And albeit assailedby the highly powerful deities, Rāvana's son, divested ofmail, entertained no fear. Having overpowered theapproaching charioteer with many excellent arrows he coveredMahendra with a downpour of shafts. Thereat having lefthis car and charioteer Indra mounted his elephant Airavatand ran about in search of Rāvana's son. Being invisiblein the welkin by virtue of his illusory powers and havingbrought Indra under the influence thereof he struck himwith hundreds of arrows. When Rāvana's son came toknow that Indra was exhausted he, having bound him upby virtue of illusion, proceeded towards his army. Andhaving seen Mahendra carried away by force from thebattle field the deities thought 'What is this?' Thatconqueror of Sakra and subduer of enemies, conversantwith illusory powers, was not visible, by whom, Indra,although master of many illusions, was carried away byforce. In the meantime, the celestials, all enraged, coveredRāvana with a downpour of shafts and belaboured him.And being worn out in the encounter with the Adityasand Vasus he was not capable of fighting any more.Beholding his father thus distressed and assailed inwarfare with strokes, Rāvana's son, although invisible, said—'Dothou come O father, our work in the battle field is finished;know, we have achieved victory; be thou consoled anddivested of agonies. By virtue of my illusory powers I havemade Mahendra captive—the lord of the three worldsand of the celestial host and have crushed down the prideof the deities. Having subdued thy enemy by virtue of thyprowess do thou enjoy the three worlds at thy pleasure.What is the use of labouring again? And useless it is tofight again.' Hearing the words of Rāvana's son thedeities retired from the battle field, and went away withoutSakra. And hearing the sweet words of his son, the lordof the night-rangers, the enemy of the celestials, having greatprowess and wide spread fame, desisted from fighting andaffectionately said to his son—'Thou hast enhanced the glory ofour race displaying thy prowess like a highly powerfulman. Thou hast vanquished the celestials and their kingof unequalled might. Do thou set out hence for the city,taking Indra on thy chariot and surrounded by soldiers. Ishall, soon, delighted, follow thee with my councillors.'Thereupon having returned home with his army andchariots and taking the king of the celestials, the powerfulson of Rāvana dismissed the victorious warriors.\""

Having obtained Rāvanaencircled by his sons and brothers the Patriarch, stationed inthe welkin, calmly said—'My son, Rāvana, I havebeen pleased with thy son in the conflict. Oh! whatwonderful prowess, what strength—equal or greater thanthine. Thou hast, by thy own prowess, conquered the threeworlds—thy promise hath borne fruits—I have been pleasedwith you—both the father and son. O Rāvana, this thy sonis highly powerful and gifted with great strength and he shallbe celebrated in the world under the appellation of 'Indrajit'or the conqueror of Indra. And that Rākshasa shall bepowerful and irrepressible, by whose help, O king, thecelestials have been brought under thy subjection. Do thoutherefore, O thou having long arms, release Mahendra, thechastiser of Paka and for setting him free what do thou wantfrom the celestials?' Thereupon the highly powerfulIndrajit—the subduer of enemies, said:—'If dost thou say so, O god,I pray for immortality.' Thereat the highly powerfulpatriarch said to Meghanada—'There is none perfectlyimmortal on earth amongst created beings—birds, quadrupedsand other highly powerful beings.' Hearing the wordsuttered by the grand-father—the highly powerful Meghanādasaid to the eternal lord—'Hear, then, what I want in exchangefor releasing Sakra. May a chariot with horses rise up fromfire when I shall offer sacrifices unto it, being desirous ofvanquishing my enemies in the conflict. And may I beimmortal as long as I shall remain on that car. This is theboon I have resolved upon praying for. May I meet withdestruction, O deity, whenever I shall engage in fight withoutfinishing my offerings unto fire. All others, O god, attainto immortality by virtue of devout penances but I shall acquirethat by dint of my own prowess.' Whereto the grand-fatherreplied saying 'So be it.' Thereupon Meghanāda releasedIndra and the celestials returned to their own abode. In theinterval, O Rāma, Indra became poorly, divested of hisimmortal brilliance, stricken with anxiety and pensive.Beholding him in that plight the grand-father of the deitiessaid:—'O performer of hundred sacrifices, why didst thouformerly perpetrate that mighty iniquity? O Chief of theimmortals! O lord! Some creatures were created by meby dint of my understanding—they were all of the samecolour, same speech, and same appearance. There was nodifference visible in their appearance or marks. Thereupon,with whole-minded-ness, I began to think of these createdbeings. And I created a female distinct from them.Collecting all those limbs that were most excellent amongst thecreated, I made a female under the name of Ahalyā. Halmeans ugliness—one born from Hal is called Halya. Thatfemale was known as Ahalyā because she had nothingblameable in her. I gave her that name. Having created thatfemale I was thinking, O king of the celestials! O foremostof the deities! On whom I should confer her. Being proud ofdignity, O Sakra, O lord, O Purandara thou didst regard herin thy mind as thy spouse. I placed her under the care ofthe high-souled Gautama and he rendered her back aftermany long years. Thereupon considering the patience andaccomplished asceticism of Gautama I married her with him.And that virtuous-souled, great ascetic enjoyed her company;and for my thus conferring her upon Gautama all thecelestials were disappointed. But being enraged andpossessed by lust thou didst repair to the hermitage of the asceticand see her resplendant like the flaming fire. Maddenedwith lust and ire thou didst ravish her and thou wast seen inthat hermitage by the great ascetic. Thou wast thenimprecated by him, enraged and gifted with great effulgence saying,\"O lord of the celestials, thou hast attained to a change ofcircumstances—for which, O Vasava, thou hast fearlesslyravished my spouse. Thou shalt, therefore, O Sakra, gounder the arms of the enemies, in conflict. And this viledesire, O thou having a vicious intellect, which thou hast firstcreated, shall undoubtedly spread in the world of mortals.Whoever shall commit this crime, shall be half responsiblefor it and the other half shall descend upon thee; andforsooth thy position shall not be permanent. And whoevershall be the lord of the celestials, shall not have his positionsecure. This is the curse I give, which I have communicated tothee.\" And having remonstrated with his wife that one ofdevout penances said to her—\"O vicious one, let thy beautybe spoiled in the vicinity of the hermitage. Thou art giftedwith beauty and youth but thy mind is fickle; so thou shalt notcontinue as the single beautiful damsel in the world. Allcreated beings shall participate thy beauty; thy matchless beauty hasbrought about this mischief.\" Thenceforward all created beingswere gifted with beauty. Thereupon she propitiated theascetic Gautama saying, \"O twice-born one, I was unwittinglyravished by Indra, assuming thy form. I have not committedthis willingly, O ascetic—so do thou be propitiated with me.\"Ahalyā having said this, Gautama replied:—\"In the race ofIkshwākus, there shall be born a highly effulgent and mightycar-warrior, known in the world as Rāma; for performingthe rites of a Brahman, the mighty-armed Vishnu, assuming ahuman form, shall repair to the forest. Thou shalt be purifiedwhen thou shalt behold him, O fair damsel. He shall be able topurify thee from the iniquity perpetrated. Having treated himas a guest when thou shalt come to me again, thou shaltlive with me, O thou having a fair countenance.\" Havingsaid this that ascetic returned to his hermitage. Andthenceforward the wife, of that ascetic chanting thethemes of Brahman, engaged in austere penances. Thouhast met with all this in consequence of the imprecationof that ascetic. Therefore, O thou having long arms, dothou think of thy past iniquity. For that curse andnothing else, O Vasava, thou hast been brought under thegrasp of enemies. Having controlled thy senses, do thousoon undertake a sacrifice in honor of Vishnu. Thou shaltbe purified by that sacrifice and go to heaven; and thyson, O lord of celestials, hath not been destroyed in theconflict. He hath been taken into the ocean by his grandfather.' Hearing this and having celebrated the sacrificein honor of Vishnu he again went to the region of celestialsand reigned there as their king. I have thus describedto thee the strength of Indrajit—what to speak of othershe vanquished even Indra—the king of the celestials.\"Hearing the words of Agastya, Rāma, Lakshmana, Vānarasand Rākshasas all said \"Wonderful it is,\" andBibhishana, who was by the side of Rāma, said:—\"After along time, the old recollections have come to my mind.\"Thereupon Rāma said to Agastya—\"All, thou hast said, istrue.\" And Agastya said \"Rāma, Rāvana, the thorn ofpeople, then grew in power, by whom, in the companyof his son, Indra, the lord of the celestials, was defeated.\""

And many kings I (hear) werevanquished and driven out by him with various excellentweapons.\" Hearing the words of Rāghava, the asceticAgastya, having six sorts of wealth, laughing said, like untoBrahmā, speaking to Rudra—\"O Rāma, O lord of earth,traversing the earth, Rāvana arrived at the city of Mahismati,resembling the city of the celestials, where lived perpetuallythe deity of fire. There reigned a king named Arjuna,effulgent like fire which was kept perpetually in a well coveredwith Sara. One day the highly powerful Arjuna, the kingof Haihayas, repaired to the river Nerbuda, with his wives tosport. At the very same day, Rāvana, the lord of Rākshasas,arrived there and asked his councillors saying. 'Where isthe king Arjuna? Do ye speedily tell me; I am Rāvana,I have come to fight with your king. Do ye, at first,communicate unto him the news of my arrival.' Being thusaddressed by Rāvana, the learned ministers informed thelord of Rākshasas, of the absence of the king. Hearing ofthe absence of the king from the citizens Visrasraba's soncame out of the city and reached the Vindhya mountainresembling the Himalayas. He espied the mountainextending over the welkin like unto clouds and rising up as ifriving the earth and obstructing the sky. The mountain hada thousand summits and the lions were residing in the cavesand hundreds of fountains were falling from it; the mountainwas as if laughing aloud and the celestials, Gandharvas,Apsarās and Kinsaras were sporting there with their females;and it appeared (in consequence thereof) like the region ofcelestials; and rivers, with waters transparent like crystal,were flowing. And it therefore appeared like a thousandserpents having trembling tongues. And casting hislooks upon Vindhya mountain, resembling the Himalayasand having huge caves, Rāvana, the king of Rākshasas,reached the river Nerbuda, of holy waters and goingrapidly to the western ocean. Her waters were beingagitated by buffaloes, deer, tigers, lions, bears and elephantsdistressed by heat. Having covered her, Chakrabakas,Kārandavas, swans, water-cocks and Sārasas, maddened, wereemitting notes. The charming Nerbuda appeared like abeautiful damsel—having blossoming trees for her ornaments,Chakrabakas for her breast, wide spread forest for her waist,the row of swans for Mekhala, filaments of flowers for paste,watery foams for white silken cloth, the pleasure of descendinginto water for the pleasure of touch and full-blown lotusesfor white eyes. Having descended from his car and bathedin the waters of Nerbuda, the foremost of streams,resembling a fair one, Rāvana, the lord of Rākshasas, with thiscouncilors, sat on her coast resided by many an ascetic.Delighted at her beauty and having spoken highly of Nerbudalike unto Ganges he addressed his ministers Suka and Sāranawith gestures, saying:—'Behold, having rendered the earthpale, with his many rays, the sun, emitting parchingheat, is in the sky. But seeing me here seated,his rays have become cool like those of the moon.At my fear, even the wind is blowing carefully, beingcold and fragrant by the touch of the waters of the Nerbudaand removing our toil. This charming Nerbuda, aboundingin crocodiles, fishes and birds, though a natural stream, isstanding still like a terrified damsel. Being wounded inconflicts with many a king your persons have been pastedwith blood. Therefore like unto Sarvabhauma and otherinfuriated elephants going down into the water of theGanges, do ye descend into the water of Nerbuda conferringauspiciousness and health. Bathing in this stream you shallbe cleansed from sins. I shall, also on the coast of this river,like the rays of the autumnal moon, reverentially worship withflowers Mahādeva, holding Pināka in his hands.' Hearing thewords of Rāvana, Prahasta, Suka, Sārana, Mahodara,Dhrumākshya and other councillors descended into the watersof Nerbuda. And she was agitated by thoseelephant-like leading Rākshasas like unto the Ganges by Vamana,Anjana, Padma and other elephants, Thereupon havinggot up from the waters the highly powerful Rākshasasculled flowers for Rāvana's offerings. And in a momentthe Rākshasas collected heaps of flowers on thepicturesque banks of Nerbuda, resembling the white clouds.Flowers being thus collected, Rāvana, the king of Rākshasasdescended, into the Nerbuda for bathing like ahuge elephant into the Ganges. And having bathed he gotup, reciting excellent incantations. Thereupon having leftoff his wet cloth he put on a white one. And to find outplace for worshipping, he, with folded hands, proceededtowards the banks. And the Rākshasas too, like unto somany moving mountains, followed him. And whereverRāvana went the golden Siva Linga was brought.Thereupon Rāvana placed that upon a heap of sandsand began to worship it with various nectar-smellingflowers and sandal. And having finished the worship ofSiva, the foremost of deities, having the moon on hiscrown, the conferrer of boons and the remover of miseries,the night-ranger danced with uplifted hands and sangbefore it.\""

  "Uttara Kānda": "\"At no distance from where on the banks of theriver Nerbuda, that dreadful lord of Rākshasas collected theflowers, Arjuna, the King of Mahismati, and the foremostof the victorous, was sporting with his wives in the water.And being encircled by them the king Arjuna appearedlike a leading elephant surrounded by a thousands of sheelephants. In order to measure the strength of his thousandarms the King of Haihayas obstructed the course ofNerbuda. Being obstructed by the arms ofKārtavirjarjuna and having flooded the banks with her purewaters, Nerbuda flowed in an opposite direction. Andthe currents, rising high as during the rainy seasonflowed with fishes, and crocodiles. And that stream, as ifdriven against Rāvana by Kārtavirjarjuna, carried away hiscollection of flowers. And having given up his worship whichwas half-finished Rāvana looked towards Nerbuda lookinglike an unwilling damsel and saw that she, with rising currents,was flowing towards the east from the west and the watersbeyond that were in a natural state like a quiet lady and thebirds were seated there without any anxiety. Thereupon beinganxious to learn the cause of the rise of the river, theTen-necked demon, with his right finger, hinted Suka and Sārana.Being commanded by Rāvana, the two brothers, the heroicSuka and Sārana proceeded towards the west by the aerialway. And going half a league, the two night-rangers espieda man sporting in the waters with some females. He was hugeas a Sāla tree, his hairs were floating on the water, he wasinebriete and his eyes were reddened in consequence thereof.Like unto Sumeru holding the earth with his thousand feethe obstructed the current of the river with his thousand arms.And he was surrounded by a thousands of beautiful damsels likean elephant by a thousands of she-elephants. Beholding thatdreadful spectacle, the Rākshasas Suka and Sārana cameback and approaching Rāvana communicated (all) unto him.'O lord of Rākshasas, an unknown person, huge as a Sālatree, is sporting with females obstructing the course ofNerbuda like unto a dam. And being withheld by thethousand arms of that man the waters of Nerbuda werecontinually throwing up high waves.' Hearing the words ofSuka and Sārana, Rāvana exclaimed 'This is Arjuna' andproceeded to fight with him. Rāvana, the lord of Rākshasas,having set out with a hostile intention against Kārtavirjarjuna,the wind mixed with dust began to blow high with tumultuoussound. And the clouds began to mutter with a downpour ofrain. And the lord of Rākshasas proceeded against Arjunawith Mahodara, Mahaparswa, Dhrumākshya, Suka andSairana. Within a short time the dreadful Rākshasa,powerful as the elephant Arjuna, reached the banks of Nerbudaand espied there Arjuna encircled by females as an elephantsurrounded by she-elephants. At the very sight the eyes ofthe lord of Rākshasas, proud of his prowess, grew red andaddressing the councillors of the king Arjuna he said 'Doye communicate unto the king of Haihayas that Rāvana, thelord of Rākshasas, hath come to fight with him.' Hearingthe words of Rāvana, the ministers of Arjuna stood up witharms and said 'O good Rāvana, thou art well cognizantof the proper time for fighting. Now our king is drunk and issporting with the females in the waters. And now dost thouwish to fight with him. Therefore, O Ten-necked one, dothou spend the night here, if thou art bent upon fighting. Oreven if thou art anxious to enter speedily into conflict withArjuna do thou slay us all at first, and then fight with theking.' Thereupon the hungry councillors of Rāvana slewsome of the ministers of the king and devoured some. Therearose a dreadful uproar on the banks of Nerbuda, of thecouncillors of Rāvana and Arjuna. The warriors of Arjunaassailed Rāvana and his ministers with hundreds of arrows,Praças, darts, Tomaras, thunder-bolts and Karpanas. Thewarriors of Arjijna became dreadfully furious and emitted crieslike the roaring of the deep infested with crocodiles, fishesand other marine monsters. Thereupon being enraged anddisplaying their own prowess Suka, Sārana and otherministers of Rāvana began to destroy Arjuna's soldiers.Thereupon the emissaries, stricken with fear, went to thesporting king and communicated unto him the proceedings ofRāvana and his ministers. Hearing those words and sayingunto the females 'Do not fear' he rose up from the waters likean elephant. The eyes of that fire-like Arjuna were reddenedwith ire and he shone dreadfully like the fire of dissolution.And taking up speedily his club, that one, always usinggolden clubs, pursued the Rākshasas like unto darknessfollowing the sun. Holding up the huge club and hurlingit with his arms, Arjuna, resorting to the velocity of Garuda,went on. Thereupon stood there obstructing his course theRākshasa, worked up with anger and with a mace in hishand, like unto the Vindhya range standing in the way ofthe sun. And throwing down off his hand the iron mace,he, in anger, began to roar, like Yama. And the top of themace was ablaze like the tips of Asoka flowers. Not theleast agitated on beholding that mace, the king Arjuna, byhis club, baffled its action. Thereupon uplifting the hugeclub, five hundred hands long, the king of Haihayas pursuedPrahasta. And within a short time being struck down bythat club gifted with great velocity Prahasta fell down onearth like unto the summit of a mountain clapped down bythe thunder-bolt of Indra. Beholding Prahasta fallen,Māricha, Suka, Sārana, Mahodara and Dhrumākshya fledaway from the battle-field. All the councillors having thusfled away and Prahasta being slain Rāvana speedilyproceeded towards Arjuna, the foremost of kings. Thereuponthere ensued a terrible encounter capable of making downerect between the thousand-armed Arjuna, the king of men,and the twenty-armed Rāvana, the king of Rākshasas.And taking up their clubs Arjuna and Rāvana began tofight with one another emitting cries like the mutteringsof clouds, like unto two huge bulls fighting for a cow, twoagitated oceans, two moving mountains, two effulgentAdityas, two burning flames, two proud elephants, twoproud lions and like the very Rudra and Kāla. As themountains suffer many clappings of thunder-bolts so didthey bear many strokes. And all the quarters wereresounded with the sound proceeding from the stroke oftheir clubs like unto the sound of thunder-bolts. Beingplaced against the breast of Rāvana Arjuna's club rendered,for a moment, the welkin look like the burning gold as does thelightning. And striking again and again against Arjuna's breastRāvana's club looked like a huge fire-brand. Arjuna wasnot worn out nor was Rāvana. And the conflict went onbetween them like the encounter between Bala andVasava in the days of yore. The King of men and theKing of Rakshasas assailed and wounded one anotherwith their clubs like unto two bulls striking oneanother with their horns and two elephants with theirtusks. Thereupon worked up with rage, Arjuna, withhis full might, smote Rāvana on his breast, with his club.But Rāvana was well protected by the boon of thecelestial, so the club fell on earth sundered into twopieces like one hurled by a weak wight. Still wounded bythe mace of Arjuna, Rāvana, shedding tears, ran away at adistance of four feet and sat there. Beholding Rāvanathus over-whelmed Arjuna sprang up and caught himlike Garuda holding a serpent and Vishnu binding Bali.Daçagriva being thus bound, the Siddhas, Charanas andthe celestials exclaiming 'Well done! Well done!!'showered flowers upon Arjuna. And the king emitted leonineroars again and again as a tiger joyous roars like acloud, holding a deer under his grasp. Regaining his senseand beholding Rāvana bound, Prahasta, in great anger,pursued the King of Haihayas. And the Rakshasa forcegrew tempestuous like unto the rising of the ocean duringrains. Thereupon exclaiming repeatedly 'Leave him off!Leave him off!! Wait! Wait!!' The Rākshasa host hurledhundreds of Musalas and darts in the battle-field. Not theleast moved thereby the king Arjuna, the slayer of enemies,bore those weapons of the enemies of the celestials.Thereupon baffling the weapons of the Rākshasas by means ofmany a dreadful and excellent one, Arjuna, the king ofHaihayas, drove them away like winds scattering the clouds.Having thus struck terror unto the night-rangers, he, encircledby his own kinsmen, repaired to his own city with Rāvana,carrying him bound like unto Indra carrying Bali bound.Thereupon flowers and fried paddy were showered upon himby the Brāhmanas and citizens.\""

  "Uttara Kānda": "\"Thereupon Pulastya heard from the celestials of thecapture of Rāvana like unto the holding of the wind.95 Andhaving been moved by the love for his son, the highlyeffulgent, great ascetic, proceeded to see the king of Mahishmati.Proceeding by the aerial way, that twice-born one, giftedwith the velocity of wind and the flight of mind, reached thecity of Mahishmati. Like unto Brahmā entering Indra'sAmaravati, he entered the city resembling the capital ofIndra and filled with delighted and plump citizens. Andbeholding that dreadful Rishi approach like unto Adityāwalking on foot, the warders communicated the intelligenceunto the king Arjuna. Understanding from their words thatPulastya was coming, the king of Haihayas, placing hisfolded palms on his crown, proceeded to welcome him. Like,unto Vrihaspati preceeding Purandara, the royal priests wentbefore him carrying Maduparka and water to wash feet. Andbeholding the ascetic resembling the rising sun arrived, theking Arjuna bowed unto him reverentially like Indra salutingMahideva. Thereupon offering him Maduparka, cow andwater to wash feet, the king of Haihayas in accentsobstructed with delight, addressed the asceticsaying:—'Reverend Sir, thine visit, it is hard to obtain. Onbeholding thee my city Mahishmati hath been turned into Amaravati.To-day have I obtained all auspiciousness, O lord; to-day hathmy religious observance been fruitful; to-day hath my birthproved blessed and to-day hath my devout penance beencrowned with success, for I bow unto thy feet, which havebeen worshipped by the celestials. This my kingdom, thesemy sons, this my wife and myself are all at thydisposal—do thou order me, O Brahman, what I may do for thee.'Thereupon having enquired of the king about his piety,offerings and the well-being of his sons, Pulastya said toArjuna, the king of Haihayas:—'O foremost of kings, Othou having eyes like lotus-petals! O thou having acountenance like the full moon! When thou hast vanquishedRāvana, thy prowess is matchless in the triple world. Thouhast bound up my invincible son in the conflict at whose fearthe wind and the ocean stand still. Having drunk up theglories of my son thou hast announced thine own; so I dosay, O my son, do thou release Daçānana.' Hearing thiscommand of Pulastya, the king Arjuna did not utter a singleword and set, most delightedly the king of Rākshasas, free.Having released that foe of the celestials, worshipped him withcelestial ornaments and garlands and established friendshipremoving all enmities with Rāvana before fire, andbowed unto Pulastya, the son of Brahmā, he repaired to hisown house. And being released by the influence of Pulastya,the highly powerful Daçānana, the king of Rākshasas,accepted his hospitality and being embraced by him,returned home ashamed. And having set Daçagriva at libertyPulastya, the son of Brahmā and the foremost of Munisrepaired to the celestial region. O Rāma, in this wise, thehighly powerful Rāvana was defeated by Arjuna andreleased by Pulastya. Observe therefore, O descendant of Raghu,there is a mightier man than the mighty; therefore, one,desirous of his own well-being, should not disregard another.Having acquired friendship with the thousand-armed Arjuna,Dacānana, the king of Rākshasas, began again to journey overthe world distressing the kings.\""

  "Uttara Kānda": "\"Released by Arjuna, and yet not conceiving any shame,Rāvana, the king of Rākshasas again began to traverse theearth. Rākshasas or men, of whom the proud Rāvana heardto be powerful he used to approach and summon themfor fight. After some time he arrived at the city ofKishkindhā reared by Vāli and invited him, wearing goldengarland, to fight. Thereat, Tāra, her father Sushenaand the Prince Sugriva said to the king ofRākshasas—'O lord of Rākshasas, he is not present here,who shall be able to withstand thee. What monkey elseis capable of standing before thee? However, O Rāvana, Vālishall soon return after performing the Sandhyā rites at theconfluence of the four oceans; therefore wait here for amoment. Behold, O Daçānana, there lie the bones of allthose, like conch, who came ere this to fight with thepowerful king of monkeys. O Rāvana, O Rākshasa, even if thouhast drunk nectar, thou shalt at this very moment loose thylife, when the encounter with Vāli shall take place. OVaisravana, do thou observe the variegated universenow—wait for a moment after which it will be hard for thee tokeep thy life. Or if thou dost wish to meet with death dothou speedily repair to the southern ocean and thou shaltbehold there Vāli like unto fire placed on earth.' Hearingthose words, Rāvana, the aggrandiser of the triple world,remonstrated with Tārā and ascending his flowery car wentto the southern ocean and espied Vāli, having redcountenance like the rising sun, engaged in Sandhyā rites withwhole-mindedness. Thereupon having descended from hisPushpaka car he with silent steps approached Vāli to bringhim under his grasp. Casting his looks at pleasure, Vāli sawhim. Albeit apprised of his evil intention, he was not theleast moved. And he did not care for him as a lion is notmoved on beholding a hare and Garuda on beholdinga serpent. He then thought within himself—'Thisvicious-souled Rāvana is approaching to catch me; holding himunder my arm pit I shall journey over the three great oceans.Everyone will behold the enemy Rāvana, under my arm pitas a serpent possessed by Garuda, with his thighs, arms andclothes loosened.' Having thought thus Vāli remained silentfor sometime and reciting incantations he waited there likea mountain. Thereupon the king of monkeys and thelord of Rakshasas, proud of strength, essayed to catch oneanother. Vāli was seated with his back (towards Rāvana);still from his footsteps he perceived that he had come withinthe grasp of Rāvana’s army and he at once caught hold ofhim like unto Garuda holding a serpent. Getting hold ofRāvana, the lord of Rākshasas, desirous of catching him,(Vāli) and placing him under his arm-pit Vāli vehementlyrose high up in the welkin. And he went away carryinghim, scratching him again and again with his nails likeunto winds scattering clouds. The Ten-necked demon beingthus carried away, his councillors, to release him, pursued,exclaiming, Vāli, in the welkin. They thus following him, Vāli,appeared in the sky like the sun in the midst of clouds. TheRākshasas could not catch Vāli but were rather exhaustedby the stroke of his arms and thighs. What to speak ofanimals made of flesh and blood anxious for their lives eventhe mountains make way when Vāli goes. Rising high upinto the sky where even the birds cannot reach, Vāli, thelord of monkeys and gifted with great velocity, by and byfinished his Sandhyā rites above the oceans. Beingworshipped by the aerials their lord, with Rāvana, firstproceeded to the western ocean. And having finishedthere Sandhyā prayers and recited incantations he, withDaçānana, went to the northern ocean. And havingjourneyed over many thousand leagues that huge monkey,with his enemy, finished his prayers there and then proceededto the eastern ocean. And having recited his prayers therealso, Vāli, the son of Indra, and the king of monkeys,carrying Rāvana, returned to the city of Kishkindhā. Havinggone through his Sandhyā rites at the four oceans andcarrying Rāvana, that monkey-chief was greatly exhaustedand (therefore) descended into the gardens of Kishkindhā.Having got out Rāvana from his arm-pit, the foremost ofmonkeys, laughing again and again said:—'Whence artthou coming?' Thereupon being surprised greatly,Daçānana, the king of Rākshasas, with eyes shaking withexhaustion, said to the king of monkeys:—'O king ofmonkeys, resembling Mahendra, I am Rāvana, the king ofRākshasas; I came here to fight: but I have been defeatedby thee. Alas! What strength is thine! what prowess!! Whatgravity!!! Holding me like a beast thou hast journeyed overthe four oceans. O hero! What heroic wight is there whois not exhausted by carrying me so vehemently? O monkey,mind, wind and Garuda—these three are gifted with thevelocity. Undoubtedly thou hast got the same velocity.Thy prowess hath been sufficiently displayed. But nowI wish, O king of monkeys, to make friends with thee for everbefore fire. O king of monkeys, from to-day, wife, sons,city, kingdom, enjoyment, cloth and food shall be ourcommon.' Thereupon having lighted up fire the king ofmonkeys and the king of Rakshasas, embracing each other,became friends. Thereupon holding each other by thearms they entered the city of Kishkindhā like unto two lions,entering delightedly a cave. There like Sugriva Rāvanaspent a month. Afterwards his councillors, desirous ofdestroying the triple world, took him away. O lord Rāma, Ihave thus related to thee the previous history. Havingthus belaboured Rāvana Vāli at last made friends withbefore fire. O Rāma, Vāli had unequalled and great strength,Like unto fire burning down locusts thou didst burn downVāli.\""

  "Uttara Kānda": "Thereupon Rāma, being stricken with curiosity, withfolded palms and humbly accosted Agastya, residing in thesouthern quarter, with pregnant accents, saying;—\"Thousayest that Rāvana and Vāli had unequalled strength butmethinks theirs can not equal that of Hanumān. Heroism,liberality, strength, patience, intellect, knowledge of lawsand means, prowess and energy all exist together inHanumān. When the monkey host lost heart on beholding theocean, Hanumān, consoling crossed over the deep extendingover a hundred leagues. Having desecrated the presidinggoddess of Lankā and on beholding Sitā there, he consoledher. What to speak of more, Hanumān, single-handed,slew Rāvana’s commander-in-chief, the minister's son, hisservants and his one son. Being released from the Brahmaweapon Hanumān remonstrated with Rāvana, and reducedLankā into ashes like unto fire burning down earth. What Ihave seen myself performed by Hanumān in the conflict isabove the power of Kāla, Vāsava and even the lord of riches.It is by the strength of the arms of that Wind-god's son I haveobtained Lankā, Sitā, Lakshrnana, Victory, kingdom andmy friends. What more, had not Hanumān, the friend ofthe king of monkeys—Sugriva, been in my company whocould have brought Sitā's intelligence? Why did not Hanumān,although wishing welfare unto Sugriva, reduce Vāli to ashes likeso many creepers on the occasion of his quarrel with Sugriva?Methinks, Hanumān was not cognisant of his own prowessthen? And therefore he did stoop to witness the miseriesof Sugriva—the king of monkeys who was dearer than hislife. O thou worshipped of the immortals, do thou trulydescribe unto me this action of Hanumān.\" Hearing thosewell-meaning words of Rāghava, the ascetic Agastya said tohim in the presence of Hanumān. \"O foremost of Raghus,what thou hast said regarding Hanumān is all true. Asregards, strength, velocity and intellect there is none whocan equal Hanumān. O represser of enemies, in the days ofyore Hanumān was imprecated by the ascetics, whose cursesnever become fruitless, to the effect that he would never beconscious of his whole strength. I am not capable of describingto thee the wondrous childish feat which Hanumān didperform in his boyhood. But if thou art, O Rāghava, greatlyanxious to hear it, I shall relate—do thou hear with a quiescentmind. Hanumān's father Keshari reigned in the mountainSumeru which resembles gold by the influence of the sun.Keshari had a well-known wife by the name of Anjanā to whomhe was greatly attached. The deity Wind begot on Anjanā anexcellent son. Repairing to a dense forest for collectingfruits, the excellent damsel gave birth to Hanumānresembling the tip of a Sāla tree and went away. Being distressedwith hunger on account of the absence of the mother,Hanumān, just born, cried like Kartikeya, thecommander-in-chief of the celestials, in the forest of Saras. At this timethe sun resembling Yavā flowers, having risen, Hanumān,to get a fruit, sprang up. Being desirous of holding thenewly risen sun, Hanumān, resembling it, began to leap inthe middle of the welkin. The child Hanumān having thusascended the sky, celestials, Dānavas and Yakshassurprisingly exclaimed 'The velocity, with which Marut's son is going,is not possessed even by the Wind, Garuda and mind. If hehas got such vehemence in his boyhood what great strengthhe shall have in his youth.' His own son thus leaping, thewind, becoming cool by the touch of snow, began to followhim proceeding in the sky lest the rays of the sun mightscorch him. Rising high up in the sky on account of childishfreaks and traversed many thousand leagues by the help ofhis father Hanumān neared the sun. Considering that hewas a mere child and therefore not tarnished by any sin andthat a great divine work would be accomplished by him infuture the sun did not burn Hanumān. At the every daywhen Hanumān sprang up to hold the sun, Rahu too essayedto possess him. Having reached the top of the sun's carHanumān touched Rahu; so he, the represser of the moon'srays, accordingly went back on beholding the sun thuspossessed. And repairing to the house of Indra, Sinhika'sson, in wrath and with frowns, said to him encircled by thecelestials:—'O Vasava! O slayer of Bala and Vitra—toremove my hunger thou didst give me both the sun and moon;why thou hast then given them to another? On accountof the Parva I came to devour the sun but another Rahucame and possessed him.' Hearing the words of Rahu,the King of the deities, wearing a golden garland, havinghis understanding bewildered, proceeded, on the back ofhis elephant-chief Airavat, huge like the summit of theKailasa hill, with temporal juice always trickling, havingfour tusks, roaring, and adorned with golden bells, towardsHanumān and the sun with Rahu before him. Having leftbehind Indra, Rahu quickly went there but fled away onbeholding the huge-bodied Hanumān resembling a mountainsummit. Thereupon leaving aside the sun and being desirousof holding Rāhu, the son of Sinhikā considering him as afruit, Hanumān again sprang up into the sky. BeholdingHanumān approach renouncing the sun, Rahu with hiscountenance only visible, desisted and went back. Andconsidering Indra as the saviour he again and again criedaloud 'Indra! Indra!!' Understanding everything by thepiteous accents of Rahu Indra said, 'No fear, I shall soonslay him.' Thereupon beholding the huge-bodied Airavat andconsidering him as a bigger fruit Māruti ran towards him.Proceeding thus tempestuously when he rose above the headof Indra, Hanumān, looked in a moment dreadful like the fireof dissolution. But not greatly enraged the thousand-eyedlord of Sachi, with the thunder-bolt in his hand, struck therunning Hanumān. Belaboured by the thunder-bolt of IndraHanumān fell down and broke his left jaw. He being thusoverwhelmed by the stroke of Indra's thunder-bolt, theWind-god became displeased with the king of celestials andwas determined upon bringing about mischief unto all createdbeings. The all-comprehending wind, not spreadinghimself, entered into a cave with his son. Like unto Vāsavadistressing all creatures by putting a stop to the showers,the wind too put all animals into unbearable suffering byobstructing all execrations. On account of the anger of theWind-god their breath was completely obstructed, and thejoints—as if pierced, became hard as wood. SādhyaVasatkār and all the religious observances of the triple worldwere put a stop to by the anger of the Wind-god. So thethree worlds appeared as if stricken with sorrow. Thereuponthe afflicted celestials, Gandharvas, Asuras and men repairedto the Patriarch Brahmā with a view to bring about thewell-being of created beings. And with their bellies swollenfor the obstruction of the wind the celestials with foldedhands said:—'O lord of created beings, thou hast createdfour classes of beings and thou hast given us wind to preserveour lives. But we do not know, why the wind, the lord ofour beings, is distressing us, by obstructing our movements likeunto females confined in an inner apartment. Being thusdistressed by the wind we have come to seek thy shelter,O thou the remover of miseries—do thou remove ourafflictions consequent upon the obstruction of the wind.' Hearingthose words of the created beings, their lord (the PatriarchBrahmā) again said 'Hear, why the wind, being enraged,has obstructed the course of all beings. Hearing the wordsof Rahu, Indra, the king of the celestials, hath belabouredthe Wind-god's son. It is for this that he hath been offended.Preserving the bodied, the wind, having no person, passesthrough them all. Without wind the body becomes likewood. Therefore the wind constitutes the life, the happinessand the whole universe. Renouncing the wind the worldcannot attain to happiness. Being cast off by the wind andhaving their breaths obstructed, behold, the world, to-dayappeareth like dried wood. Let us therefore go there wherethe wind, the giver of our afflictions, waiteth. If we do notplease the son of Aditi we shall all meet with destruction.'Thereupon the Patriarch Brahmā, the celestials, Gandharvas,serpents, Guhyakas and other created beings went where thewind was waiting with his own son belaboured by the king ofthe celestials. Thereupon beholding that boy, on the lap ofthe Wind-God, resembling gold and Baisvanar, the four-mouthedBrahmā, the celestials, Gandharvas, Rishis, Yakshas andRākshasas were all moved with pity.\""

However I am curious tolearn who was their mother, where was their residence, andhow they had been named so—do thou favour me withthe account.\" Rāma having said this Agastya said:—\"ORāma, I shall relate to thee everything in short of whatI had heard from Nārada when he came to my hermitage.Once on a time whilst travelling that highly pious asceticarrived at my hermitage; I duly worshipped and welcomedhim; and when I asked him out of curiosity, he, seated atpleasure, said:—'Hear, O great ascetic, the foremost ofthe pious; there is a mountain named Meru, highlypicturesque, made of gold and greatly charming. The middlepeak is much liked by the celestials, on which is situate thebeautiful assemblage hall of Brahmā extending over a hundredleagues. The four-mouthed deity, sprung from lotus, alwaysresideth there. And from his eyes while going through theYoga practices tears trickled down. No sooner the PatriarchBrahmā, with his hands, wiped them off into the groundthan a monkey originated from those tears. O foremost ofmen, as soon as that monkey was produced, the high-souledBrahmā consoled him in sweet accents and said—\"Do thouproceed to that leading mountain where the celestialsperpetually reside. O foremost of monkeys, living uponmany a fruit and root in that picturesque mountain thoushouldst always live by me. And while thou shall live inthis wise for some time thou shalt be crowned withauspiciousness.\" Brahmā having said this, O Rāghava, the foremostof monkeys saluted that god of gods, placing his head at hisfeet and said to that Primaeval deity, the creator of beingsand the lord of the universe. \"O god, thou art placing meunder thy behests—verily I shall follow them.\" Having saidthis to Patriarch that monkey immediately went to a forestabounding in fruits and flowers. There living on fruits andcollecting honey and various flowers, he, every day, usedto come to Brahmā in the evening. O Rāma, in thiswise he used to make an offering of excellent fruits andflowers at the feet of Brahmā, the god of gods. Journeyingin this way over the mountain he spent many long years.Some time having elapsed in this way, O Rāghava, Riksharaja,the foremost of monkeys, being distressed with thirst, repairedto the excellent mountain Meru. There is a pond of purewater, resonant with the notes of various birds. Havingshaken his manes with a delighted heart, Riksharaja saw hisreflection in the waters. Beholding his own image therethat monkey-chief, stricken with anger and anxietythought—\"What arch-enemy of mine is living in the waters?I shall destroy the excellent abode of the vicious-souled one.\"Thinking thus within himself, that monkey, out of fickleness,jumped down into the lake. And he again sprang uptherefrom. And at the time of rising, O Rāma, that leadingmonkey found himself metamorphosed into a female form,which was highly charming, graceful and beautiful. Herwaist was spacious, eye-brows beautiful and hairs were blackand curling; her countenance was beautiful and smiling,breast high and beauty matchless. And there appearedcharming on the banks of the lake, lighting up all quarters thatfemale, agitating the mind of all, and beautiful in the tripleworld like unto simple Sastilatā, Ramā, without lotus, purerays of the moon, Parvati more beautiful than even Lakshmi.At this time was returning by that way, Indra, the leader ofthe celestials after having worshipped the feet of Brahmā.And the sun too journeying arrived there. They bothsimultaneously espied that female form and were possessedby desire. What more, their whole body, as soon as theysaw her, was moved and the firmness of the mind shaken.Thereupon Indra begot on her a son named Vāli for heoriginated from her hairs and the sun begot on her anotherson, who was named Sugriva for he originated from her neck.Thus the two highly powerful monkeys being born, Indra wentback to his region having conferred upon Vāli an un-endinggarland of gold. And having engaged Hanumān, theWind-god's son in the service of Sugriva, the sun too went back tothe sky. O king, the sun having risen after, that nightRiksharaja again obtained his own real monkey shape.Having thus regained his monkey form he made his twohighly powerful sons,—leading monkeys, assuming shapes atwill and having tawny eyes, drink honey, like nectar.Thereupon taking them, he came to the abode of Brahmā.Beholding his son Riksharaja with his sons, Brahmā, thegrand-father of the celestials, consoled him in diverse ways.Then he ordered the celestial messenger saying—\"At mybehest, O emissary, do thou proceed to the highly picturesquecity of Kishkindhā. That golden, big and charming city isworthy of Riksharajā. There live many thousand monkeysbesides others assuming shapes at will. It abounds in variousjewels, invincible, is inhabited by four Varnas, holy andsacred. At my command Visvvakarmā has constructed thecelestial and picturesque city of Kishkindhā. Do thou placethere Riksharāja, the foremost of monkeys, with his sons;and having invited the leading monkeys and others andreceived them courteously do thou install him on the throne.On beholding this monkey-chief, gifted with intelligence theyshall be all subject to him.\" Brahmā, having said this, thecelestial emissary, with Riksharāja before him, proceeded tothe highly picturesque city of Kishkindhā. And havingentered there with the velocity of the wind, he, at thecommand of the Patriarch, crowned the leading monkeyRiksharāja as king. And being sprinkled according to theceremonies of installation, and adorned with a crown andvarious other ornaments he, with a delighted heart, engagedin governing the monkeys. All the monkeys, residing on earthconsisting of seven insular continents and bounded byocean, came under his subjection. Thus Riksharāja wasboth the father and mother of Vāli and Sugriva. May goodbetide thee. The learned who listen to and make othershear this story, conducing to the enhancement of theirdelight, get all their desires and objects accomplished. Ihave duty described to thee at length all events and haverecounted the stories relating to the birth of the Kings ofmonkeys and Rākahsasas.'\""

  "Uttara Kānda": "Hearing this excellent Paurānic theme in the companyof his brothers, Rāghava was greatly surprised. Thereuponhearing the words of the Rishi he said:—\"By thy favour I havelistened to the highly sacred theme. O foremost of Munis.I was greatly worked up with curiosity in this matter. I amnot the least surprised to learn, O twice-born one, that thosetwo sons of the celestials would be two highly powerful leadingmonkeys since their origin is divine.\" Rāma having said thisAgastya said:—\"O thou having long arms, thus in the daysof yore the birth of Vāli and Sugriva was brought about. Oking, I shall now again relate to thee another divine theme.O Rāma I shall now describe to thee why did Rāvana stealSitā. Do thou hear it attentively. O Rāma, in the goldenage, having bowed unto the Patriarch’s son, the truthful RishiSanatkumar, highly effulgent, resplendent like unto the sun,shining in his native brilliance and seated at his own place,Rāvana, the lord of Rākshasas, said:—'Who is now amongstthe celestials brave and powerful, by whose help thecelestials can vanquish their enemies and whom thetwice-born ones daily worship and the devotees meditate upon.O thou having piety for wealth, O thou gifted with six sortsof wealth, do thou describe this to me kindly.' Beingapprised of Rāvana's intention, the saint Sanatkumar, who sawevery thing through his devotion, said to him out oflove—'Hear my son. The learned duly, in their sacrifices,worship that Hari, respected of people and drinking nectar,who is the lord of the universe, whoso origin we do notknow, who is daily worshipped by the celestials and Asuras,who is highly powerful Nārāyana from whose navel has sprungBrahmā, the creator of the world, and who has created theuniverse consisting of mobile and immobile beings. TheYogis meditate upon him and celebrate sacrifices in hishonor according to the Purānas, Vedas, Pancharātra andother rituals. He always vanquisheth in encounter DaityasDanavas, Rakshasas and all other enemies of the celestialsand every one of them worships him.' Hearing thosewords of the great ascetic Sanatkumar, Rāvana, the lord ofRākshasas, bowing, replied:—'Being slain by Hari to whatstation do the Daityas, Danavas and Rākshasas attain? Andwhy doth Hari destroy them?' Whereto Sanatkumarreplied:—'Whoever are slain by the celestials do eternallyreside in their region. And being banished therefrom, theyagain take their birth on earth. Thus by the misery andhappiness acquired in their pristine existence, they gothrough births and deaths. O king, all the monarchs, slainby Janarddana, holding discus and the lord of the triple world,attained to his own region; even his anger becometh like aboon.' Hearing those words given vent to by the greatascetic Sanatkumar the night-ranger Rāvana, being workedup with delight and surprise, began to meditate how he shouldenter into conflict with Hari.\""

'O thou having longarms, what thou hast desired in thy mind shall beencompassed in the great encounter. Be thou happy and waitfor some time.' Hearing this the long-armed (Rāvana)again said to the ascetic—'Do thou tell me at length whatare his marks.' Hearing the words of the lord of Rākshasas,the ascetic replied:—'Hearken, I shall relate to thee everything, O foremost of Rākshasas. That great deity pervadethall, is minute, invisible ever-existing, and manifest over theuniverse consisting of mobile and immobile creations. Heis present in the celestial region, in the earth, in the regionunderneath the earth, on the mountains, in the forests, in allstationary objects, in all rivers and in all cities. He is Om,truth, Sābitri and earth. He is known as the deityDharādhara (holder of earth) and Ananta. He is day, night,morning and evening, Yama, the moon, Kāla, the wind,Brahmā, Rudra, Indra and water. He makes the worldmanifest and shine; he creates them, destroys them andgoverns them. He sporteth, is eternal, the lord of men,Vishnu, Purana and the only destroyer of the world. Whatis the use of speaking more, O Dasānana, He comprehendsthe three worlds, the mobile and immobile. Wearing ayellow raiment like unto the filaments of lotus, Nārāyana,resembling dark-blue lotus in colour, is resplendant like untoclouds in the welkin accompanied by lightning. Andcovering his person, Lakshmi, in the shape of warfare, liesstationed in his body like unto lightning in the clouds. Thecelestials, Asuras or Nāgas—none is capable of casting hislooks upon him. He alone can see him with whom he ispleased, O my son; neither by the fruits of sacrifices,asceticism, self-control, gifts, sacrifices, nor by anything else canone behold the Illustrious Deity. Those alone can seeHim, who have devoted themselves, their life and being, untoHim and who, by virtue of discriminative knowledge, havegot their sins burnt. If thou art willing to behold him, hear,if thou dost like, I shall describe everything at length. Atthe end of the golden age and the beginning of Tretā Yugathe deity Nārāyana shall assume a human form for thebenefit of men and celestials. A son by the name of Rāmashall be born unto Dasaratha, of the Ikshwāku race whoshall govern earth. Rāma shall be highly effulgent, highlypowerful and in patience like unto earth—and the enemiesin the encounter shall not be able to eye him as they cannotthe sun. In this wise the lord Nārāyana shall appear in ahuman form. At the behest of his sire, the pious and thehigh-minded Rāma shall sojourn in the forest of Dandakain the company of his brother. His spouse the graciousLakshmi, shall be celebrated under the appellation of Sitā.She will be born as the daughter of Janaka, the king of Mithilāand will come out of earth. In beauty she shall be matchless onearth and be gifted with auspicious marks and shall alwaysfollow Rāma like a shadow as the rays follow the moon. Shewill be graced with a good conduct, chaste and patient; andSitā and Rāma shall always appear together like the rays ofthe sun. Rāvana, I have thus related to you everything aboutthe Nārāyana, the great Brahman, eternal andincomprehensible.' O Rāghava, hearing those words, the highly powerfullord of Rākshasas began to concert plans for entering intoconflict with thee. Meditating again and again overSanatkumār's words and delighted he began to journey for battle.\"Hearing those words, Rāma, with his eyes expanded in surprise,was greatly wondered.

Whoever, amongst the Daityas, Dānavas andRākshasis was reported to him as being powerful he used toinvite for battle. O king of earth, having thus traversed thewhole world, the ten-necked demon saw the saint Nāradareturning to his own region from Brahmaloka. Like thesecond sun he was proceeding through the clouds. Rāvana,with a delighted heart, neared him and addressed the celestialsaint Nārada with folded palms, saying:—'O thou gifted withsix sorts of wealth, thou hast seen many a time all creationsfrom Brahmā down to an insect. Do thou tell me, O greatone, the inhabitants of which world are morepowerful? I wish to fight with them according to my desire.'Whereto, thinking for a moment, the celestial saint Nāradareplied:—'O king, there is an insular continent near themilky ocean. All the inhabitants that live there are giftedwith strength—effulgent like the rays of the moon,huge-bodied, highly powerful and have a voice deep as the mutteringof the clouds. They are all greatly beautiful, patient andhave huge arms. O king of Rākshasas, I have seen inSwetadwipa such powerful men, as thou dost want to seeon this earth.' Hearing the words of Nārada, Rāvanasaid:—'O celestial saint, why are the inhabitants of Swetadwipapowerful? And how did those high-souled ones come tolive there? O lord, do thou relate to me everything at length.Thou dost observe the whole universe like a myrobalamin thy palms.' Hearing the words of Rāvana, the celestialsaint said:—'O lord of Rākshasas, the inhabitants ofSwetadwipa are perpetually devoted unto Nārāyana withwhole-mindedness and earnestly worship Him. They havealways their hearts and minds devoted unto Him and are allhigh-souled. Having rendered their lives and souls untoNārāyana, they have been blessed with their abode inSwetadwipa. Those, who are slain in the encounter with his bowbent by Vishnu—the holder of discus and the preserver of theworld, attain to the celestial region. Neither by sacrifice,devout penance, self-control nor excellent gifts may beobtained the celestial region full of bliss.' Hearing thewords of Nārada, the Ten necked demon was worked upwith surprise and meditating for some time said 'I shallenter into conflict with him.' Thereupon inviting Nāradahe proceeded to Swetadwipa. Thinking for a long time andbeing curious to witness that wondrous encounter, Nāradaspeedily went there. He was ever fond of sport and warfare.Filling all the quarters with dreadful leonine roars Rāvana withall the Rākshasas moved towards the Swetadwipa. AfterNārada had reached there, the illustrious Daçānana went tothat insular continent beyond even the reach of the celestials.Being struck by the radiant heat of that insular continent,the Puspaka car, of the mighty Rāvana, could not stand therelike clouds scattered by the wind. Having arrived at thatdreadful insular continent the councillors of the lord ofRākshasas, fearfully said to Rāvana. 'O lord, we are allstupified and beside ourselves with fear. We cannotanyhow stand here; how shall we fight?' Saying this theRākshasas fled away into all directions. And Daçānana toosent away his golden car Pushpaka with them. Having thussent away his chariot and assuming a dreadful figure he aloneentered Swetadwipa. At the time of his entering he wasseen by the females there. One of them holding him by thehand and smiling said 'Why hast thou come hither? Whoart thou? Who is thy father? and what for hast thou come here?Do thou definitely say.' Hearing those words, O king,Rāvana, in anger said:—'I am the son of the ascetic Visrava,I am Rāvana by name; I have come hither being desirousof fighting; but I do not behold anyone here.' Thevicious-souled Rāvana having said this all the young damsels laughedgently. But one of them, being enraged, took up Rāvana,like a child, as if in sport and hurled him amongst hercompanions. And addressing another she said:—'Behold,I have caught this black Rāvana, having twenty arms andten faces, like a small insect.' Thereupon Rāvana, beingworn out with hurling, passed from one one hand to another.Being thus hurled the learned and powerful Rāvana, in anger,severely bit the palms of that fair one. Being overwhelmedwith pain that damsel let him off. Thereupon, another,taking that Rākshasa-chief, rose up in the welkin. Rāvana,again waxing wroth tore her with his nails. And beingleft off by that damsel, the terrified night-ranger fell downinto the waters of the deep. The females, inhabiting thatinsular continent again and again in this wise hurled Rāvana.Beholding him thus distressed the highly effulgent Nāradadanced in joy and surprise. O thou having long arms, beingapprised of this, the vicious-souled Rāvana stole away Sitāwith a view to meet death at thy hands. Thou art Nārāyana,holding discus, conch and club; thou hast in thy hands thebow, a lotus, thunder-bolt and other weapons; thou artworshipped of all deities; thou art graced with the mysticmark Sribatsa, adored by all celestials, hast a lotus navel,art a great ascetic, and Hrishikesha declaring fearlessnessunto all devotees. Thou hast assumed a human form to bringabout the destruction of Rāvana. Dost thou not recognisethyself as Nārāyana? O great one, do not forget thyself;do thou recollect thy real self. The Patriarch Brahmā saidthat thou art subtler than the subtle. Thou art the the threequalities, the three Vedas and the regions—that of thecelestials, of the mortals and the region under the earth.Thy work is manifest in time, past, present and future; thouart the observer of three Vedas and the destroyer of theenemies of the celestials. With thy three steps, thou didst,in the days of yore, traverse the three worlds. Thou wertborn of Aditi, as the youngest brother of Indra for bindingBali. Thou art the eternal Vishnu. To extend thy favoursunto humanity thou hast been born as man. O foremost ofthe celestials, the work of the deities hath beenaccomplished. The vicious Rāvana, with his sons and relatives,hath been slain. The Rishis, having piety for their wealthand all the deities have been pleased. O foremost ofgods—all this hath been brought about by thy favours;and the whole universe hath been pacified. Sitā is the verypersonation of Lakshmi, sprung from earth. It is for theethat she hath been born in the race of Janaka. Bringingher into Lankā Rāvana protected her with care like hismother. Rāma, I have thus related to thee the entirestory. Hearing this from the Rishi Sanatkumar, thelong-lived Nārada described this unto me. Daçānana, to aletter I followed the instructions of Sanatkumar. Who everlistens to this story at the time of Sraddha, the rice, offeredby him, becoming inexhaustible, reaches his manes.\"Hearing this celestial theme, the lotus-eyed Rāma along withhis brothers was greatly surprised. And having their eyesexpanded with delight the monkeys, with Sugriva, theRākshasas with Bibhishana, the kings with their councillors,and all other assembled pious Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas,and Sudras, delightedly espied Rāma. Thereupon the highlyeffulgent Agastya said to Rāma:—\"O Rāma, we have allseen thee and been honoured; now we shall depart.\"Saying this, they, being honored, repaired to their respectivehabitations. The sun set, Rāma, the foremost of men, gavefarewell to monkeys and their king and duly went through theSandhya rite. Gradually night set in and he entered theinner appartment."

The jewels collected for me, I do conferupon my two daughters.\" The royal saint Janaka havinggone away, Rāma, with folded hands and humbly said to hismaternal uncle Kaikeya—\"O king, this kingdom, myself, Bharatand Lakshmana are all at thy disposal.

O thou having long arms, always looktowards Angada, with loving eyes. Do thou, O Sugriva,protect lovingly the highly powerful Hanumān, Nala, thyfather-in-law Sushena, the mighty Tāra, irrepressible Kumada,the powerful Neela, the heroic Satabali, Mainda, Dwivida,Gaya, Gavaksha, Gavaya, Sarava, the irrepressible andpowerful king of bears Jamvaban, Gandhamādana, valiantRishava, Supatala, Keshan, Sarabha and Sumbha—theseand other heroic monkeys who dedicated their lives to myservice. Do thou never act to their displeasure.\" Havingsaid this and embraced Sugriva again and again Rāmaaddressed Bibhishana with sweet accents. \"I know thouart cognizant of piety; the citizens, thy councillors andthy brother Kuvera also love thee; do thou thereforego and govern Lankā piously, O king; never cherishany vile intention; the honest kings always enjoythe earth. And my only request to thee, O king, isthat thou mayst with love remember me and Sugriva.

May mylife remain in my body as long as the stories of Rāma shallbe in currency on earth.

O hero, as the windsscatter the clouds so I shall remove my anxiety by listeningto thy nectar-like themes.\" After Hanumān had said this,Rāma rose up from his throne and having embracedHanumān affectionately said, \"O foremost of monkeys, what thouhast said, shall undoubtedly be carried out into action. Aslong as my stories shall be current on earth thy fame shallexist and life shall be in thy body. And as long as the worldshall exist my themes shall be related. I cannot, even atthe sacrifice of my life, release myself from the debts of onegood service out of the many, thou hast done for me,monkey; and I shall for ever remain indebted to thee forthy last benefaction. Or let them wear out in me, for men,at the time of danger, become worthy of having their benefitsreturned.\" Having said this, Rāma took off from hisneck a chain set with sapphires brilliant as the rays ofthe moon and placed it round the neck of Hanumān.Like unto the mountain Sumeru beautified by the rising ofthe moon on its summit, Hanumān, the foremost of monkeys,appeared graceful with the chain placed on his breast. Andhearing the words of Rāghava, the highly powerful monkeys,one by one, saluted Rāma, touching his feet and went away.Both Sugriva and the virtuous-souled Bibhishana embracedRāma and three of them were beside themselves with tears.And other monkeys and Rākshasas were all moved withtears and sorrow to take leave of Rāma. Having receivedfavours thus from the high-souled Rāghava the monkeyswent away to their own houses like-unto bodied creaturesleaving off their bodies. Thereupon the Rākshasas, bears,monkeys, having bowed unto Rāma, the glory of the Raghufamily and with their eyes full of tears consequent upon hisseparation, went away to the countries from which they hadhailed."

And be not obstructed in thycourse whilst traversing all the quarters.\" Having beenadored by Rāma and saving 'So be it' Pushpaka proceededtowards its wished-for direction.

During all these monthssince thy installation subjects have not suffered from anydisease. Even the most aged animals have not met withdeath.

There were many a tree, having profuse foliageand flowers and covered with maddened black bees as ifconstructed by architects. The forest-land was variegatedand beautified by cuckoos, the ornaments of mangoe trees,black-bees and various birds of various colours. Amongstthe trees beautifying the forest some were gold-hued, somewere radiant as the flame of fire and some were like redcollyrium. There were various flowers, spreading fragranceand making garlands. And there were various ponds filledwith pure water. The stairs of those ponds were made ofcorals and the ground was of crystal. And they were allfilled with lotuses and lilies. They were beautified withChakrabakas and the banks were graced with variegatedtrees and flowers. And the forest was encompassed bystone walls and in the inside were dwelling many a Sārdulabird resembling Vaiduryas. All the trees in the forest werefilled with flowers. And the rocks there, covered with flowersfalling down from trees, appeared like welkin beautifiedwith stars. And Rāma's Asoka forest was like untoIndra's Nandana and Kuvera's Chitraratha made by Brahmā.Having entered the rich Asoka forest abounding in manyseats and houses and creepers Rāma sat on an excellentseat, covered with a beautiful coverlet and well constructed.Like unto Purandara with Sachi he took Sitā by the hand,made her sit and drink the wine distilled in the provinceof Mira. And in no time the servants brought for himwell-cooked meat and various fruits. Being inebriete thebeautiful Apsarās, well-skilled in the art of singing anddancing, began to dance before Rāma in the company ofKinnaris. The virtuous-souled Rāma, the foremost of thosewho know how to please, satisfied those beautiful damselsadorned with various ornaments. And Sitā sitting by him,he appeared like the effulgent Vasishtha in the company ofArundhati. Being greatly delighted the celestial-like Rāmapleased every day Sitā resembling a celestial damsel. Sitāand Rāghava thus spent their days happily. And thus wasspent the delightful winter giving all enjoyments. Enjoyingvarious things the high-souled Rāma and Sitā spent tenthousand years. Once on a time, having performed all thereligious ceremonies, in the fore part of the day, Rāma, tospend the evening, entered the inner apartment. Sitā, too,having performed all religious ceremonies, at first attendedto the service of her mothers-in-law. Thereupon wearinga beautifully coloured cloth and being adorned with variousornaments Sitā appeared before Rāma like unto Sachiapproaching the king of celestials in heaven. And beholdingthe auspicious signs of pregnancy in his spouse Rāmaattained to excessive delight. Thereupon he said to thebeautiful Sitā resembling a celestial damsel:—\"OVaidehi—signs of pregnancy are manifest in thee.What desires of thine can we satisfy?\" Smilinga little the daughter of Janaka said:—\"O Rāghava, I wishto behold the holy hermitages. I wish to salute thegreatly effulgent Rishis living on fruits and roots andresiding on the banks of the Ganges. I greatly desire, ORāma, that I may spend even one night in the hermitage ofthe Rishis living on fruits and roots.\" Whereto repliedRāma of unwearied actions, saying \"So be it.

Havingdiscomfitted Rāvana, in the encounter Rāma hath releasedSitā, but not being the least enraged on account of herbeing touched by Rāvana he hath brought her to hisown city. Rāvana did forcibly place Sitā on his lap;how can then Rāma enjoy delight in her company?Having taken her to the city of Lankā, Rāvana did keepher in the Asoka forest and Sitā was brought under thecontrol of Rākshashes. Still Rāma hath not been workedup with hatred by Sitā. From now we shall also brookethe bad conduct of our wives—for the subjects alwaystread the footsteps of their King. O King, the subjectsthus talk of many things in cities and provinces.\"Hearing those words of Vadra, Rāghava was greatly sorryand asked his friends saying \"Do the subjects thus talkabout me?\" Thereupon lowering their heads and salutinghim they all said to Rāghava, of a depressedmind—\"For sooth, the subjects thus talk about.\" ThereuponKākutstha, the slayer of enemies, hearing all those words,dismissed his friends."

I have been pierced to the veryvitals by those accusations. I have been born in the illustriousfamily of the high-souled Ikshwākus. Sitā hath been bornalso in the holy family of the great Janaka; gentle Lakshmana,thou knowest how in the solitary forest of Dandaka, Sitāwas stolen away by Rāvana and how have I slain him. Atthat time even I was stricken with anxiety regarding Sitāthat how I could take her home since she had resided in thehouse of the Rākshasas. To secure my confidence, Sitā,in your very presence, entered fire. At that time, O Saumitri,fire, carrying sacrificial oblations and the wind of the skydeclared Sitā's innocence before the celestials. In thepresence of all the Rishis and gods, the Sun and Moonannounced the innocence of the daughter of Janaka. Indra,the king of the celestials, himself handed over the chasteSitā unto me in the island of Lankā. My mind knowethSitā as chaste for ever. So, at that time I came back toAyodhyā with Sitā. But now a great sorrow consequentupon the censure of the citizens and villagers hath piercedmy heart. He, who is notorious on this earth and aslong as that notoriety remains current, is classed amongstthe vile. Even the celestials speak ill of badname—whereas fame is adored in all the regions.Therefore the high-souled exert their best to acquire reputation.O foremost of men, what to speak of the daughter ofJanaka—I can even renounce my life and yourselves infear of a bad name. Do ye therefore perceive into whatgreat abyss of sorrow and ill-fame I have fallen. Up tothis time I have never experienced such a mighty grief.Do thou, O Lakshmana, next morning, ascending the cardriven by Sumantra, take away Sitā to another country.There is a picturesque hermitage of the high-souledVālmiki situate on the Tamasā on the Other side of theriver Ganges. Do thou, O delight of Raghus, soon comeback, leaving behind Sitā in that lovely place; Do thoucarry out my words. Do thou not speak anything regardingSitā's banishment, O Saumitri, if dost thou request meto desist from this, it shall be the more unpleasant untome. For my life and arms, do ye not proffer any requestunto me regarding this, If so, you shall only endangermy well-being and I shall ever regard you as my enemies.If you obey my behests, do ye honor my words now.Do ye take away Sitā from here. Ere this Sitā hadcommunicated her intention of beholding the hermitagesof ascetics on the banks of the Ganges. Let that desireof hers be now satisfied.\" While saying this, the eyes ofthe virtuous-souled Rāma were covered with tears.Sighing hard like unto an elephant, he, with a heart strickenwith grief, departed to his own quarter in the company ofhis brothers."

Do thou soon bring the chariot here.\" Obeying themandate, and bringing a beautiful and holy car drawn byfirst-rate steeds and having excellent seats, he said to Saumitri, theenhancer of friends’ honor \"O lord, here is the chariotready—do thou now satisfy thine desire.\" Hearing the words ofSumantra, Lakshmana, the foremost of men, approached Sitāin the inner apartment and said:—\"O queen, thou didstrequest the king to show thee the hermitage—the king toodid promise—he hath now commanded me to take theethere. Do thou therefore follow me, at the command of theking. I shall, at his behest, take thee to the forest wheredwell many an ascetic.\" Hearing the words of thehigh-souled Lakshmana, Jānaki attained to excessive delight andbecame anxious to go.

My right eye and body are trembling.My mind is growing depressed. It is stricken withanxiety and I have accordingly grown restless. I beholdthe earth as void of all happiness.

Hearing thisLakshmana bowed unto her touching the ground with hiscrown, and though greatly sorry, said as if delighted \"Allwell.\" Thereupon having arrived at the hermitage situate onthe banks of Gomati Lakshmana spent the night there.Thereupon at dawn he rose up and asked the charioteer to getthe chariot ready, saying, \"Like unto the powerful Mahādevawe shall hold the waters of the Bhāgirathi on our head.\"Thereupon Sumantra yoked the horses, gifted with the fleet courseof the mind, to the chariot and with folded hands said toSitā. \"Do thou ascend the car.\" According to the request ofthe intelligent charioteer, Sitā, with Lakshmana, ascended thatexcellent conveyance. In no time the daughter of Janaka, havingexpansive eyes, arrived at the banks of the Ganges removingall sins, Reaching the currents of Bhāgirathi before noonLakshmana, on beholding her, cried aloud.

So this is the time for rejoicing anddo not give me pain at this time. O foremost of men, thoudost spend thine days and nights in the company of Rāma,Thou hast left him for two days only—art thou sorry forthis? Lakshmana—Rāma is also dearer than my life—butI am not so sorry—do thou not be therefore overwhelmedwith grief. Do thou take me to the other side of the Gangesso that I may behold the ascetics and confer upon themclothes and ornaments. Thereupon saluting them duly andspending a night we shall return to the capital. I am alsoanxious to sec Rāma, having eyes like lotus petals,breast like that of a lion and foremost of men.\" Hearingthe words of Sitā and wiping his beautiful eyes, Lakshmana,the slayer of enemies, sent for boatmen.

Methinks;I committed a mighty iniquity in my pristine existence orbrought about separation between a husband and wife andfor that Rāma hath renounced me albeit I am pure andchaste. O son of Sumitrā, the affliction of residing in theforest appeared to me as pleasure ere this for I knew thatI would be able to serve Rāma's feet. But how shall I, Ogentle one, live in the hermitage being divorced from all mykith and kin? And being afflicted to whom shall I expressmy sorrow? What reply shall I offer unto the asceticswhen they shall ask me 'Child; why hath the high-souledRāghava renounced thee? What sin hast thou committed?'O Saumitri, shall I just renounce my life in the waters ofJāhnavi? But I desist from this for it shall bring about thetermination of my husband's race. O Saumitri, do thoucarry out the orders thou hast received. By renouncingthis wretched wight do thou satisfy the King's orders.But hear, what I say. Without making any distinction,do thou, in my name, with folded hands, bow unto mymothers-in-law and then ask the well-being of thekingdom. Thereupon saluting the pious King do thou addresshim, in my name, saying:—'Thou knowest, O Rāghava,that Sitā is pure, ever devoted unto thee and engagedin thy well-being. She knows it full well, that afraid ofa bad name thou hast renounced her. It is her duty toput a stop to thy ill-name and censure; for thou arther excellent refuge.' Do thou tell further-more thatking established in righteousness to treat the citizens ashis brothers, to acquire piety by protecting his subjectsduly—for this is the greatest morality and by this maybe acquired excellent fame. Tell him that I am not sorryfor my person—my greatest sorrow is that the citizenshave vilified me. Husband is a woman's god—her friendand spiritual guide. It is proper therefore to work outhusband's well-being even at the sacrifice of life. Dothou, O Lakshmana, communicate it in short untoRāma, in my name; Do thou go now and beholdthe signs of pregnancy are manifest in me.\" Sitāhaving said this, Lakshmana, with a bewildered heart, salutedher touching the ground with his head, he could not speakmore. Thereupon bewailing aloud and circumambulatingher, he, meditating a little, said. \"What art thou speakingunto me, O worshipful dame? O thou having no sin, up tothis time I have not seen any portion of thy beautiful personbut feet. This is a solitary forest and besides theworshipful Rāma, is not present here—under thesecircumstances how can I cast looks upon thee?\" Having addressedSitā in this wise Lakshmana again sent for a boat andascending it ordered the boatmen to go. Thereupon havingreached the other side and being beside himself with sorrowand grief he speedily ascended the car. And casting hislooks behind while proceeding he espied that Sitā, on theother side of the Ganges, was roving wildly like one havingnone to look after her. Looking again and again whenSitā saw that Lakshmana and the chariot have gone beyondthe range of her vision, she became overwhelmed withanxiety and grief. Being sunk in grief and pressed downwith the weight of sorrow on not beholding Rāma, theforemost of the illustrious, the chaste Sitā began to cry aloudin the forest resounded with the notes of peacocks."

It is better that thou shouldst see her once.That beautiful damsel, like a goddess falling from heavenbeing bewildered, is waiting on the banks of the river. Wesaw her alone crying aloud being overwhelmed with sorrowand grief as if she had none to look after her. Adamsel like her should not be subject to such acondition.

  "Uttara Kānda": "Beholding the great ascetic Vālmiki thusconducting Sitā into his own hermitage Lakshmana's heart wasbewildered with grief. Thereupon he said to the expertcharioteer Sumantra. \"Do thou perceive Rāma's griefconsequent upon the separation from Sitā. Hisspouse—the daughter of Janaka, is perfectly pure; what can bemore painful than that Rāma is living alone having renouncedher? It is clear unto me, O Sumantra, that this separationof Rāma, hath been brought about by the influence ofdestiny—for it is hard to get over accident. Even thatRāma, who, when enraged, is capable of slaying thecelestials, Gandharvas, Asuras and Rākshasas, hath been engagedin the worship of destiny. Formerly did Rāma go throughmiseries, residing in the forest of Dandaka, at thecommand of his sire for fourteen years. But this banishmentof Sitā appears to me as exceedingly painful and mostruthless. O charioteer, the opinion of the citizens is by nomeans just; consequently what shall we gain byperforming such a bad action for fame as the exile of Sitā?\"Hearing those words of Lakshmana, the wise Sumantrareverentially replied:—\"Be not aggrieved for Sitā, OSaumitri. Formerly in the presence of thy sire theBrahmananas related this account of Sitā's exile. Rāma shallbe deprived of all happiness and be separated from hisdear wife; what more, the virtuous-souled Rāma, havinglong arms, shall, under the influence of time, renounce thee,Sitā, Satrughna and Bharata. O Lakshmana, when Durbasawas addressed by the king Daçaratha as to thy future hereplied in the above way. I have told thee the same. Do thounot communicate this unto Satrughna, Bharata or any body.O foremost of men, Durbasa said this unto Daçaratha beforeme, Vasishtha and other great men. Hearing the wordsof Rishi, Daçaratha, the foremost of men, said unto me,'O charioteer, do not reveal this secret to any body.' Ogentle one, it is not proper by any means to falsify the wordsof the king Daçaratha. I shall always, very carefully, carryout his orders. It is not proper to reveal this mysterybefore thee. Still I do so for thy curiosity hath been greatlyexcited. Though this mystery was communicated formerlyby the king Daçaratha and though it is not proper to revealit to any body, still I express it before thee that thou maystnot, on hearing it, be worked up with sorrow; for destinyis hard to be got over. And it is by the influence of thatdestiny that thou hast met with such a sorrow and grief.However, do thou not reveal this secret unto Satrughna andBharata.\" Hearing these grave and important words ofSumantra, Lakshmana ordered him to relate."

He saw the great ascetic Durbāsā,burning like the sun in his effulgence, seated on the righthand side of Vasishtha. Thereupon he humbly saluted thosetwo leading ascetics. And they too, welcoming him, receivedhim duly with seat, water to wash feet, Arghya, fruits androots. Then he lived there in the company of the ascetics.Thereupon during the noon, all those ascetics, seated there,began to dwell upon various pleasant topics. During aninterval Daçaratha, with folded hands and uplifted arms, saidto the high-souled son of Atri—Durbāsā, having asceticismfor his wealth. 'O illustrious Sir, how long shall my familyremain in existence? What is the extent of the lease of lifegranted to Rāma and my other sons? How long shall thedescendants of Rāma live? And what shall be the end ofmy race? Do thou relate all this unto me.' Hearing thewords of the king Daçaratha the highly effulgent Durbāsā,replied:—'Hear, the early history, O king. During theencounter between the celestials and Asuras, the demons,being remonstrated with by the celestials sought shelterof the wife of Vrigu—thy priest. Vrigu's wife havingpromised them help they lived there fearlessly. Havingbeheld the demons thus helped by Vriju's wife, Hari, theking of the celestials, enraged, chopped off her head withhis sharp discus. And angry on beholding his wife slain,Vrigu, imprecated a curse on Vishnu, the slayer of enemies'race, saying—\"Being beside thyself with anger thou hast slainmy wife, not worthy of being killed; therefore, O Janārddana,thou shalt be born in the region of mortals. And therethou shalt remain separated from thy spouse for many longyears.\" Having imprecated this curse, Vrigu was greatlypained and being propitiated by his adoration, Vishnu, fondof disciples, said: \"Having slain Rāvana and others, I shallbe, for the behoof of mankind, subject to this imprecation.\"O bestower of kings, the highly effulgent Vishnu, thusimprecated by Vrigu in the days of yore, hath been born asthy son in this birth and hath been celebrated under theappellation of Rāma. O conferrer of honors, for sooth shallRāma partake of the fruits of Vrigu's curse. He shall reign inAyodhyā for a long time. All his followers shall be happy andprosperous. Having reigned for eleven thousand yearsRāma shall repair to the region of Brahmā. None shallbe able to vanquish him. He shall celebrate many ahorse-sacrifice with profuse gifts and shall establish manyroyal families. He shall beget on Sitā two sons.'Having thus related unto Daçaratha the past and futureof his family the highly effulgent great ascetic Durbāsābecame silent. He being silent—the great King Daçaratha,having bowed unto the two high-souled ascetics, againreturned to his city Ayodhyā. I had heard there all thesewords of the great ascetic Durbāsā. Up to this time theyare lying in my heart. Rishis' words shall never provefruitless. According to the words of Rishi Rāma shallinstall two sons of Sitā in Ayodhyā, not anywhere else.Under these circumstances, O Lakshmana, thou shouldstnot grieve for Sitā or Rāma; in their interest do thoubecome patient.\" Hearing those wonderous words of thecharioteer Sumantra, Lakshmana became greatly happyand eulogised him again and again. They thusconversing with one another on their way back, the sun set.They accordingly spent that night on the banks of Kesini."

But thehigh-souled Lakshmana became greatly sorry stricken withthe thought as to what he should relate on approachingthe feet of Rāma. Whilst proceeding with this thoughthe saw the highly picturesque palace of Rāma resemblingthe rays of the moon. Having descended from his carat the palace-gate, Lakshmana, the foremost of men, withhis face downwards and a distressed heart, unobstructed,entered the palace. Having entered there he saw hiselder brother Rāma seated poorly on an excellent seatwith his eyes full of tears.

Having leftthat illustrious pure lady at the skirt of the hermitageI have again dome to serve thy feet. Do thou not grieve,O foremost of men, for such is the course of time. Theintelligent people like thee do not grieve. Where there isgrowth there is decay, where there is prosperity there is ruin,and where there is birth there is death.

And if dost thou grieve for that spouse thycalumny shall undoubtedly be deep-rooted in the kingdom.Therefore do thou restore thyself patiently, O foremost ofmen. Do thou give up this weakness and be not sorry.\"The intelligent Lakshmana, the son of Sumitrā, having saidthis, Rāma, the descendant of Kākutstha and fond offriends, with great delight said:—\"Thou hast spoken thetruth, O Lakshmana, O foremost of men.

But O beautifulSaumitri, do thou, apprised of my intention, carry out mywords. O gentle son of Sumitrā, for not looking to statebusiness for these four days I have been pierced to the veryvitals. Do thou therefore call here men, or women, priestsor councillors who have come for business. For sooth doa king falls into the dreadful hell where the wind doth notblow, who does not daily look into his state affairs. I haveheard, O foremost of men, that there lived in the days ofyore a highly illustrious, truthful and pure-minded king, everdevoted unto the Brāhmanas, by the name of Nriga. Onceon a time at the sacred pilgrimage of Pushpaka that kingconferred upon the Brāhmanas one Koti of kine withcalves adorned with golden ornaments.Accidentally on that occasion, a cow with calf belongingto a poor Brahman, living upon low means, was givenaway along with other kine. Undergoing hunger and thirst,the master of that lost cow travelled for a long timein many places in search of it. Thereupon havingreached the province of Kanakhal he espied his owncow in the house of a Brāhmana. The cow was well keptand the young one was grown up. Thereupon the Brahmancalled the cow by the name given by him saying 'Savalā,come.' The cow heard that and recognizing the voice of theBrahman followed him. And he preceded her burning like fire.And the Brāhmana, in whose house the cow so long remained,speedily pursued her and approaching the ascetic said.'This cow is mine. The king Nriga conferred this uponme.' So there arose a great quarrel between the twolearned Brāhmanas. And thus quarreling they bothapproached him who had given away the cow. And thoughthey waited for a long time at the gate they did not obtainpermission to enter the palace. Thereat both of them weregreatly engraged and imprecated dreadful curses, saying'Since thou hast not granted us an interview though wehave been waiting here for a long time, thou shalt, by ourcurse, remain invisible, being a lizard. Thou shalt in thisstate live in a den for many hundred and thousand years.When Vishnu assuming a human person shall be born in theVasudeva family of Yadavas and enhance their glory he shallliberate thee from the curse. Immediately before the adventof the Kali Yuga the Rishi Nara Nārāyana gifted with greatprowess shall descend upon earth to relieve her of the burden.'Having thus imprecated the curse upon the king the Rishisbecame silent. The cow was old and weak so they both,with mutual consent, conferred that upon another Brahman.O Lakshmana, the king Nriga is still suffering from thatdreadful curse. It is the king's folly that is manifest fromthe mutual disagreement of the workers. Do thou bringthem all speedily to me who have come for business. For,sooth shall the kings profit by the just administration.Do thou therefore go in person, O Lakshmana and seewho hath come for business.\""

May I ask thee, O foremost of men, whatdid that King say unto the Brahmans when he wasthus imprecated?\" Whereto Rāma replied saying:—\"Ogentle one, hear, what the king Nriga said whenimprecated. Hearing of the departure of the Brāhmanas hesent for his priest, minister, the citizens and subjects andfilled with sorrow said:—'Do ye all hear attentivelymy words.

Living therein I shall waste the curse of the Brahmans.Let the architects dig one den to protect me against the rains,one against the affliction of the winter and one against thedistresses of summer. Let them enhance the picturesquenessof those dens by planting many trees having profusebranches and fruits and flowers. As long as time shall notchange so long I shall spend my days happily in the den.For half a league on all sides around me let flower treesbe planted.' Having made those arrangements and placedVasu on the throne the king Nriga said:—'Do not swervefrom the path of morality, O my son, and do thou duly governthe subjects according to the custom of the Kshatryas.Thou hast seen, with thine own eyes, the curse that theBrāhmanas have given me being enraged for a very triflingfolly of mine. Do thou not repent for me. My son, timeis the lord of happiness and sorrow; it is by the influenceof time that I have fallen into such a disaster. Creaturesmust meet with what is kept in store by destiny; they mustgo where they are bound for and they mustacquire what is set apart for them. Pristine actions are theroot of all these; so, be not sorry, O my son.'

He wasthe twelfth of Ikshwāku's sons. That powerful king made apicturesque city like that of the celestials near thehermitage of Gautama. The name of that beautiful citywas Vaijayanta and the highly illustrious royal saintused to live there. Having thus reared a highlypicturesque city he thought of worshipping the deity bycelebrating a sacrifice for the satisfaction of hissire. Having thus resolved and invited his sire Ikshwākuthe son of Manu, he first welcomed the celestial saint. Nimithe descendant of Ikshwāku, then welcomed the saints Atri,Angiras and Vrigu having asceticism for their wealth.Thereupon Vasishtha said to Nimi, the foremost of royalsaints—'I have already been engaged by Indra. Do thou thereforewait as long as his sacrifice is not finished there.' Afterthe departure of Vasishtha the great Gautama engaged inthe satisfaction of Vasistha's duties. And the high-souledVasishtha too engaged in Indra's sacrifice. On theother hand having united all the Brahmans the greatking began to celebrate the sacrifice extending over fivethousand years near his city by the side of theHimalaya. Thereupon having finished the sacrifice ofIndra there came to the King, the blameless and theillustrious Rishi Vashishtha. Finding Gautama engagedin his room he was exceedingly enraged. Thereuponhe waited there for some time to see the King. On thatday the royal saint Nimi was deeply asleep. And notbeholding the King the high-souled Vasishtha was greatlyangry and said:—'Since thou hast, O King, engagedanother neglecting me, thy body shall remain senseless.'Thereupon hearing the curse of Vasishtha, the king got up.There beside himself with ire he said—'I was unconsciousin sleep—still soiled with anger thou hast hurled the fierycurse against me like the second rod of Yama.Therefore, O ascetic, thy person shall remain senseless for along time.' That king and the ascetic having thusimprecated one another under the influence of anger, theyimmediately were deprived of their bodies.\""

Thereupon being thus deprived of his body the highlyeffulgent and great ascetic Vasishtha went to the PatriarchBrahmā with the object of acquiring from him another.Being merged in the air, he, conversant with religion,bowed unto his father and said:—'O illustrious god of gods!O thou lotus-sprung! By the imprecation of Nimi I havebeen now deprived of my body and been converted intoair. O lord, the state of being bodiless is highly painfulto all. The bodiless cannot perform any work; do thou,therefore, by thy favour, grant me another body.'Whereto the self-sprung Brahmā, of unmitigated prowess, replied.'O great one, do thou enter into the vital energy of Mitraand Varuna; and even then, O foremost of twice-born ones,thou shalt not be born of a woman and being greatly piousshalt attain to the rank of a patriarch.' The PatriarchBrahmā having said this, Vasishtha, saluting andcircumambulating him, repaired to the region of Varuna.At that time Mitra in conjunction with Varuna was reigningin Varuna's kingdom being worshipped by all celestials.Meanwhile encircled by her mates the leading Apsarā arrivedthere at her pleasure. Beholding the frolicsome andbeautiful Urvasi, Varuna attained to an excess of delight.Thereupon he expressed his intention of living with that queenof Apsarās, having a moon-like countenance and lotus-eyes.Thereat Urvasi, with folded hands, said—'O lord of celestials,Mitra himself has already invited me for the same.' Beingstricken by desire Varuna said to Urvasi 'I shall dischargemy vital energy into this pot if thou dost not wish to livewith me.' Hearing those sweet words of the PatriarchVaruna, Urvasi was highly pleased and said:—'Do whatthou hast said. Now my body is under the possession ofMitra—but my mind is attached unto thine and thou artequally attached unto me.' Urvasi having said this, Varunadischarged his vital energy into the pot. Thereupon Urvasiapproached Mitra. And thereat highly enraged he said toher 'I invited thee first; O thou of vicious actions, why hastthou, renouncing me, secured another. For this vile action,thou shalt, by my curse live in the land of mortals for sometime. The royal saint Puruvarā, the king of Kasi, is theson of Budha. Do thou go to him, thou of a viciousintellect; he shall be thy husband.' Thereupon being thusplaced under the influence of curse Urvasi went to Puruvarā,The king Puruvarā was the begotten son of Budha. Hereigned in the foremost of cities Pratishtaro. He begot onUrvasi a highly powerful and beautiful son by the name ofAyu. Nahusha, powerful as Indra, was the son of Ayu.When Indra, the king of the celestials, was assailed withthunderbolt by the Asura Vitra, Nahusha governed his kingdomfor a hundred thousand years.

Heis the moon, death, Yama, Kuvera, the giver of riches, fire,Indra, the sun and Varuna. O Saumitri, do thou go andcommunicate unto the king protecting his subjects thatwithout his permission I do not wish to go there.\"Thereupon the highly effulgent and noble-minded Lakshmanaentered the palace and said to Rāma:—\"O thou having longarms, O thou the enhancer of Kausalyā's joy—I havecommunicated thine orders—I shall relate shortly everythingregarding that; do thou hear. That dog, as a beggar, iswaiting at the gate for thy commands.\" Whereto Rāmareplied:—\"Bring him speedily here who is waiting at thegate for business.\""

  "Uttara Kānda": "Hearing the words of Rāma the intelligent Lakshmanaimmediately sent for the dog and informed Rāma, who,on beholding it, said—\"Do thou communicate thy desireunto me; be not afraid.\" Thereupon beholding the kingRāma, the dog, having his head cut off, said \"The king isthe protector of animals and their lord. The king isawake when the subjects are asleep and he protects them.By administering the laws properly the king protects piety.Without his shelter the subjects meet with destruction. Theking is the lord and father of the whole universe. He istime, he is Yuga and he is the creation, mobile and immobile.He is called Dharma because he holdeth all. It is Dharma(virtue) that upholdeth all mankind. It is by Dharma thatthe three worlds are being preserved. It is Dharma or virtuethat thwarts the enemies. It is virtue that governs thesubjects duly. It is for this that virtue is called Dhāranaor the holder. The virtue of preservation is the greatest andconfers fruits in after life. There is nothing like virtue hardto acquire in this world. Charity, kindness, honoring thepious and innocent conduct constitute the chief virtues; forby those the well-being of this life and the next is broughtabout. O Rāghava, O thou of firms vows—thou art an exampleof examples. Thou art cognizant of the conduct of the pious.Thou art like an ocean, the refuge of all virtues. Oforemost of kings, out of ignorance, I have spoken unto thee somany things. With my head downwards, I beg for thysatisfaction. Be not offended with me.\" Hearing those wise wordsof the dog, Rāma said—\"What shall I do for thee?Do thou mention it confidentially.\" Whereto the dogreplied, saying:—\"It is by piety that a king governs hiskingdom—it is by virtue that a king protects his subjects,becomes a refuge unto all and removes the fear of his men.Keeping an eye on this, O Rāma do thou hear, what I say.In the house of a certain Brahman there lives a beggar bythe name of Sarvarthasiddha (i.e., who has got all hisdesires satisfied). And although I am innocent, he has fornothing hurt me.\" Hearing those words Rāma sent hismessenger who brought Sarvarthasiddha, master of allsubjects. Thereupon beholding Rāma in the assembly thateffulgent and leading twice-born one said:—\"O blamelessRāma, tell me what I shall do for thee.\" Whereto Rāmasaid—\"O twice-born one, thou hast hurt this dog. Whatoffence did it commit by thee that thou didst strike itseverely with a rod. Anger is an enemy which taketh awaylife. Anger is a sweet-speeched enemy in the garb of afriend. It is the foremost of passions and like unto a sharpdagger. And it is anger that stealeth away every thing. Itpilfers all that is acquired by asceticism, sacrifices and gifts.It is proper therefore by every means to kill anger. Passionsare running amock on all sides like so many exceedinglywicked steeds. Being satiated with of all objects ofenjoyments it is better to govern them by patience. By mind,actions, words and eyes a man should engage in the wellbeing of people. He should not injure any body and benot addicted to any thing. The harm, that a mind notunder control, can accomplish, is beyond the range of a sharpdagger, trodden serpent and of an enemy always enraged.Even the nature of one, who has learnt humility, cannot betrusted. He, who hides his nature, himself reveals his trueself.\" Rāma, of unwearied actions, having said this,Sarvarthasiddha, the foremost of twice-born ones, said:—\"Knockingabout the whole day for alms I was highly enraged and struckthis dog. It was sitting in the mid-way and I askedit again and again to move away. Thereupon, moving awayand standing with reluctance, it stood fearfully on theroad-side. O descendant of Raghu, I was at that time strickenwith hunger, and struck it for its vicious conduct. O kingof kings, I am guilty in this, and thou must punish me. O lordof kings, do thou administer punishment unto me,—I shallthen be released from the fear of hell.\" Thereupon, Rāmaasked all the ministers, saying:—\"What is to be done now?What punishment is to be inflicted on him? We can protectsubjects, if we can administer punishment proportionate tocrime.\" Thereat, Vrigu, Angiras, Kutsa, Vasishtha,Kashya and other ascetics, the leading preachers, theministers, the citizens, and other sages conversant withSastras, present there, said:—\"A Brāhmana should not bepunished with death.\" The sages conversant with lawshaving said this, the ascetics addressed Rāma,saying:—\"O Rāghava, a king is the governor of all—specially thyself.Thou art the chastiser of the three worlds, the eternalVishnu.\" They all having said this, the dog began:—\"Thoudidst solemnly say 'What shall I do for thee?' Therefore,if thou art gratified with me, and if thou dost wish toconfer boons on me, do thou appoint this Brāhmana as thehead of family.\" Thereupon, having been thus honored andpleased and ascending an elephant, he proceeded to occupyhis new dignified station. At this, the councillors ofRāma, surprised, said:—\"O thou of great effulgence, he hasnot been punished. Rather thou hast conferred on him aboon.\" Hearing the words of ministers, Rāma said:—\"Youdo not know the real truth of the whole thing—the dogknows it well.\" Being accosted by Rāma, the dogsaid:—\"O Rāghava, I was the head of the family ofKālanjava. After the worship of the deities and Brāhmanaand the feasting of the servants, male, and female, I used totake my food. I used to parcel out things duly, and my mindwas not in the least attached to sin. I used to preserve withgreat care the articles belonging to the tutelary deities, washumble, good-natured and engaged in the well-being of allanimals. Still I have fallen into this dreadful and wretchedcondition. O Rāghava, this Brāhmana is angry by nature,and impious, injures others, and is impatient, cruel, harsh inwords and ignorant, and therefore shall degrade his sevengenerations up and down. He will by no means be able todischarge the duties of a head of a family. He, whom thouwishest to take to hell with her son, beasts and friends, shouldbe engaged in the serving the Brāhmans and kine. For all hisgood actions, he is slain who steals the wealth of a Brāhmana,a deity, a woman, and a boy, and the riches given away by him.O Rāghava, one who pilfers the riches of a Brāhmana or a deityfalls into a hell called Vichi. Even he who thinks inhis mind of stealing it, goes once and again into hell.\" Hearingthe words of the dog, the eyes of the effulgent Rāma wereexpanded with surprise. The dog went back from where ithad come. In its pristine birth the dog washigh-minded—it is now cursed for being born in a degraded state ofexistence. Thereupon, repairing at last to Vārānasi the dogtook the vow of fasting."

  "Uttara Kānda": "There lived for a long time a vulture and an owl ona mountain extending over the banks of a river, resonantwith the notes of cuckoos and filled with lions, tigers andvarious birds, situated in a pleasant forest abounding in treesnear the city of Ayodhyā. Once on a time the viciousvulture alleging that the nest of the owl was his own, beganto quarrel with him. O worshipful Sir, thereupon they bothsaid:—\"The lotus-eyed Rāma is the king of all people;let us go to him and he will decide to whom the nestbelongs.\" Having thus settled the vulture and the owl,being impatient with rage, quarrelling with one another,appeared before Rāma and touched his feet.Beholding that lord of men, the vulture said: \"O preserver ofhumanity, thou art the foremost of celestials and Asuras.O thou of great effulgence, thou art gifted with intelligenceand learning more than Vrihaspati and Sukrachārya. Thouart cognisant of the good and bad conditions of creatures.In beauty thou art like the Moon and art irrepressible like theSun. In glory thou art like Himalaya, in gravity like theOcean, in prowess like the Patriarch, in patience like theEarth, and in velocity like the Wind. O Rāghava, thou artthe preceptor of the mobile and immobile creation, giftedwith all sorts of wealth, illustrious, devoid of a revengefulspirit, unconquerable, victorious, and master of all Sastrasand laws. O foremost of men, hear. I have an applicationto thee. O Rāghava, I had built a nest for myself; thisowl is now occupying it as his own; therefore, O king, dothou save me.\" The vulture having said this, the owlbegan:—\"True, it is, O king, that in him are the portionsof the Moon, Indra, the Sun, Kuvera and Yama, but thereis in him also a portion of man. But thou art thyself theomnipresent deity, Nārāyana. Thou, impelled by thine ownself, dost judge all creatures impartially; therefore, aportion of gentleness is well manifest in thee and thereforedo people call thee, a portion of the Moon. O patriarch, inanger, punishment, gift and fear, thou art our giver, destroyerand protector,—it is for this that thou art called Indra. Inenergy thou art like fire irrepressible unto all creatures, andbecause thou dost spread thy lusture upon all creatures, thatthou art called the Sun. Thou art the very lord of richesor art even superior to Kuvera; like Padmā unto the lord ofriches, Sri is always by thee. Because thou dost dischargethe functions of Kuvera, thou art the giver of wealth untous. O Rāghava, thou lookest upon all creatures, mobileand immobile, with an impartial eye—thou dost regard thyfriends and foes with impartiality, and thou art duly protectingthy subjects. O Rāghava, death pursues him with whomthou art offended—and it is for this reason that thou artstyled by people 'the highly powerful Yama.' O foremost ofkings, because thou art forgiving unto all creatures anda kind king that people sing thy glories as of a man on earth.The king is the strength of the weak and helpless and heis the eye of the blind and the refuge of those who have noshelter. Thou art also our king; therefore do thou listento our petition. O king, entering into my nest, this vultureis oppressing me. Thou only, O foremost of men, art thedivine chastiser of mankind.\" Hearing those words, Rāmasent for his councillors. The ministers of Daçarathaand Rāma, Vrishthi, Yayanta, Vijaya, Siddhārtha,Rāshtravarddhana, Asoka, Darmapāla the highly powerfulSumantra and others were well versed in laws, high-minded,conversant with all the Sastras, intelligent, born inrespectable families, and adepts in counsel. Having invited themall and ascending his Pushpaka car, he went to the place inquestion, and, descending there, asked the vulture, \"How longhas this nest been made? Tell me, if thou rememberit.\" Whereto the vulture replied:—\"From the timemankind were first born and spread over the four quartersof the globe have I been living in this nest.\" The owlsaid:—\"At the time when the earth was (first) adorned withtrees that this nest of mine was constructed.\" Hearing thesewords, Rāma said to the councillors:—\"That assembly is notan assembly where there are no friends—nor are they oldmen who do not dwell upon religious topics. That religionis not a religion where there is no truthand that truth is not the truth where there ishypocrisy. Those councillors are liars who do not giveproper replies in time on the subjects they are well-informedon. He who does give reply to a question under theinfluence of passion, anger or fear, binds himself witha thousand nooses of Varuna, and at the expiration of fullone year he is released from a single sin.\" Hearing thesewords, the ministers said to Rāma:—\"O thou having a largemind, what the owl has said is true—the vulture has notspoken the truth. Thou art the evidence this, O greatking—for the king is the last refuge of all—the root of thesubject and the eternal religion. He who is punished bythe king, is not doomed to a degraded state. He is, intruth, saved from the fear of hell and reaches a better state.\"Hearing the words of the ministers, Rāma said:—\"Hearwhat is mentioned in the Puranas. Formerly the Sun, theMoon, the welkin with the stars, the earth with the mountainsand forests—the three worlds, the mobile and the immobile,were under water. At that time only Nārāyana existed asthe second Sumeru. In Nārāyana's belly was stationedthe earth with Lakshmi. Having destroyed thecreation and entered water, the highly effulgent Vishnu,identical with the souls of creatures, lay asleep there formany long years. Beholding Vishnu asleep after thedestruction of the universe and knowing Vishnu ofobstructed breath, the great ascetic Brahmā entered his abdomen.Thereupon, when a golden lotus sprang from Vishnu's navel.That great lord, ascetic Brahmā, originated therefrom andwas engaged in austere penances for the purpose of creatingearth, air, mountains, trees, men, reptiles and all animalsborn from womb or egg. At that time from the ears ofNārāyana originated two valiant and dreadful demons underthe name of Madhu and Kaitabha. Beholding the Patriarch,there they were greatly enraged, and pursued him. Thereat,the self-born cried aloud hideously. Awakened by that sound,Nārāyana engaged in fighting with Madhu and Kaitabha, andslew them with his discus. And with their gore the wholeearth was deluged. Thereupon, purifying the earth again,Hari, preserver of the world, covered it with trees.And various drugs were also created. And the earthwas called Medini because it was filled with Medasmarrow of Madhu and Kaitabha. It is for this that I hold,O ministers, that this house does not belong to the vulture,but to the owl. Therefore, this vicious vultureshould be punished—for this wicked, vicious-minded one,robbing another's nest, is oppressing him.\" In the intervala voice was heard in the sky stating the truefacts:—\"O Rāma, do not slay the vulture,—for it has already beenreduced to ashes by the force of Gautama's asceticism.O lord of men, this vulture, in its pristine birth, was a heroictruthful and pure king by the name of Brahmadatta. Onceon a time a Brāhamana, by the name of Gautama, the verypersonification of Kāla, came to the house of Brahmadattafor food and said:—'O king, I shall feed in thyhouse for more than a hundred years.' Thereupon, offeringthat effulgent Brāhmana, with his own hands, water to washhis feet the king Brahmadatta, made arrangements for his meal.Accidentally flesh was mixed with the food of thehigh-souled Gautama. Being enraged thereat, the asceticimprecated him with a dreadful curse and said:—'O king,thou become a vulture.' The king said:—'Be propitiated,O thou of great vows; do not imprecate me thus. I have,out of ignorance committed this offence. O great one,O blameless one, do thou act so that this cursemay find termination.' Thereat understanding thatthis offence was committed by the king unwittingly, theascetic said—'O king, in the race of Ikshwākus a king shallbe born under the name of Rāma. O foremost of men, thoushalt be released from the curse when he shall touch thee.'\"Hearing the voice in the sky, Rāma touched Brahmadatta.Thereupon renouncing his vulture from and assuming abeautiful body smeared with celestial perfumes, he praisedRāma and said:—\"O thou conversant with piety, by thyFavour have I been saved from the dreadful hell—here hathended my curse.\""

  "Uttara Kānda": "As Rāma and Lakshmana were (daily) engaged inconversing thus, the vernal night, neither hot nor cold, cameon. And it came to pass that one bright morning, afterhaving performed his first diurnal rites, Kākutstha,understanding the ways of the citizens, became anxious to presenthimself at a spot whence he could observe the citizens. Atthis time Sumantra, entering, addressed him, saying,—\"Oking, stopped at the gate, some ascetics staythere,—Maharshis, led by Bhārgava and Chyavana. And, O mightymonarch, eager for a sight of thee, those dwellers on thebanks of the Yamunā, well pleased, have despatched me(hither), O tiger among men.\" Hearing his words, therighteous Rāma answered: \"Let the exalted Dwijas enter.\"Thereat, honoring the royal mandate, the warder with joinedhands brought those ascetics difficult of being approached.And numbering over an hundred, flaming up in their nativeeffulgence, those high-souled anchorets entered the royalresidence. And they presented Rāma with various fruits inprofusion and vessels filled with sanctified watersof all holy spots. Thereupon, accepting the waters of theholy places as well as the various kinds of fruit, thatmighty-armed one spake to the mighty ascetics: \"Do ye agreeablyto desert take these seats.\" Hearing Rāma's speech, allthe Maharshis sat down on those graceful and elegantgolden seats. And seeing the saints seated there, that captorof hostile capitals, Rāghava, restraining himself, with joinedhands, observed: \"What is the reason of your visit? Whatshall I needfully perform for you? I am worthy of beingcommanded by the Maharshis; and I must without demurcompass every pleasure of theirs. And this entire monarchy,and the life that is resident in my heart,—all these are for theregenerate ones. This I tell you in the name of truth.\"Hearing his words, the sages of fierce austerities inhabitingthe banks of the Yamunā, broke out into a peal of plaudits.And those high-souled ones, exceedingly rejoiced, said: \"Onearth, O crown of men, this can only be expected from theeand nobody else. Many kings wielding great power havepassed away who, having regard to the (possible) gravityof the undertaking, could not bring themselves to promiseanything beforehand. But, without knowing he task, thouhast bound thyself by a promise for the glory of the Brāhmanas.And thou, without doubt, wilt succeed in effecting the work;and it behoveth thee to deliver the sages from a mightyfright.\""

  "Uttara Kānda": "When the sages had spoken thus, Kakutstha said: \"Oascetics, tell me what is the work which I shall have toaccomplish in your behalf. Your fear shall be removed.\" AsKākutstha was speaking thus, Bhargava remarked: \"O lordof men, do thou hear of the origin of the fear that threatensour country. O king, formerly in the Krita age, there wasa magnanimous offspring of Diti, the mighty Asura, Madu,eldest son of Lotā. He was well disposed towardsBrāhmanas, kind to those seeking his refuge, and gifted withhigh intelligence. The exceedingly generous deities delightedin him greatly. And by way of honoring him, Rudraconferred a wonderful boon upon Madhu endowed with prowessand ever intent on religion. And extracting a dart fromhis own, possessed of terrific energy, endowed with greatforce, and furnished with exceeding splendour, that high-souledone, well pleased, made it over (to Madhu) and spoke to him.Thou hast practised excellent and unrivalled righteousness,which hath won my good graces, and (therefore), I, highlygratified, bestow on thee this choice weapon. So long asthou, O mighty Asura, dost not assail celestials and Vipras,so long shall this be thine,—otherwise it shall come to naught.Reducing to cinders the person that shall rashly enter uponconflict with thee, this dart shall return to thy hand.\" Havingthus obtained the boon from Rudra, the mighty Asura, againbowing to Mahādeva, addressed him, saying: \"O reverendone, may this excellent dart be the possession of my family.O god, thou art the lord of the immortals.' Thereat the lordof all beings, the mighty deity Siva, answered Madhu, whenhe had spoken thus: 'This will not be. But in orderthat thy prayer may not go for nothing, I graciously say inthy behalf that one of thy sons shall sway this dart. Solong that dart-handed one shall be incapable of beingdestroyed by any creature.’ Having obtained thiswonderful boon from the god, Madhu—foremost ofAsuras—caused a splendid city to be constructed. His beloved wifethe exalted and majestic Kumbhinasi is the offspring ofViçwavasu by Analā. Her son, the highly powerful wicked,and fierce Lavana, ever since his boyhood, gave himself up toa sinful course of life. Seeing his son, committed to animpious course Madhu was overcome with grief, but he didnot say anything to him. And forsaking this world, heentered the region of Varuna; and making over the dartunto Lavana, communicated to him all about the boon hehad obtained. And by virtue of the power of the dart, heoppresseth the three worlds in especial the ascetics; such isthe power of Lavana, and such is his dart. Hearing all thisO Kākutstha, thou art capable (of righting our wrong.)Thou art our chief resource. O Rāma many a monarch hathbeen already sued by the sages, O hero, to deliver them fromthis fear,—but we have not yet found a deliverer. Hearing,O child, that Rāvana together with all his forces and vehicleshath been destroyed (by thee), we know that there breathesnot another king on earth capable of delivering us.Therefore our prayer is that thou mayst deliver us afflictedwith the fear of Lavana. Thus, O Rāma, have we acquaintedthee with the occasion of fear that hath arisen. Thou artcapable of coping with the same. Do thou of undeterioratedprowess, do the needful.\""

And where doth Lavana live?\" HearingRāghava's words, the sages informed him of the way inwhich Lavana increased in power. \"His food is every creaturespecially ascetics; his manner of life is regulated by ferocityand his constant home is Madhuvana. Slaying constantlythousands on thousands of lions and tigers and deer, andbirds and human beings, he provides his daily food (withtheir flesh.) And like the Destroyer on the occasion of theuniversal dissolution, that one possessed of gigantic strengthfeeds on other creatures as well.\" Hearing this, Rāghavaspoke to the mighty ascetics: \"I will slay that Raksha. Letyour fright depart.\" Having thus bound himself with thatpromise to the ascetics of fierce energy, Raghu's son alongwith his brothers spoke: \"What hero shall slay Lavana? Doyou decide this. On whom shall devolve this duty? Whetherthe mighty armed Bharata or the intelligent Satrughna shall(do this work?)\" Thus addressed by Rāghava Bharataremarked: \"I will slay this. Let this task be entrusted tome.\" Hearing Bharata's speech instinct with fortitude andvalor, the younger brother of Lakshmana stood up, leavinghis golden seat. And Satrughna, saluting the kingrepresented: \"The mighty-armed second son of Raghuhath already achieved a grand work: he formerlygoverned Ayodhyā empty of the noble one,96 bearingin his heart the grief connected with his return.Undergoing many a hardship, king, that illustrious onepassed his days, lying down on a bed of sorrow, and livingon fruits and roots, and wearing rags. Having suffered suchmisery, Raghu's son should not be suffered to undergotrouble, while, O king I his servant is by.\" On Satrughnasaying this, Rāghava again said: \"Let this be so. Do thoudo my bidding. I shall install thee on the graceful city ofMadhu; or if thou wish without and entrust Bharata withthis task, O long-armed one. Heroic, and accomplished, thouart competent to found a city on the Yamunā as well asflourishing provinces. He that, having people'sdominion, doth not furnish it with a king, goeth to hell.

Wherefore, an elder brotherexisting, wouldst thou install a younger one? I must, Obest of men, do thy behest; for, O exalted one, thy mandatecan never be passed by me. O hero, I have heard from theeas well as from the Sruti (touching the morality concerned).97When my second brother had already vowed (that he wouldslay Lavana), I ought not to have returned the answer Iactually have. I saying,—‘I will in battle slay the dreadfulLavana,’ I have been guilty of an unrighteous speech. Andit is for this transgression that, O powerful one, I shall haveto undergo this improper process. But, albeit this courseis unrighteous and entails perdition, yet desired by my eldestbrother, I certainly ought not to make any answer. And, OKākutstha, a second answer I would not return; so that,O bestower of honor, I may not, by a second reply, rendermyself liable to a fresh punishment. In this matter, O chiefof men, I will even do thy desire. Do thou, O descendantof Raghu, so order that sin may not be mine (in havingobeyed thy mandate.)\" Thus addressed by the heroic andhigh-souled Satrughna, Rāma, delighted, spoke unto Bharataand Lakshmana,—\"Do you carefully provide the thingsnecessary for the coronation: this very day shall I installthat foremost of men, the descendant of Raghu. And bymy order do you summon the Purodhasas, O Kākutstha,and the citizens and the Ritwijas, and the councillors.\"Having received the royal behest, the mighty car-warriorsdid accordingly. And the Kshatriyas and the Brāhmanasentered the royal mansion with the priest as well as therequisite things for the installation. And then commencedthe auspicious sprinkling of the high-souled Satrughna,gladdening (the hearts of all in) the palace of Rāghava. Andon being installed Kākutstha resembled the Sun; and helike Skanda formerly installed by the celestials led by Indra.And when Satrughna had been installed by Rāma of untiringdeeds, the citizens as well as the Brāhmanas of vast Vedicattainments experienced excess of joy. And Kausalyāand Sumitra and Kaikeyi and the other wives of the kingset up festal salutation in the palace. And on Satrughnahaving been installed the high-souled sages dwellingon the banks of the Jamunā, thought that Lavana had beenslain.

With this, O son of Raghu, thou, O placid one,wilt slay Lavana. O Kākutstha, this shaft was forged wheninvisible by celestials and Asuras the divine self-sprungand invincible (deity) reposed on the mighty main, andwhen creation was oppressed by Madhu and Kaitabha aswell as other Rākshasas. He, overwhelmed with ragedesirous of creating the three worlds, created this best of arrowsinvincible to all beings, for the destruction of the wickedones; and destroyed them in battle by means of this veryarrow. And having with this foremost of shafts finishedMadhu and Kaitabha, they set about creating the worlds.When, O Satrughna, formerly I sought to slay Rāvana, Idid not discharge this arrow, thinking that if discharged, itwould inflict great havoc on creatures. Keeping in his abodethat great and redoubted which had been bestowed on Madhuby the high-souled Tryamvaka, for the destruction offoes,—and worshipping the same ever, Lavana goeth about andsecureth excellent fare (for himself) when one challengedhim, desirous of reducing him (his antagonist) to ashes.Therefore, O foremost of men, thou shouldst, before enteringthe city, stand at the gate obstructing his course. O thouhaving long arms, thou shouldst invite him for battle whenhe shall be weaponless and in that way wouldst be ableto destroy him. And by no other means he is to be slain.If thou canst encompass this, he shall forsooth be slain. Omy son, I have thus told thee the way in which the dartshould be thwarted. It is impossible to surpass the prowessof the graceful Nilkantha.\""

To-morrow morning I shall proceedto the dreadful West.\" Hearing the words of thehigh-souled Satrughna, Vālmiki, the foremost of ascetics, repliedsaying:—\"O thou of great renown, do thou wait herewithout any hesitation. O gentle one, this hermitage belongsto the descendants of the Raghu race. Do thou fearlesslytake thy seat and water to wash thy feet.\" Thereupon takingwater to wash his feet and feeding upon fruits and rootsSatrughna attained to great delight. And afterwards he asked thegreat ascetic Vālmiki saying:—\"O great ascetic, to whombelong the articles of sacrifice in the cast near thishermitage?\" Whereto Vālmiki replied \"Satrughna, hear I shalltell thee, whose sacrificial ground was this in the days ofyore. There was a king by the name of Saudāsa—one ofthy ancestors. His son Virjashaha was a highly powerful andpious king. The heroic Saudāsa was fond of hunting fromhis boyhood. Once on a time while a-hunting, he espiedtwo Rakshasas in the forest. He had heard about themmany times before; they were in the shape of tigers and ofa dreadful figure and were not satiated with devouringmany thousand deer. King Saudāsa saw those twoRākshasas and found the forest divested of all creatures.And enraged in consequence thereof he slew one of them.Having slain him and been at ease, Saudāsa, the foremostof men, began to eye that Rākshasa. His mate, greatlyaggrieved, said to him:—'O vicious one, thou hast, withoutany fault, slain my companion—I shall therefore mete outbecoming punishment unto thee.' Having said this theRākshasa vanished therefrom. Thereupon in time the princeVirjashaha became king. Saudāsa engaged in celebratinga mighty horse-sacrifice in the vicinity of this hermitage.Vasishtha officiated as a priest at that sacrifice. It continuedfor many Ayuta years. For immense riches the sacrificeappeared like one performed by the celestials. Thereuponwhen the sacrifice was about to be finished the aforesaidRākshasa, remembering his former enmity, assumed the shapeof Vasishtha and said to the king Saudāsa:—'O king, to-daythe sacrifice shall end; do therefore, without any delay,feed me with meat.' Hearing the words of the Rākshasa inthe guise of a Brahman, the king ordered his expert cooks,saying:—'Do ye soon prepare such dishes of meat as maysatisfy my preceptor Vasishtha.' Having been ordered bythe king the cooks reverentially went away and the Rākshasaassuming their shape brought before the king dishes. Theking and queen offered those dishes unto the asceticVasishtha, who, after being treated to them, perceived thatthey were of human flesh and, terribly enraged, said:—'Oking, let this be thy food which thou hast offered me; thisshall not prove otherwise.' Being enraged on hearing itthe king Saudāsa took water in his palms and was aboutto imprecate Vasishtha, when his queen, preventing himsaid:—'O king, the illustrious great ascetic Vasishtha isour preceptor and priest and so thou shouldst not imprecatehim.' Hearing those words of his queen, the king Saudāsa,threw off that powerful water on his own feet which at oncebecame dark. From that time the illustrious king Saudāsabecame also known by the name of Kalasmpāda.Thereupon the king with his spouse again and again bowed untoVasishtha’s feet and informed him of what the Rākshasahad done under the guise of a Brāhmana. Hearing thewords of the king and being apprised that this vile act hadbeen done by the Rākshasa, Vasishtha said, 'O king, evenwhat I have said angrily shall not prove futile. HoweverI confer upon thee this boon that after twelve years thoushalt be freed from this curse, and by my favour thou shaltcherish no recollection of thy condition extending over thosetwelve years.' Having thus suffered the consequences ofthe curse, Saudāsa, the slayer of enemies, again obtained hiskingdom and governed his subjects. O descendant ofRāghu, the sacrificial ground of which thou hast asked me,belongs to the king Saudasa.\" Having thus heard thedreadful story of the king Saudāsa and saluted the asceticVālmiki, Satrughna entered a thatched cottage."

  "Uttara Kānda": "On the same night Satrughna housed himself in athatched cottage Sitā gave birth to twin sons. In the midnightthe Muni boys came to Vālmiki and communicated unto himthis auspicious intelligence, saying \"O illustrious Sir, thebeloved spouse of Rāma hath given birth to two sons; dothou so protect them that evil spirits might not injure them.\"Hearing those words the highly effulgent Vālmiki went thereand attained to great delight on beholding those two highlyeffulgent sons, resembling the newly risen sun and thecelestials. Thereupon he made arrangements against theoppression of ghosts and goblins. Thereupon taking Kusa (theupper part of the grass) and Lava (the lower part) the greatascetic Vālmiki made those arrangements. And givingKusa sanctified by Mantras unto the hands of elderly womenhe said, \"Do ye rub the person of the elder boy with these,\"and giving them Lava he said \"Do ye rub the person of theyounger brother with this. And according to this I shallname the first Son Kusa and the second Lava; and by thosenames they shall be celebrated on earth.\" Thereuponreverentially taking from the hands of Vālmiki and Kusa Lava, themeans of protection, the elderly ladies engaged in guardingthem. Hearing that Sitā without any trouble had given birthto two sons and elderly female ascetics had been engaged inprotecting them and hearing the chanting of Rāma's glories inthe midnight, Satrughna thought within himself. \"Blessed itis that Sitā hath given birth to two sons.\" And with this joythe live long night of Srābana passed away in no time.Having performed the morning rites after the expiration ofthe night and taken farewell from the ascetic Vālmiki,Lakshmana proceeded towards the west. And having spentseven nights he at last arrived at the hermitage of the piousRishis living on the banks of the Yamunā. Takingshelter there he engaged in pleasant conversation withChābanya and other ascetics. Having remained there forthe night and talked with those ascetics the high-souled,heroic Raghu prince Satrughna was greatly delighted."

Whatpersons before had been destroyed by this dart in conflict?\"Hearing the words of the high-souled descendant ofRaghu,—Satrughna, the highly effulgent Chābanya repliedsaying.—\"O descendant of Raghu, Lavana hath accomplished manyworks by this dart; amongst them, hear what Māndhāta,born in the race of Ikshwāku, did. The early king of Ayodhyāwas known over the three worlds under the name ofMāndhāta. He was the son of Yavanāshwa, highly powerful andstrong. Having brought the whole world under hissubjection the king Māndhāta engaged in the conquest of thecelestial region. He having been engaged in makingpreparations to conquer the world of gods—the celestial chiefIndra with other immortals was greatly terrified. With thispromise, the king Māndhāta went up into the celestial regionthat he would occupy the half of Indra’s throne and kingdomand the celestials would adore him. Being apprised of thisvicious intention of his, Indra, the slayer of Paka, consoledhim in sweet words, saying;—'O foremost of men, evenin the land of men, thou hast not been able to become thereal king. Without perfectly subjugating the earth howdost thou wish to lord over the celestial kingdom? If thewhole world is under thy subjection, O hero, be thou, withthe whole host of thy servants and soldiers, installed on thecelestial throne.' Indra having said this, the high-souledMāndhāta replied:—'O Sakra, who on this earth, hathdisobeyed my commands?' Whereto Indra replied 'O sinlessone, the night-ranger, Lavana, Madhu's son, living inMadhuvana, is not under thy control.' Hearing those dreadful andunpleasant words from Indra, the king lowered his head inshame and became silent. Thereupon, having welcomedIndra in that way, he left there and returned to earth. O slayerof enemies, with an angry heart, army and conveyance hewent to subjugate Madhu's son Lavana and sent an emissaryinviting him to battle. The ambassador, having gone there,addressed many unpleasant words unto Lavana and thenight-ranger devoured him. On the other hand finding the delay ofhis return the king Māndhāta, enraged, began to assail theRākshasa Lavana with arrows from all sides. Laughing wildlyLavana took up the dart in his hand and discharged it todestroy the king with his followers. Thereupon growingpowerful the dart reduced the king with his servants and armyinto ashes and returned to Lavana. In this wise thehigh-souled king Māndhāta, with his huge army, was slain. Ogentle hero, incomparable and great is the strength of thedart. Forsooth thou shalt slay Lavana next morning. Certainis thy victory if Lavana cannot take up his dart. Peopleshall be at ease if thou canst bring about the destruction ofLavana. O foremost of men, I shall then describe untothee the incomparable and dreadful prowess of thevicious-souled Lavana and his dart. O king, with great exertionsdid Lavana slay Māndhāta and not easily. O high-mindedone, next morning thou shalt surely destroy Lavana. Heshall issue out for flesh without taking his dart. And at thattime, O lord of men, thou shalt, for sooth, be crowned willvictory.\""

The clear morning having arrived, theheroic Lavana issued out of his city to collect food. In themeantime having crossed the river Yamunā, the heroicSatrughna, with bow in his hands, stood at the gate ofMadhu’s city. Thereupon returning in the noon with manythousand animals, the night-ranger Lavana, of dreadfulactions, espied Satrughna standing at the gate with a weaponin his hand. Thereupon he said:—\"What shall thou do withthis weapon? O vile wight, enraged I have devoured manythousand persons holding weapons like thee. I now perceivethou hast also been possessed by Kāla. O vile man, I amfully fed. How shall thou, of thy own accord, enter into mymouth?\" Lavana having said this again and again laughingthe great hero Satrughna shed tears in anger. Thehigh-minded Satrughna being beside himself with rage, from allhis person issued burning lustre. Greatly enraged he saidto the night-ranger \"O thou of a vicious intellect, I wish toenter into a duel encounter with thee. I am the son of thegreat king Daçaratha, brother of the intelligent Rāma and myname is Satrughna. I slay all my enemies and have come hereto destroy thee. I wish now to fight with thee—do thou enterinto a duel conflict. Thou art the enemy of all animals.Thou shall not be able to survive at my hands.\" He havingsaid this, the Rākshasa, laughing aloud, replied unto thatforemost of men;—\"Thy understanding is bewildered.By the influence of destiny thou hast come under my control.The Rākshasa Rāvana was the brother of my aunts, o thouof vicious understanding, O vile wight, it is for his wifethat Rāma did slay him. It is out of hatred that I havetolerated the destruction of Rāvana's family and havepardoned you all. You are all vile men; I have slain anddefeated all of your family that have passed away and shalldestroy all that are living and shall come into existence.O thou of vicious intellect, if thou wishest I shall fight withthee. Do thou wait here so long I do not bring myweapon. Do thou remain here as long as I with thatshall not kill thee.\" Whereto Satrughna immediatelyreplied \"Where shalt thou go while I am alive? Thepractical men should never let off the enemies who comeout of their own accord. He, who inviteth an enemy intobattle under the influence of perverted understanding isslain like a coward. Do thou behold this world of creaturesto thy hearts' content for I shall by various sharp weaponsdespatch thee to Yama's abode who is the enemy of the threeworlds and Rāghava.\""

And clashing his hands and grinding his teeth heinvited that foremost of Raghus, Satrughna, to fight. AndSatrughna, the slayer of celestial's enemies, said to thedreadful Lavana, giving vent to those words:—\"Satrughnawas not born when thou didst defeat other kings; do thoutherefore proceed to Death's abode being assailed by shafts.O thou of a vicious soul, as did the celestials behold Rāvanaslain so shall the Rishis and learned Brahmans behold thee,destroyed by me. O Rākshasa, forsooth shall good crowncities and villages when thou shalt fall down burnt by myarrows. As the rays of the sun enter into lotus so shallarrows, hard as lightning, discharged by my hands, shallenter into thy heart.\" Being beside himself with ire onhearing those words of Satrughna, Lavana threw a huge treeagainst his breast. And Satrughna too sundered it into ahundred pieces. Beholding his own action baffled theRākshasa again took up many trees and hurled them atSatrughna, who, with three or four hundred bent arrows, cutthem all, one by one, into pieces. Thereupon when thepowerful Satrughna assailed him with arrows the Rākshasawas not the least pained. Rather laughing aloud the valiantRākshasa uprooted a tree and struck him with that on thehead. With that stroke he was wounded and slain. Andthat hero falling there arose a terrible uproar amongst theRishis, celestials, Gandharvas and Apsarās. Thereuponconsidering Satrughna slain the night-ranger did not enterhis house albeit he got the opportunity; and moreoverbeholding him fallen and destroyed he did not take up his dart.He then began to carry his collected food. Regaining hissense within a moment, Satrughna, with a weapon in his hand,stood at the city gate and the Rishis began to praise him.Thereupon, he having taken up an excellent arrow ofunfailing aim the ten quarters were filled with its native brilliance.Its face was like lightning and its velocity the same and itlooked like Meru and Mandara; its joints were all bent.None could defeat it in battle. It was pasted with redsandal resembling blood and its feathers were beautiful.Beholding that dart like unto the fire of dissolution, anddreadful like unto the lords of Dānavas, mountains and Asuras,the creatures were greatly terrified. What more, beingdisturbed, the celestials, Asuras, Gandharvas, saints andApsarās and all other creatures of the world approached theGreat Patriarch, the conferrer of boons and said;—\"Thefear of the celestials and the destruction of the creatureshath arrived.\" Hearing those words the Patriarch Brahmareplied \"Although it is a source of great fear still it is notdreadful unto the celestials.\" Thereupon with sweet accentshe said:—\"Hear, O ye celestials, Satrughna hath taken upthis arrow for the destruction of Lavana. By the energythereof we have all been overwhelmed. This effulgent,ever-existing arrow was made by the Primeval DeityVishnu—the lord of creatures. My children, the burning arrow, ofwhich you are afraid, was made by the high-minded Vishnufor slaying the demons Madhu and Kaitabha. And Vishnualone is cognizant of its energy. This Satrughna is the firstportion of Vishnu’s person; do ye all go hence and behold thedestruction of the foremost Rākshasa, Lavana, by thehigh-souled, heroic Satrughna, the younger brother of Rāma.\"Hearing the words of the Patriarch Brahmā, the celestialsarrived at the battle-field of Satrughna and Lavana and sawthat the arrow, held by Satrughna’s hands, was burning likethe fire of dissolution. Beholding the welkin covered by thecelestials, Satrughna, the descendant of Raghu, emittingleonine roars, again and again looked towards Lavana. Andbeing again excited by the high-souled Satrughna andenraged Lavana arrived for encounter. Thereupon expandinghis bow up to ears, Satrughna, the most accomplishedarcher, discharged his arrow against the spacious breastof Lavana. And piercing his heart that arrow enteredspeedily into Rasātala And having entered Rasātala thatarrow, honored by the celestials, again came to the descendantof Raghu. And being pierced by that shaft thenight-ranger Lavana fell down on earth like a mountain clappedby a thunder-bolt. The Rākshasa being slain that celestial,huge arrow came into the possession of Rudra before thegods. Having removed the fear of the three worlds withone shaft, that heroic Raghu, Satrughna—younger brotherof Lakshmana, holding excellent bow and arrow, appearedlike the Sun of thousand rays removing darkness.Thereupon chanting the glories of Satrughna, the celestials, Rishis,Pannagas, Apsarās, said \"O son of Daçaratha, it is reallyfortunate, that thou, renouncing fear, hast acquired victoryand that the Rākshasa Lavana hath been vanquished like aserpent.\""

O thou having long arms, all those who canconfer boons have arrived here; they all wish for thyvictory; seeing us doth not go without fruits.\" Hearing thewords of the celestials the large-armed and self-controlledSatrughna placed his hands on his head and said.—\"Letthis picturesque and charming city of Madhu, built by thecelestials, be my capital; this is the only excellent boon Ican beg.\" The celestials, with a delighted heart, said to thedescendant of Raghu:—\"Thy desire shall be fulfilled andforsooth shall thy city be turned into a picturesque capital underthe name of Surashena.\" The high-souled celestials havingascended the welkin saying this, the highly effulgentSatrughna brought the soldiers there, that were encampedon the banks of the Ganges. When the soldiers arrived thereon hearing the commands of Satrughna he engaged inmaking encampments in the month of Srāban. In this wisethe fearlessness of the celestial host, taking the shape of acountry, that beautiful and picturesque city was reared inthe course of twelve years. All the fields there were filledwith crops and Indra began to pour showers in due season.And being protected by the strength of Satrughna's armsall men there became valiant and were freed from diseases.That city on the banks of Yamunā appeared beautiful likethe half moon and was filled with yards, shops, streetsbeautiful houses, men of four orders and various articles oftrade. Satrughna now engaged in beautifying the spacious,white houses that were made by Lavana before, with variousornamental works. Beholding the city interspersed with variousexcellent gardens, pleasure grounds and prosperously filledwith celestials and men and diverse articles of trade andmerchants hailing from various countries, Satrughna, the youngerbrother of Bharata, attained to the satisfaction of desire andexcess of delight. Having thus reared the beautiful cityhe resolved within himself \"The twelfth year has come. Ishall now behold the feet of Rāma.\" Thereupon having setup the city resembling the region of the celestials and filledwith various men, the king Satrughna, the enhancer ofRaghu's race, determined on beholding Rāma's feet."

Havingprevented his minister and leading generals he proceeded with onehundred chariots and cavalry. And having counted sevenhalting stations on his way, the highly illustrious descendant ofRaghu—Satrughna, arrived at the hermitage of Vālmiki. Andhaving bowed unto the feet of the leading Muni, that foremostof men took from his hands water to wash feet and Arghyaand accepted his hospitality. The great ascetic Vālmikiaddressed to the high-souled Satrughna many sweet words.Having referred at first to Lavana's destruction, hesaid:—\"Having slain Lavana thou hast performed a very hard work.O gentle one, O foremost of men, Lavana had slain in conflictmany hundred highly powerful kings with their army andconveyances. And thou hast easily slain that vicious-souledRākshasa, Lavana. By thy prowess the whole world hathbeen divested of fear. With great difficulty Rāma had slainRāvana—but without any trouble whatsoever thou hastaccomplished this mighty work. Lavana being slain, the celestialshave been greatly delighted—what more the well-being ofthe whole universe and all creatures has been brought about.O Rāghava, O foremost of men, being present in the assemblageof Vasava—I duly witnessed your combat. O Satrughna,I too have been greatly delighted—I therefore smell thy crownfor this is the best expression of love.\" Saying this thehigh-minded Vālmiki smelled his crown and made arrangements forhis reception as well as that of his followers. After meals,Satrughna, the foremost of men, listened to themesrelating to Rāma and set in musical notes. Those themeswere composed describing the early actions of Rāma.They were composed in Sanskrit, set to the tune of amusical instrument, adorned with all the marks of vocal musicand arranged in accompaniment with notes. Satrughna, theforemost of men, heard them from the beginning to the end,pregnant with truth and composed of those words. Andon hearing it he was beside himself with joy and his eyeswere full of tears. And remaining stunned for some timeand regaining his sense afterwards he began to breathe hardout of excess of surprise. He heard, in that song, of pastevents as things passing on. And hearing it, his followers,with their heads down and sorrowfully said:—\"Wonder,\" andsaying this they began to converse with oneanother:—\"Alas! Where are we? Is this a dream? We have beenhearing at this hermitage what we had not seen before. Whatwonder, that in a dream we hear such an excellent song.\"Being in this wise greatly surprised they said toSatrughna:—\"O foremost of men, do thou ask particularly, about this,Vālmiki, the foremost of ascetics.\" They being all thusstruck with curiosity, Satrughna said:—\"It is not proper forus, O Ye soldiers, to question him in this way. There are manysuch wonders in the hermitage of this ascetic. It is nottherefore becoming to ask him about this out of curiosity.\"Having thus addressed the soldiers and bowed unto theascetic, Satrughna, the desendant of Raghu, entered his ownquarter."

In sooth thehigh-minded Satrughna spent the night in no time listening tothat charming song set in musical notes. The night beingover, he first went through the morning rites and then withfolded hands addressed the foremost of ascetics, Vālmiki,saying:—\"O illustrious Sir, I am anxious to see Rāma, theenhancer of the delight of the Raghu race. And my desireis that thou mayst with other illustrious Rishis, grant mepermission on this.\" Satrughna, the slayer of enemies,having said this, the great ascetic Vālmiki embraced andbade him farewell. He was greatly anxious to behold Rāmaand saluting the foremost of Munis he speedily proceeded toAyodhyā. Thereupon having entered the highly picturesque cityAyodhyā, the graceful descendant of Ikshwākus, Satrughnareached where the long-armed and the highly effulgent Rāmawas waiting. He espied there Rāma in the midst of thecouncillors like Indra amongst the immortals burning in hisown effulgence. And having bowed with folded hands untoRāma, having truth for his prowess, Satrughna said:—\"Ogreat king, I have carried out all thine behests; I have slainthe vicious Lavana and filled his city with subjects. Odescendant of Raghu, twelve years have passed away withoutthee—I do not wish to live any longer separated from thee.Do thou therefore, O Kākuthstha of unmitigated prowess,have compassion on me. Without thee, I cannot live for everin a foreign province like a motherless child.\" He havingsaid this, Rāma embraced him and said:—\"Be not sorry,O hero. This is not a becoming action for Kshatriyas. Thekings, O Rāghava, are never tired of living in a foreignland. According to the morality of the Kshatriyas, theirgreatest duty consists in governing the subjects.

ThatBrahman, stricken with affection, again and again bewailedin various piteous accents, exclaiming \"What heinous crimehad I committed in my pristine birth that I have beenconstrained to witness the death of my son. My son, thouhast not as yet completed fourteen years. To my misery thouhast met with untimely death. Forsooth, for thy grief, Omy son, myself and thy mother shall soon be snatched awayby death. I do not remember to have ever uttered afalsehood, or injured an animal or perpetrated any other crime.Therefore for some other sinful action, this boy, withoutperforming the son's duties towards his parents, has goneto the abode of death. Save under the regime of Rāma,I have never seen or heard of the dreadful death of such aboy who hath not attained the age. Forsooth, Rāma hathperpetrated a mighty iniquity for which boys, during hisadministration, have been meeting with untimely death. Inother governments boys have no fear of such an untimelydeath. Therefore, O king confer life upon this dead child.Or else with my spouse I shall renounce my life at this gatelike one having no lord. O Rāma, soiled by the sinconsequent upon the destruction of a Brāhmana, do thou live longhappily with brothers. O thou of great prowess, up to thistime we have lived happily in thy kingdom. And now, ORāma, under thy subjection we are being troubled with thesorrow of our son's death. We have been brought underthe influence of Kāla; so in thy kingdom there is not theleast happiness for us. Having attained Rāma as its lord,the kingdom, of the high-souled Ikshwākus, hath attained tothe condition of one having no master, where during Rāma'sregime the death of a boy hath been brought about. Forbeing impiously governed by a king, for his sin, the subjectsmeet with calamities. And a king following evil tracks and notgoverning the subjects righteously people meet with untimelydeath. Therefore, when a king doth not suppress the crimescommitted by people either in cities or provinces the fear,of untimely death, comes in. Evident it is therefore thatundoubtedly the sin of the king hath appeared in cities andprovinces. And for that reason this boy hath met withdeath.\" Being overwhelmed with sorrow that old Brahmanagain and again remonstrated with the king in these piteouswords and afterwards covered the death body (of his son)."

Thereupon having enteredthe apartment in the company of Vasishtha, eight Brahmansblessed the king Rāma, resembling a celestial, saying \"Mayvictory crown thee.\" Mārkandeya, Maudgalya, Bāmadeva,Kashyapa, Kātyāyana, Javali, Gautama, and Narada—theseeight leading Brāhmanas having taken their seats, Rāma,with folded hands, saluted them. And he showed duecivilities towards his minister, citizens, Rishis and all others.Thereupon all the highly effulgent Rishis being accomodatedwith seats Rāma narrated duly before them the account ofthe Brāhmana and said. \"This Brahman is waiting at thePalace-gate.\" Hearing those words of the poorly king,Nārada, in the presence of all other Rishis, replied:—\"Hear,king, why this boy hath met with untimely death. Andhearing this, O descendant of Raghu, do thou settle whatthou thinkest proper. O king, in the golden age, only theBrahmans used to engage in asceticism. At that age, save theBrāhmanas no other caste used to lead the life of ananchoret. And for this, the Brahmans were the highest caste,effulgent in asceticism, shorn of ignorance, above death andconversant with three ages. Thereupon at the end of thegolden age, Brāhmana's understanding became loose andthe Tretā Yuga set in. At this age Kshatryas, gifted withthe power acquired by pristine asceticism, were born. Andthose men, intent upon austere penances, that were born inthe Tretā age, were more powerful and greater devotees thanthose in the former age. In the golden age the Brāhmanas weremore powerful than the Kshatryas. But in the Tretā age theBrāhmanas and the Kshatryas were equally powerful. Thusin the Tretā age, not beholding prominence of the Brāhmanasgreater than that of the Kshatryas, Manu and other religiousleaders of the time composed the Sastra describing andsetting in the four divisions of castes. In this wise the Tretāage was prolific with virtues of the four Varnas, and manypious sacrifices and was shorn of iniquities. Butbeing attacked a little with iniquity, one portion of sinappeared on earth. And growing impious people lost theirstrength. And for houses and farms that were the propertyof the former age, people of the Tretā Yuga were possessedby envy, the outcome of the quality of darkness. And with thefading of impiety on earth during Tretā, the soiled sin ofuntruth appeared. And this iniquity stretching one footstep,the lease of people's lives, for sins, became limited. Andthe sin of untruth descending on earth, people, to avoid theextinction of life in consequence thereof, became truthfuland engaged in many pious observances. During the Tretāage the Brāhmanas and Kshatryas engaged in austerepenances and the Vaisyas and Sudras engaged in servingthem. And the greatest piety of the Vaisyas and Sudrasat that time consisted of serving the Brāhmanas andKshatryas and specially for the Sudras the highest religionwas to serve people of all Varnas. O foremost of kings, atthe end of the Tretā age, Vaisyas and Sudras being fullyoverpowered by the sin of untruth, the Brāhmanas and theKshatryas also grew feeble. And the second foot ofimpiety being ushered into the world the Dwāpara ageset in. O foremost of men, during this age two legs ofpiety being cut off, impiety and untruth multiplied. And inYuga named Dwāpara the Vaisyas engaged in devoutpenances. In this wise in three ages the three Varnasgradually engaged in ascetic performances. The piety ofasceticism by Yugas gradually became established in threeVarnas. But, O foremost of men, in these three Yugas theSudras were not entitled to the virtues of devout penances.O foremost of men, the degraded caste—the Sudras, duringthy regime, have engaged in austere penances. And in theKali Yuga asceticism shall be established in the Sudras. Oking, even in the Dwāpara, devout penances for Sudras wereconsidered as impiety, what to speak of the Tretā age. Oking, one Sudra, under the influence of vicious understandinghas begun devout penances within thy kingdom. And forthat reason this boy hath met with death. Calamity sets inthat kingdom where a vicious-minded person commits aniniquity and that vicious wight and the king forsooth speedilyrepair to hell. The king, who piously governeth his subjects,receiveth the sixth portion of their study, asceticism and goodactions. While the king is entitled to the sixth portion ofeverything why should he not fully protect his subjects?Therefore, O chief of men, do thou bring all informations of thykingdom. And be then studious to repress vices whereverthou shalt find them. And by that, O foremost of men, thepiety of the subjects shall be increased, the lease of theirlife shall be prolonged and this boy shall regain his life.\""

Let this body be protected by sweet-scented oil so that itmight not be soiled by any means. See that it is notdisfigured, its joints are not loosened and the hairs do not falloff.\" The highly illustrious Rāma, the descendant ofIkshwākus, thus commanded Lakshmana, gifted withauspicious marks, and thought of his car and desired it to comesoon. Understanding his intention the golden car appearedbefore him in no time and saluting him said:—\"O thou oflong arms, thine chariot hath come.\" Hearing the sweetwords of Pushpaka the king Rāma saluted the great ascetics,ascended the car with his burning bow, quiver and daggerand left Bharata and Lakshmana in charge of the city. Andsearching that Sudra devotee here and there Rāghavaproceeded towards the west. And not beholding him therehe went to the North bounded by the Himalayas. And eventhere he did not espy the Sudra ascetic and even the smallestiniquity was not seen there. Thereupon returning from thatquarter the king journeyed the whole of east. And havingsat on the Pushpaka car he saw that the eastern quarterwas transparent like a looking glass and there was not thebest touch of sin. From the east Rāghava proceededtowards the south and espied a big tank by the side of theSaivala mountain. On the banks of that pond one asceticwas performing the most austere penances with his legsupwards and head downwards. Thereupon approachinghim, Rāma said—\"O thou of good vows, blessed art thou;I do ask thee, now, O thou highly effulgent and grown oldold in asceticism, in what Varna thou art born. I put thisquestion out of curiosity. I am the son of king Daçarathaand my name is Rāma. For what art thou going throughsuch hard austerities? Is it heaven or anything else thatthou prayest for? O ascetic, I wish to hear of the purposefor which thou art performing such hard penances. Art thoua Brahman, or an irrepresible Kshatriya or the third casteVaisya or a Sudra? Do thou speak the truth and thou shaftbe crowned with auspiciousness.\" Hearing the words ofRāma, the ascetic, whose face was downwards, gave out hisdegraded birth and communicated unto him for what hewas performing ascetic observances."

O Kākuthstha, I shallnever utter a falsehood since I am willing to conquer thethe region of gods. I am a Sudra and my name is Sambuka.\"The Sudra ascetic having said this, Rāma took out ofscabbard a beautiful sharp sword and chopped off his headtherewith. And that Sudra being slain, Indra, Agni andother celestials praised him again and again and showeredflowers. And being greatly delighted, the celestials said toRāma, having truth for his prowess:—\"O thou of a greatmind, thou hast nicely performed this god-like work.O slayer of foes, do thou now crave a boon. Odescendant of Raghu, being slain by thee this Sudrahath been able to attain to the abode of thecelestials.\" Hearing the words of the deities, Rāma, havingtruth for his prowess, said with folded hands to Purandara,of a thousand eyes:—\"If the celestials are pleased, I beg forthis boon that the son of the twice-born one may be restoredto life. Do ye confer upon me this boon; this is mywished-for object. It is for my iniquitous conduct that this only son ofthe Brahman hath met with untimely death. Do ye restorehim to life. I have promised before that leading twice-bornone that I would restore his son to life—do ye therefore,make not me a liar.\" Hearing the words of Rāma theleading celestials delightedly said:—\"Do thou return, OKākutstha. The Brahmin boy shall immediately gain backhis life and be united with his father, mother and friends.O Rāghava, with the death of the Sudra the boy has regainedhis life. Be thou at ease; may good betide thee. Oforemost of men, we, too, return with delighted hearts.O Rāghava, we desire to behold the hermitage of the greatsaint Agastya. Having been initiated, that highly effulgentBrahman saint hath lived within waters for twelve years;his vow hath now terminated. O Kākuthstha, we shall nowgo to welcome that Muni. Do thou also follow us to seethat saint.\" Saying \"So be it!\" to the words of the celestialsthat descendant of Raghu ascended his golden car Pushpaka.And having ascended spacious cars the celestials proceededto the hermitage of Agastya born of a Kumbha. Rāmatoo also followed them. Thereupon beholding the celestialspresent the virtuous-souled Agastya, the jewel of asceticism,welcomed them particularly. Having accepted his worshipand adored in return that great Muni, the immortals, delighted,proceeded to their abodes with their followers. The celestialshaving departed Rāma descended from Pushpaka andsaluted that effulgent and foremost of Rishis Agastya. Andhaving received due hospitality he sat there. Thereuponthe highly effulgent and leading ascetic Kumbhajonisaid:—\"O Rāghava, I have been greatly delighted with thy coming.By my good fortune I have seen thee to-day. O Rāma,I love thee because thou art gifted with many qualities.O king, thou art my worshipful guest. I was thinking of thee.The celestials informed me that thou wert coming havingslain the Sudra ascetic. Thou hast observed piety and hastgiven back life unto the dead child of the Brahman. Dothou spend this night with me, O Rāghava. Thou art thegraceful Nārāyana. In thee the whole universe isestablished. Thou art the lord of all creatures and the eternalPurusha. Thou shalt go to thy city next morning in thyPushpaka car. This ornament, O gentle one, hath beenmade by the architect of the celestials; its make is verybeautiful and it is dazzling by its own lustre. By acceptingthis, O Kākutstha, do thou satisfy my desire. It is said thatone attains to best fruits if he makes present unto his deity,of best articles he gets from another. Thou art the onlyworthy person to use this ornament. Thou art alone capableof conferring best fruits. Thou dost protect Indra and othercelestials. Therefore I do duly present thee with thisornament. O king, do thou accept it.\" Thereuponmeditating upon the duties of the Kshatryas, the heroic Rāma, theforemost of the intelligent, said:—\"O illustrious Sir, theBrāhmanas only can accept presents—how can the Kshatryasdo? To take gifts is the function of the Brāhmanas—forKshatryas it is a source of censure. Besides, to receivepresents from a Brāhmana, is highly culpable. Do thoutherefore tell me, how I may accept this ornament.\"Hearing the words of Rāma, the great saint Agastya repliedsaying:—\"O Rāma, O son of Daçaratha, at the beginningof the golden age, people had no king; but Vāsava was the rulerof the celestials. Therefore to obtain a king, men approachedBrahmā, the god of gods and said 'O deity thou hast placedIndra as ruler over the celestials; therefore, O lord ofcreatures, do thou also confer upon us a king who shall beforemost among men; by worshipping him we shall be freedfrom all sins. We shall not live without the king—eventhis is our firm resolution.' Thereupon the PatriarchBrahmā sent for Indra and other deities and said:—'Do yeall give a portion of your respective energies.' Thereuponthe deities gave each a portion of their own energies.Thereupon Brahma made a Khshupa or sound and therefromoriginated a king under the name of Khshupa. And inhis person Brahmā placed in equal proportions the energiesof the deities. Thereafter he made Khshupa the foremostking of men. By virtue of the portion of Indra's energythe king Khshupa brought the earth under his control; bythat of Varuna’s energy he fostered his own body; by Kuvera’sportion he conferred riches upon his subjects; and by thatof Yama he governed them. Therefore, O Rāma, by virtueof Indra's portion, do thou accept this ornament and conferupon me the salvation.\" Hearing the words of the Muni, Rāmatook from him that brilliant celestial ornament burning likethe rays of the Sun. And having taken that excellentornament, Dāçarathi asked the great saint Kumbhayoni,saying:—\"Whence hast thou obtained this celestial ornamentof a wondrous make? Who hast given thee this?Brahman, I do accost thee thus out of curiosity. Thouart the mine of many wonders.\" Whereto Agastya replied,saying \"Hearken, O Rāma, how I did obtain this ornamentin the Tretā age.\""

Onceon a time I began to roam all over the forest being willingto see well every nook and corner of it. And I saw thatit was impossible to ascertain how very pleasant that forestwas. In every place there were trees with profuse sweetfruits and roots. In the middle I espied a pond extendingover a Yojana. There was no moss in that deep, calm,clear and sweet water; there were lotuses and lilies andswans, Kārandāvas, Chakravakas and many other waterfowls were playing in the waters. O lord of creatures, at nodistance from that pond I saw an old, holy hermitage butthere was no creature or animal around it. It was summerand I spent that night in that hermitage. Nextmorning leaving my bed I arrived at the banksof the pond and saw a plump dead body in the waters.None of its limbs was pale and its beauty was not spoiled.Beholding it and standing on the banks I began to meditateupon it. And thought I 'What is this?' In a moment Iespied a beautiful car, swift-coursing like the mind anddrawn by ganders. And I saw in that chariot a celestialperson. He was being attended by Apasaras adorned withcelestial ornaments and having lotus-eyes. Some of themwere singing, some dancing and some playing on Mridanga,Vina and other musical instruments and some were fanninghis lotus-like countenance with valuable, golden chowries,dazzling like the rays of the moon. O Rāma, the foremostof Raghu’s race, like unto the moon renouncing the summitof the Sumeru mount that celestial wight got down fromhis seat in the car and engaged in devouring the dead body.And having taken enough flesh he got down into waters andduly performed ablution. And thereafter that heavenlybeing again addressed himself for ascending the car. Oforemost of men, beholding that heavenly being about toget up I accosted him, saying ‘Who art thou? I see, thou hasta celestial form, then why hast thou taken such anabominable food? O thou adored of the immortals, persons likethee should not take such meals. O gentle one, I have beenstriken with great curiosity and wish to hear all.

Thereflourished in the days of yore a highly illustrious andpowerful Vidarbha king under the name of Sudeva knownover three worlds. He was my father. His two queens gavebirth to two sons. My name is Sweta and the name of myyoungest brother was Suratha. After the decease of my sirethe subjects installed me on the throne and I governed thempiously and carefully for a thousand years. By some reasonI was informed of the extent of my life. And when Iperceived that the lease of my life had well-nigh expiredI entered into the life of Banaprasta. And having placedmy brother Suratha on the throne I entered into a denseforest devoid of men and animals at no distance from thispond to perform devout penances. And I performedausterities for a long time near this pond. Having performedhard penances in this forest, for three thousand years I atlast attained to the region of Brahmā. And albeit I hadreached the Brahmā region I was still being assailed byhunger and thirst. And gradually I grew tired therewith.Thereupon approaching the patriarch Brahmā, the lord ofthree worlds, I said:—\"O Brahmā, here there is no hungeror thirst; still why have I been brought to their control?Of what iniquity of mine is this fruit? O deity, tell meupon what I shall live?\" Whereto the patriarchreplied;—\"O son of Sudeva, do thou live upon sweet savoured meateveryday? O Sweta, thou didst only look to the growth ofthy person when thou didst perform rigid penances. O thouof a great mind, nothing grows, when nothing is sown.Thou didst only perform ascetic penances, but thou didst notmake any gift of charity. It is for that reason, O my son,that thou art, even in heaven, being assailed by hunger andthirst. Thereupon do thou now live upon thine own dead bodyfostered by various food. By this thou shalt keep up thybeing. O Sweta, thou shalt be relieved from this afflictionwhen the irrepressible, great Saint Agastya shall reach thatforest. O gentle one, even unto the immortals he can givesalvation; what wonder it is that he shall relieve thee fromthe miseries of hunger and thirst.\" O foremost oftwice-born ones, from the time of hearing those words of the greatBrahmā, the god of gods, I have been engaged in this cursedwork of feeding upon my own dead body. O Brahman,for many long years I have been living upon this corpsestill I have not done with it. O Saint, I, too, derivesatisfaction from it; I now understand that thou art the illustriousAgastya born of a Kumbha; for none else is capable ofcoming here; do thou therefore save me from this pain, whoam afflicted with great miseries. O foremost of twice-bornones, O gentle one, do thou take this ornament; may good betidethee. Do thou be propitiated with me. O Brahman, I doconfer upon thee, gold, riches various clothes, eatables,excellent ornaments and diverse other objects of desire andenjoyment. O foremost of Munis, do thou with compassionsave me.' Hearing those words of the heavenly being,exciting pity, I accepted this ornament for saving him. Andas soon as I took this ornament that human body of theroyal saint disappeared. And the body being dissolved, theroyal saint Sweta, greatly delighted, happily went to theland of immortals.

And howdid he proceed to that forest devoid of men and animalsfor undergoing penances? I wish to hear the truth.\"Hearing the words of Rāma stricken with curiosity, the highlyeffulgent saint Agastya said:—\"O Rāma, formerly in thegolden age, Manu was the king. His son was Ikshwāku.Having installed the irrepressible Ikshwāku, Manu said:'Be thou the lord over creatures.' Saying 'So be it' Ikshwākuaccepted the command.

Thoushalt govern the subjects meting out proper punishmentunto them, but do not punish them without any fault. Ifthe punishment, which a king inflicts upon the guilty, bejust it becomes the instrumental in taking the giver toheaven. Therefore, O my son having large arms, be particularlystudious as regards punishment for thereby thou shaltacquire great piety.' Having in this wise advised IkshwākuManu delightedly repaired to the region of Brahmā. AfterManu's departure, the effulgent Ikshwāku thought of themeans for creating progeny. Thereupon performing manypious rites Manu's son engendered a hundred sons. Odescendant of Raghu, the youngest of all those sons becamestupid and ignorant and did not respect his elder brothers.And thinking that he should therefore be punished henamed this son 'Danda.' Thereupon finding no otherprovince worthy of Danda he allotted the region betweenVindhya and Saivala to him. Danda became king of thatpicturesque valley. And having reared a fine city there henamed it as Madhumanta and appointed Sukracharja offirm vows as his priest. Having thus established his kingdom,Danda, with his priest, began to lord over it filled withhealthy and delighted people like unto the lord of celestialsin their region. O Rāma, like unto Mahendra governinghis kingdom of heaven under the guidance of Vrihaspati,the preceptor of celestials, Danda, the grand-son of Manu,governed his own kingdom with the help of Usanās.\""

That dreadful burningthunderbolt, like unto the fire of dissolution, falling on Vitra'shead, the three Worlds were agitated. Thereupon thinkingthat he has perpetrated an iniquity by slaying Vitra engagedin asceticism, Indra, out of fear, fled to the other side ofLokaloka, perpetually enshrowded with darkness. And thesin, consequent upon the destruction of a Brahman, pursuinghim vehemently, entered into his person. In this wise Indrabecame subject to dreadful afflictions. Beholding the enemyslain and Indra fled, the deities headed by fire again andagain chanted the glories of Vishnu—the lord of threeworlds, saying 'O great god, thou art the refuge of thethree worlds. Thou art the first-born and the father of theuniverse. For protecting all creatures thou hast assumedthis Vishnu form. Thou hast slain this Vitra but the sin ofslaying a Brahman has visited Indra. Therefore, O excellentPurusha, do thou so arrange that he may be freed from sins.'Hearing the words of the celestials Vishnu said—'Let yourChief celebrate a sacrifice in my honor—and by that he shallbe cleansed of the sin. If the slayer of Pāka celebrates ahorse sacrifice, he shall again fearlessly be installed as thechief of deities.' Having addressed these nectar-like wordsto the deities and being glorified by them, Vishnu, the god ofgods, returned to his abode.\""

  "Uttara Kānda": "Having thus described at length and finished the storyof Vitra's destruction Lakshmana said:—\"The mighty Vitra,the terror of the deities, being slain, and the slayer Indra,being assailed by the sin of Brahmanicide, was bewilderedand at a loss to ascertain his duty. Being at his wit's endhe repaired to the other side of the Lokaloka mountain andremained there for some time like a coiled serpent. Andagain in consequence of Indra's separation, the whole worldwas agitated, the forests grew dried and the earth wasdevoid of water. On account of the rivers being dried up andwant of rain all creatures grew impatient. In this wise, thetime of the destruction of creatures having arrived, thecelestials being stricken with anxiety, according to theprevious command of Vishnu, engaged in celebrating thesacrifice With Rishis and Ritwikas they fearfullyapproached Purandara; and beholding him assailed by the sin ofBrahmanicide, they with him, at their head, engaged incelebrating a horse-sacrifice. After the sacrifice thesin issued out of Indra's person and addressing thehigh-souled deities said 'Do ye all ascertain, where I shall gonow.' Thereupon highly pleased the deities replied:—'Dothou divide thyself into four portions.' Hearing the words ofthe high-souled celestials she divided herself into four parts,and wishing for a separate habitation said:—'By one portion,I shall at my pleasure, live in rivers full of water duringrains and shall obstruct people from going there. By mysecond portion I shall live perpetually on lands as Ushara;98I tell you the truth. By my third portion I shall for threenights every month live in youthful women proud of theiryouth—so that men might not live with them. And by myfourth portion I shall enter into the persons of those whoshall slay innocent Brāhmanas.' Hearing those words thedeities said 'What thou hast said shall be carried out. Dowhat thou wishest.' Thereupon the celestials, delighted,adored their Chief divested of sins and crowned with victory.And Vāsava being installed again on the throne, the wholeuniverse was at rest. Thereupon Indra worshipped Vishnuin the shape of that wonderful sacrifice. O descendant ofRaghu, such is the power of a horse-sacrifice.\" Hearing thecharming words of Lakshmana, the energetic and high-souledking, Rāma, powerful like Indra, was greatly delighted."

  "Uttara Kānda": "Hearing the words of Lakshmana and smiling, thehighly effulgent descendant of Raghu, Rāma, skilled in theart of speech, replied:—\"Lakshmana, O foremost of men,thou hast truly related the story of Vitra's destruction andthe fruits of horse-sacrifice. O gentle one, I have heard,that formerly in the province of Valheeka, the graceful kingIla, the son of the patriarch Kardama, was highly pious. Oforemost of men, having brought the entire earth under hiscontrol, the highly illustrious king Ila used to govern hissubjects like unto his own sons. O descendant of Raghu,being terrified, the generous deities, the rich Daityas, thehighly powerful Nāgas, the irrepressible Rākshasas,Gandharvas and Yakshas used to adore him perpetually. Thehigh-souled Ila being enraged, the three worlds used to beconvulsed with terror. And albeit so very powerful thehighly illustrious king of Valheeka never swerved from thepath of morality nor neglected his deities and ratherintelligently used to administer all business. Once on a time inthe picturesque season of spring the mighty-armed Ila, withhis army and conveyances, entered into a charming forest,and on the pretext of hunting, slew hundreds and thousandsof deer. With slaying deer only the high-souled kingwas not satisfied. He slew millions of diverse otheranimals. In this way being engaged in hunting theking Ila arrived where Kartikeya was born. At that time, inthat hilly fountain there was sporting in the company of hisfollowers, the irrepressible god of gods, the three-eyed deitywith the daughter of the Chief of mountains. Being desirousof satisfying the goddess Umā, her lord, whose emblem isbull, was sporting under the guise of a female. In that forestland, all male animals or trees were metamorphosed intothe other sex at that time. A-hunting, the king Ila, the sonof Kardama, arrived at that place and saw all animals and treeschanged into female forms. And immediately the king,and his army were changed into similar forms. Findinghimself in that plight the king Ila was greatly sorry, and thinkingthat the misfortune was owing to the influence of the godof gods—Umā's lord, he was greatly terrified. Thereuponwith his followers and army the king took shelter of thehigh-souled and red-throated deity. Thereupon the great god,the conferrer of boons, with the goddess, smilingsaid:—'Rise up, O son of Kardama, O thou of great strength, Ogentle one, do thou beg of me any other boon than that ofobtaining thy manhood.' Being thus disappointed by thegreat deity, the king Ila, metamorposed into a female, becamegreatly sorry and did not pray for any other boon. Beingstricken with great sorrow, the king, with whole heart, salutedthe daughter of the mountain-chief and said:—'O goddess,thou art the protectress of all—thou dost confer boons on all;seeing thee doth not become fruitless. Do thou thereforehave compassion on me.' Thereupon, cognizant of thatking's intention, the goddess, with Hara's consent,said:—'Half of the boon, that thou shalt beg of us both, shall begranted by Mahadeva, and the other half shall be granted byme. Do thou therefore beg of me the half.' Hearing ofthat excellent and wondrous boon the king became greatlydelighted and said:—'If thou art pleased with me, Ogoddess, do thou confer upon me this boon, that I may be forone month, a female gifted with wonderful beauty in thethree worlds and for another month I may be a male.'Thereupon understanding king's desire, the beautiful goddessPārvati, mercifully said:—'The boon, according to thydesire, shall be granted. O king, when thou shalt attainto the male figure, thou shalt not remember anything of thyfemale form. And when thou shalt assume the charmingfemale figure thou shalt forget everything of thy male state.'O Lakshmana, by virtue of this boon, the king Ila for onemonth used to become a man and for the next used tobecome a female, charming in the three worlds under the nameof Ilā.\""

And withfolded hands they, requesting the noble king Rāma for furtherparticulars, said:—\"How could the king Ila subject himselfto those afflictions in the shape of a female? And how did heuse to behave himself in his male form?\" Hearing those wordsbegotten of curiosity, Rāma engaged in relating the whole storyas he had heard before, saying:—\"In the first month,assuming his female form having lotus-eyes and charming the threeworld, he used to sport in the forest abounding in groves, inthe company of his companions metamorphosed into thesame form. Having sent away all his conveyances he usedto sport in the mountain vale. Thus roaming, Ilā one dayespied Budha, a bundle of rays, resembling the full moon ina picturesque pond filled with birds at some distance from themountain. Having compassion for all creatures Budha, atthat time, was performing, hard, glorious and wished-forausterities within waters. O son of Raghu, on beholding himIlā was greatly surprised, and with her female companionsbegan to agitate waters. As soon as Budha saw her he wasassailed by the arrows of Cupid. Not being able to controlhimself he grew impatient within waters and thought “Thisdamsel is far more beautiful even than the celestial girls.I have never seen before a like beauty amongst the celestials,Nāgas, Asuras and Apsarās. If she has not been marriedbefore then she is my worthy spouse.\" With this resolutionBudha got up from the waters, and repairing to his hermitage,sent for the fair ones. They all saluted him. Thereuponthe virtuous-souled Budha accosted them saying:—\"Whosedaughter is this graceful girl amongst you and for what shehas come here? Do not delay—tell me soon.\" Hearingthose sweet words of his, the females said:—\"This fair damselis our supreme lady. She has no husband. Journeying shehas come here with us.\" Hearing those plain words, Budhathought of the learning by which one can perceive everything.And being informed of all regarding the king Ila thereby hesaid—\"Do ye all live in this mountain being Kimpurusas; doye make your respective habitations here. I shall give youalways fruits and roots. O ye females, you shall have allKimpurusas as your husbands.\" According to the words ofBudha they lived in that mountain as Kimpurusas. In thiswise many Kimpurusa-Budhas were procreated."

O son of Soma, thou maystcommand me whatever thou wishest.\" Hearing thosewondrous words, the son of moon, possessed by lust, began to livewith her. And living in the company of Ilā, having agraceful countenance, Budha, possessed by desire, spent the entiremonth of Madhu like a moment. Thereupon after the expiryof a month, the graceful king Ila, son of the pariarch, awokefrom sleep and beholding Budha, the son of Soma, engagedin austerities with uplifted hands in the midst of waters,said:—\"O illustrious Sir, with my followers I entered thisdense forest—I do not see them now anywhere. Where havethey gone?\" Hearing the words of the royal saint, who hadlost all recollection, Budha, with sweet words consoled himand said:—\"All thy followers have been destroyed by adownpour of huge rocks; thyself, being afraid of the storm,was also asleep in the hermitage. Thou hast no fear now.Therefore, O hero, being consoled and renouncing all anxietydo thou live here happily living upon fruits and roots.\"Being comforted by those words, the high-minded king Ila,striken with distress in consequence of the destruction ofhis servants, poorly replied:—\"O Brahman, I shall renouncemy own kingdom. Separated from my servants, I shall notbe able to live, even for a moment. Do thou give mepermission in this. O Brahman, my eldest son, the highlyillustrious Sasabindu, the foremost of the pious, shall be theowner of my kingdom. O Brahman, renouncing my servantsand wives of the country I shall not be able to wait here.Therefore, O highly effulgent one, do thou not give me suchan unpleasant command of remaining here.\" Hearing thosewonderful words of the king Ila, Budha consoling him,said:—\"Do thou wait here. Be not aggrieved, O highlypowerful son of Kardama. If thou dost live here for a year,I shall render thy well-being.\" Hearing the words of Budha,of unwearied actions, the king Ila desired to live there.Thereupon becoming a man for the next month he beganto perform ascetic penances. Thereupon in the ninth month,Ilā, having a beautiful waist, gave birth to a highly effulgentson, under the name of Pururavā, born of the loins of Budha,and equally graceful like him. And she handed over thehighly powerful son unto his father Budha. Thereupon aftera year Ila having regained the male form, Budha by meansof various words afforded delight unto him."

Pulastya, Kratu, Vashatkar andthe highly effulgent Omkāra came there following him.Being greatly delighted for their arrival they all gave outtheir individual opinion for bringing about the well-being ofthe king of Vālhakee. For the welfare of his son, the patriarchKardama said:—'Hear, O twice-born ones, how thewell-being of the king Ila may be secured. For this disease Ido not find any other good medicine but Umā's lord. Andsave Aswamedha there is no other sacrifice more favouriteunto the high-souled deity.

Tell me now, what I can do for this king ofValheeka.' Hearing the words of Mahādeva, the Brāhmanas,having propitiated him with great devotion, prayed for Ila'smanhood.

Sitā has becoming willing togive testimony (of her purity) for removing the calumny ofthe public; do thou mercifully give her permission in this.I tell you the truth, O Rāma, that these irrepressible twinbrothers are your sons, O descendant of Raghu. I amthe tenth son of Pracheta, so, far from speaking untruthit does not even spring up in my mind. I thereforeknow the truth that these twins are thy sons. I haveperformed austere penances for many thousand years; I nowswear before thee, that if this Maithili is found touchedby any sin I shall not reap the fruit of my ascetic observancesextending over many thousand years. I have neverperpetrated before a crime, either in my mind, body, or speech.If Maithili is found divested of sin I may then partake ofthe fruits of piety. O descendant of Raghu, finding Sitāpure in mind and five elements of body I took her near thespring in the forest. Besides this Sitā, of pure ways, divestedof sins and ever considering her husband as deity, shall givetestimony this day. Thou hast been afraid of the publiccalumny. O son of a king, thy mind being possessed by thefear of public scandal, thou didst renounce this Sitā of a purecharacter and always regarding her husband as a god; Icame to know this by virtue of my discriminative knowledge.\""

By thy wordsshorn of sin, I have been convinced that Jānaki is of pureways. Still, O Brahman, what thou hast commanded shallbe carried out; let Sitā produce testimony of the purity ofher character. Because Vaidehi formerly underwent a trialin the city of Lanka before the celestials I brought her home.O Brahman, vilification of the people is very powerful.Although I know that Jānaki has not been touched by anysin still I have renounced her. Do thou therefore forgiveme. I know that these twin brothers Kusa and Lava aremy sons. Yet if Jānaki gives evidence of her own puritybefore the assembly I shall be greatly satisfied.\" Beingapprised of Rāma’s intention as to Sitā’s trial the celestialsall came there on the occasion. The Adityas, Vasus, Rudras,Viswadevas, Maruts, Sadhyas, Siddhas, Nagas and Rishisplacing Brahmā before them, all came there. And beholdingthe celestials and Rishis assembled there Rāma again said toVālmiki:—\"O foremost of Munis, the words of thehigh-souled Rishis, are divested of sin; therefore on thy wordsonly I shall consider Sitā as having pure ways. Still all havecome here being anxious to witness Sitā’s trial. I shalltherefore be greatly delighted if Jānaki gives in before themany testimony of her pure character.\" As soon as thosewords were uttered, sweet, fragrant, cold air, the witness ofvirtue and vice, blowing mildly, excited the joy of theassembly. People, hailing from various countries, with all attentionbegan to witness this wondrous and unthought of event.In the golden age only the celestial wind used to blow—andit now blew even in the Treta Yuga and forsooth it was amatter of exceeding surprise. Thereupon beholding allpeople assembled there, Janaka's daughter, wearing a redcloth, with her face and looks downwards and folded palmssaid:—\"I have never thought of any other person in mymind but Rāma; by the strength of this virtue let thegoddess Vasundharā give me room. I have always with mymind, body and words prayed for Rāma’s well-being and byvirtue hereof may the goddess Vasundharā give me roomin her womb.\" As soon as Sitā swore in this wise awonderful incident took place. From inside the earth a celestialand excellent throne rose up. It was carried on head by theNāgas of unmitigated prowess, having celestial persons andadorned with celestial jewels and ornaments. Havingstretched out her arms and taken Maithili, the goddess earthwelcomed her and placed her on the throne. And whileseated on the throne she was entering the earth, she wascovered with the continued showers of celestial flowers.Eulogising her at that time, the celestials said \"Oh! highlypraiseworthy is thy conduct, O Sitā.\" Being present in thewelkin and beholding Sitā enter into the Earth, the celestialsagain and again eulogised her in various words. The Rishis,kings and other leading men present in the sacrificial arenarepeatedly expressed their surprise. Beholding Sitā's censurethus removed all animals, animate or inanimate, either onearth or in the sky, were greatly delighted. Some cried aloudin joy, some remained silent, and some motionless espiedRāma or Sitā. In this wise beholding Sitā's entrance intothe Earth the ascetics were greatly delighted. They allattaining to the same state of mind, the whole universe, fora moment, was possessed with the state of equality."

And being possessed by grief and anger and sheddingtears he wept for some time and then said:—\"My mind isabout to be possessed by grief, which I had never experiencedbefore, for in the very presence of mine the graceful Jānaki,like Lakshmi herself, hath disappeared from view. Formerly,in my absence, Jānaki was once carried away into the cityof Lankā, on the other side of the great ocean and I broughther back; what wonder it is that I shall get her back fromPatāla? O goddess Vasudha, do thou soon bring Sitā inmy view, or else, worked up with ire I shall give thee thefruits of thy negligence. Thou art my mother-in-law, sincethe royal saint Janaka obtained Sitā from thy womb whilecultivating thee with plough share. Do thou therefore bringback my Sitā or give me a region of the celestials, I wish tolive with Sitā. I am beside myself for her: do thou thereforebring back Sitā. If thou dost not render back Sitā unto meO Vasudha, I shall deluge the earth with waters, havingassailed, destroyed and drowned into water thy hugecompass with mountains and forests.\" Rāma, having given ventto those accents under the influence of ire, the patriarchBrahmā, with the consent of the celestials, said:—\"O Rāmaof firm vows, O slayer of enemies, thou shouldst not grievethus. Recollect thy former state of Vishnu and the counsels.I would not have reminded thee of this secret but for thepresent necessity. Do thou now once more remember thybirth from Vishnu. By nature, Sitā is pure, chaste and everdependent upon thee. And by virtue of her asceticdependance upon thee she has gone to the region of Nāgas. Thoushalt again meet her in heaven. Hear, what I communicate untothee before the assembly. Thou shalt be informed ofeverything by listening to this excellent poem describing thy ownactions, O hero. Vālmiki has described herein all miseries andjoys thou hast experienced since thy birth and what shallhappen in future after Sitā's entrance into Patala. O Rāma,this first epic poem, Rāmayan, has been composed describingthy works. None but thee is worthy of the fame of thispoem. O Rāghava, O highly illustrious one, do thou hear withthe Rishis, Uttarakandam, the last portion of this poem. Odescendant of Raghu, this is not worthy of being heard by anybut those who art the foremost of the royal saints.\" Havingsaid this, the deity Brahmā, the lord of the three worlds, withother deities, repaired to the region of immortals. Thehigh-souled and the highly effulgent ascetics, living in Brahmā'sregion, who were present in the assembly, obtaining Brahmā'spermission, waited there, to hear Rāma's future career in theUttarakandam. Hearing the words of the great Patriarchinstinct with well-being, the highly effulgent Rāma said toVālmiki:—\"O illustrious sir, the Rishis living in Brahmā'sregion have grown desirous of hearing my future history.So let it be taken up next morning.\" Having thus settledand taken with him Kusa and Lava and sent away theassembled people he entered his palace and spent the nightmourning for Sitā."

Andbeing under his subjection, bears, monkeys, Rākshasas andkings always afforded delight unto him. On account ofshowers in proper time there was enough of food in hiskingdom. The quarters were pure and delightful. Thecitizens and villagers were happy and healthy. Nonemet with premature death. In fact, in his regime allcalamities were removed. Thereupon after many years, theillustrious Kausalya, Rāma’s mother, surrounded by her sonsand grand-sons, breathed her last. Performing manypious observances Kakeyi followed her and obtained peacein the land of immortals. Those noble ladies, being unitedwith the king Daçaratha, in heaven, were greatly delightedand obtained all virtues.

Havingheard of the coming of Bharata the highly powerfulGandharvas gathered round and sent up leonine roars.Thereupon began the battle capable of making down erect andcontinued for a week. On neither side there was victoryor defeat. On all sides there flowed streams of bloodand there were afloat human bodies. Daggers, Saktis andbows were like the banks of the river. Thereupon enragedBharata, Rāma's younger brother, discharged a dreadfularrow named Sangharata resembling the fire of dissolutionagainst Gandharvas. Having bound them all with the nooseof death and sundered them with Sangharata, Bharatadespatched all the Gandharvas to the abode of death. Eventhe celestials could not recollect if such a dreadful encounterhad happened before. In a moment the huge Gandharvahost was slain.

Apprisedof Rāma's determination of going to heaven, monkeys, bornof the celestials, Rishis and Gandharvas taking Sugrivabefore them, came there to see Rāma. And they allsaid:—\"O Rāma, O foremost of men, if thou dost repair to heavenforsaking us all, it will be hurling Yama's rod upon us.\" Thehighly powerful Sugriva too saluting Rāma said:—\"O lordof men, having placed Angada on the throne I have comehither. I have determined upon following thee, O King.\"Hearing the words of monkeys, Rāma said that their desirewould be fulfilled. He then said to Bibhishana the king ofRākshasas:—\"As long as people shall breathe, O Bibhishana,O highly powerful lord of Rākshasas, thou shalt preservethy body in Lankā. As long as the moon, the sun and theearth shall exist and as long as my story shall remain current,thy kingdom shall be in existence. Thou didst, out offriendship, carry out my behests and perform my works. Dothou piously govern thy subjects. I should not speak anything else. What shall I say more unto thee, O highlypowerful lord of Rākshasas. Worship Jagannath (the lord ofthe world), the presiding deity of the Ikshwāku race.\"Having thus addressed the king of Rākshasas alwaysobeying Rāghava's command, Kākuthstha said toHanumān:—\"It is settled that thou shalt live forever, do thou,now observe thy promise. As long as my history shall runcurrent in this world do thou at my command live happily.\"Being thus addressed by the high-souled Rāghava Hanumānattained to great delight and said:—\"As long as the sacredtheme shall pass current in this world I shall live herecarrying out thy commands.\" Thereupon he said to theJambhuvan, Brahmā's son, Mainda, Dwivida and five othersin his company:—\"As long as the Kali Yuga exists doye all live.\" Having thus addressed them all Kākuthsthasaid to bears and monkeys, \"Do ye come all with me.\""

  "Uttara Kānda": "After the night had expired the highly illustriousRāma having a spacious breast and eyes like lotus petals saidto the priest:—\"Let the brilliant umbrellas Agnihotra, andBājapeya go with the Brāhmanas before, which look well inthe great road.\" Thereupon the highly effulgent Vasishthaarranged duly all the ceremonies necessary for going to thenext world. Thereupon wearing a thin cloth, holding kusagrass by his fingers, and reciting Vedic hymns he proceededto the banks of Saraju. Having given up all actions ofsenses, and suffered the pains of going on foot he issuedout of the city speechless like unto the burning sun. Onhis right hand side was the lotus-handed Sree, on his lefthand side was the goddess Earth and before him was thepower of destruction. Various arrows, huge bows, anddaggers, assuming forms followed him. And also went withhim the four Vedas in the shape of the Brāhmanas, the allprotecting Gayatri, Omkāra and Vasatkāra. The high-souledRishis and great Asuras followed the high-souled Rāma tothe open gates of heaven. All the female servants, old andyoung, the damsels of the seraglio accompanied by servantshaving no manhood, Bharata and Lakshmana accompaniedby their wives, followed him with Agnihotra. All thosehigh-souled ones, assembled there with Agnihotra andfollowed Kākuthstha with their wives and children. Theministers and the servants, with their sons, beasts and friends,followed Rāma delightedly. Thereupon all the subjectshealthy and delighted went after Rāghava, attracted by hisaccomplishments and cleansed of their sins. All the femalesand males, with their beasts, birds and friends, delightedlyfollowed Rāghava. Bathed and delighted, all the monkeys,healthy and joyous following Rāma, created a continued tumult.There was none poorly, aggrieved or miserable—all of themappeared wonderfully happy and delighted. When Rāmaissued out of the city, whoever came to see him followed himbeing desirous of going to heaven. Bears, monkeys andRākshasas and all the citizens followed him with greatdevotion and collected minds. And all other animals, thatwere beyond the view of all in the city went after Rāghavaproceeding to heaven. All creations mobile and immobile,whoever beheld Kākuthstha followed him. All beings inAyodhyā, whoever breathe and are very minute,accompanied Rāma."

  "Uttara Kānda": "Having thus gone for more than a half Yojana, thedescendant of Raghu espied Saraju of holy watersflowing towards the west. And having crossed that river ofrising waves to some extent, Rāma, with his followersarrived at the place where he should give up his person.Thereupon at that moment, Brahmā, the grandfather of allencircled by all high-souled deities and with hundred kotisof celestial cars, arrived there where Kākuthstha hadaddressed himself to repair to heaven. The aerial way wasfull of lustre but its brilliance was increased the moreby the native effulgence of the inhabitants of heavens,always performing pious actions. There blew the holy,fragrant and delightful winds and there fell profuselycelestial flowers from the hands of the deities. The placewas filled with the noise of hundreds of bugles sounded byGandharvas and Apsarās. And then Rāma preparedhimself to descend to the waters of Saraju. Thereupon thePatriarch gave vent to the following accents from thewelkin:—“Come O Vishnu; may good betide thee; by ourgood fortune thou art coming here; O Rāghava hear—Othou having mighty arms, do thou enter here with thybrothers, resembling the celestials in brilliance in whateverform thou likest—either in that of the sky or in thy ownVishnu form. Thou art the refuge of the creatures—nobodyknoweth thee. Thou art above the range of thought; greatimmortal and imperishable; nobody knoweth thee saveMāyā, having wide eyes, thy former spouse. Do thou enterhere thyself in whatever effulgent form thou likest.” Hearingthe words of the Patriarch and determining everythingthe high-minded Rāma entered there bodily with his brothersin his Vishnu form. Thereupon all the celestials SādhyasMarutas, headed by Indra and Agni worshipped that deity,Vishnu. So did all the celestial Rishis, Gandharvas, Apsarās,Suparnas, Nāgas, Yakhas, demons, Dānavas and Rākshasas.Thereupon eulogising him the celestials said:—\"Our regionis now freed from sins and all here have been delightedand all their desires have been fulfilled.\" Thereupon thehighly effulgent Vishnu said to the PatriarchBrahmā:—\"It behoveth thee, O thou of good vows, to allot tothose people their proper regions. These illustrious oneshave followed me out of love. They are worthy of myrespect for they are my devotees and have renouncedtheir persons for me.\" Hearing the words of Vishnu, thelord Brahmā, father of all creatures, said:—\"All thesepeople who have come here shall go to the region namedSantanaka. This region is intended even for him, whothough born in the most degraded state, thinks of allobjects as Vishnu. There is no question about their attainingto this region who, out of devotion, have followed thee andrenounced their persons. This region has all the attributesof the Brahmā region and is next to it. The monkeys andbears shall enter into their respective celestial forms. Theyshall enter into the deities from whom they had respectivelyoriginated. Sugriva shall enter into the Sun's region. Andthey shall obtain their respective fathers' forms among thecelestials present.\" The lord of the deities having said this,all those who were present at the holy pilgrimage of Gopratradescended into the waters of Saraju with eyes full of tearsof joy. Having bathed there, given up their lives delightedlyand renounced their human forms they ascended the celestialcars. And having obtained the waters of Saraju, hundredsof those that were born in the race of birds attained to theland of immortals obtaining the respective celestial forms(they had before). And in those celestial forms, they lookedeffulgent like the deities. And going to the waters of Sarajuall objects, mobile and immobile, having bathed there, repairedto the excellent celestial region. Having renounced theirbodies in the water thereof all the bears, monkeys, andRakshasas attained to the land of deities. Having thussettled in heaven all those arrived there the father, of creatureswith the deities, delighted and happy, repaired to the highestheaven."

Thereupon asbefore, Vishnu, who compriseth the three worlds and allobjects, mobile and immobile, again established himself asbefore in the land of immortals. Thereupon the celestialsthe Gandharvas, the great Rishis used to hear happily everyday in heaven this poem of Rāmāyana. At the Sarādhaceremony the wise should chant this Rāmāyana sacred likethe Vedas, removing sins and increasing life and prosperity.Reading even a single verse of this poem, one who hath noson, obtaineth him; one having no riches, gets by them—andpeople are freed from all sins. By reading even one slokapeople are freed from all sins which they commit every day.Clothes, cows, and gold should be conferred upon him whochants this poem, for he being pleased all the deities remainsatisfied. Whoever reads this story of Rāmāyana, conferringa long life is honoured in this world along with his sonsand grand-sons and as well as in the land of the dead.Whoever shall read this Rāmāyana either in the morning, noon,or evening, shall never be wearied. The picturesque city ofAyodhyā remained devoid of men for many long years butwas again peopled under the regime of the King Rishava,Pracheta’s son Vālmiki composed this poem, conferring longlife, together with the future story of the deity and theUttara Kandam.
