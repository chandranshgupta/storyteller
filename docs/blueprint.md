# **App Name**: Nakshatra Narratives

## Core Features:

- Celestial Navigation: Interactive starfield map using React Three Fiber (R3F) to display Nakshatras (constellations) from an Earth viewpoint, inspired by sites like stellarium-web.org.
- Falling Star Transition: Trigger a star to fall toward the screen upon constellation selection, initiating a transition to the corresponding story.
- Interactive Manuscript Generation: Blossom of falling star landing on canvas for generating interactive manuscript with a warm Papyrus & Ink theme and a textured, off-white background.
- Chapter Transition: Seamlessly transform the 2D manuscript into a 3D story world upon chapter click.
- Character-Driven Narration: Voice synthesizer that uses the Gemini AI to provide voice context for character roles for stories.
- Hero's POV Toggle: Allow users to experience the story from a specific character's perspective, guided by the AI. The Gemini AI tool may select supporting details for output.
- Accessibility Features: Integrate full audio narration and animated sign language powered through Javascript accessibility packages.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Warm tan (#D2B48C), reminiscent of papyrus, evoking a sense of history and warmth.
- Background color: Near-white (#F8F8F2), a textured, desaturated tan to provide a subtle, tactile feel, akin to aged paper.
- Accent color: Deep brown (#553B28), reminiscent of ink, to offer high contrast and ground the design.
- Font pairing: 'Playfair' (serif) for headlines to give an elegant and high-end feel; 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text to ensure readability and a modern touch.
- Stylized 3D “Digital Artifacts” representing key story elements (Rama's bow, Krishna's chakra) as navigation points. Minimal, symbolic representations in deep brown.
- Use a scroll-driven narrative style where visuals and story elements assemble themselves as the user scrolls ('Divine Manifestation').
- Subtle, ethereal animations for constellation transitions and manuscript transformations.
