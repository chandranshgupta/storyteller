üåå Vedic Narratives: An Immersive Storytelling Experience

An immersive web experience weaving ancient tales of the Ramayana and Nakshatras through AI-powered shadow puppetry and interactive lore.
üìú About The Project

This project is a digital space where ancient Indian mythology meets modern technology. We're bridging the gap between traditional storytelling and contemporary web experiences. The core idea is to present the epic Ramayana not just as text, but as a visual, immersive journey.

We're using AI to generate videos in the style of Tholpavakuthu, a traditional shadow puppet theatre from Kerala, India, bringing a unique and authentic aesthetic to the narrative. Alongside the Ramayana, the app features Nakshatra Narratives, an interactive exploration of the constellations and their stories in Vedic astrology.

This is more than just an e-reader; it's a digital temple of stories.
‚ú® Key Features

    AI-Powered Shadow Puppet Theatre: Watch the Ramayana unfold through beautifully generated videos that mimic traditional Tholpavakuthu.

    Interactive Nakshatra Map: Explore the 27 Nakshatras through an interactive star map, complete with their associated stories and lore.

    Character Lore Explorer: Dive deep into the backstories, motivations, and significance of key characters from the epics.

    Full Epic Text: Read the complete Ramayana, sourced from Project Gutenberg, right within the application.

    Modern, Responsive UI: A clean, elegant interface designed for an uninterrupted and immersive experience on any device.
